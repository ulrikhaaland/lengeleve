Diagram of a skeletal muscle fiber. Image credit: Wikipedia \\Muscle fibers are basically long cylinders\\If you think about this like a ponytail\\A ponytail is nothing but a collective, a whole bunch of individual hairs; and this is how you can think of skeletal muscle\\Skeletal muscle is a long, long cylinder; it is very strong\\Cardiac, and smooth muscle are quite different\\The function of the muscle fiber is to contract \\If you look at the whole muscle, it is surrounded by a bed of capillaries \\As blood goes into a muscle, it comes in the big artery, then it’s going to go through a bunch of capillaries, and those capillaries are really surrounding, and mixing in and out that whole ponytail\\Capillaries all over, and so they’re circulating around the individual fibers\\That’s going to get you nutrients in (like glucose or anything else), and get waste products out (like carbon dioxide, etc.) \\Visualize that big long cylinder, the capillaries are around it, and you have a whole bunch of organelles that do things\\Probably the most pertinent is what are called nuclei, these are called myonuclei\\If you remember basic biology, the nucleus is what controls any cell",

Macro view of muscle contraction.

Muscles of the leg. Image credit: NCI\\We call muscle fibers one-on-one, but really there’s a distinction between them\\All the way back to the invention of the microscope (by Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek); one of the first things the microscope was used for was looking at individual cells\\He started looking at muscle in whales, in codfish, and a bunch of other stuff\\He started to notice that some of these cells are really small, and some of them are really big, and that’s the very first time we started to functionally distinguish between big fibers and small fibers\\Pretty quickly after that, he started to realize that some of them are really red and some of them are more white\\For a number of centuries we distinguished muscle as these fiber types (either red cells or white cells), and it took a long time to figure out why that mattered or what that meant\\Eventually, it became clear that the ones that are red are red, because they have more of capillaries, more blood flow, more mitochondria\\They have more iron which gives an actual look of being red\\The white ones have less of it\\For a long time after that, we didn’t know functionally what that meant\\As soon as histology came around we started to realize that we can test the individual muscle fibers for their power output (contraction)\\You take individual muscle fibers out of the muscle, put them in a Petri dish, tie one end to a forced transducer, try the other end to a fixed unit, and put it in a bath of calcium, ATP, and a bunch of other stuff\\And those fibers just start contracting unlimited, and you can actually measure how much force is being produced\\This allowed us to go from distinguishing these fibers via color (red versus white), to distinguishing them by their contractile properties\\I.e. is it contracting with a lot of force or a small amount of force?\\In fact, force wasn’t really the distinguishing factor, it was speed, and because of that, we started the nomenclature involved to now describe them as fast-twitch, or slow-twitch\\That really specifically describes the twitch or the contraction speed \\Two ways to distinguish muscle fibers are by color or contractile speed \\Eventually, we started to figure out their enzymatic differences (a 3rd way to categorize muscle fibers) \\Muscle fibers that had more mitochondria (red fibers) were better at using aerobic metabolism \\This is carbohydrate and fat metabolism\\The ones that were white or fast were much better at using glycolysis from the anaerobic part of the equation\\This occurs in the cytoplasm, outside of the mitochondria\\You might have heard them described as fast oxidative or fast glycolytic\\Initially when this distinction was drawn, there were two types of muscle fibers ‒ Type I and Type II",

    "content": "\\ Type I is the slow-twitch fibers, the red fibers, the oxidative fiber\\ Type II were the fast-twitch\\In the 1950s, we started to figure out that there is a 3rd distinct fiber type \\This fiber type was more closely aligned to the fast-twitch fibers than the slow-twitch\\So now we have Type I, Type IIa, and Type IIb\\ Type IIa and Type IIb are distinct but are more similar to each other than they are to Type I fibers\\Some years passed and in 1990 we eventually realized that humans don’t have Type IIb\\However, humans do have what’s called Type IIx \\Andy’s summary of muscle fiber types: \\Humans have three muscle fiber types (Type I, Type IIa, & Type IIx), while most other animals have four types (Type I, Type IIa, Type IIb, & Type IIx)\\In terms of speed Type IIb are ultrafast, Type IIb > Type IIx > Type IIa > Type I\\Type I muscle fibers are less fatigable; they have more mitochondria but don’t produce as much force; they’re slower\\As you move from Type IIA to Type IIx they become faster but more fatigable (because they are more reliant upon glycolysis and carbohydrate metabolism)\\Figure 4. Summary of muscle fiber types (Type IIb are not found in humans) \\How does the soleus and gastrocnemius compare in humans? \\The gastroc in most humans is around 60-70% Type IIa fibers (maybe even up to 80%), and so they’re very, very fast\\The gastroc will again cause a fast contraction, but they won’t hold on for very long, because they are fatigable\\The soleus can be up to 90% slow-twitch\\This is a great comparison, because most muscles in your body are some combination of fast- or slow-twitch, but the soleus and the gastroc are probably the best example of the two extremes \\In mice, the soleus is 100% slow-twitch\\In humans, if a biopsy showed their soleus was 80% slow-twitch, that would be pretty high\\Likewise, in humans if their gastroc was 70% fast-twitch, that would be pretty high\\This matters functionally\\If you have a compromised soleus, you’re probably less likely to be standing; you’re going to sit and be less physically active\\If the [gastroc] is compromised, it’s hard to move fast and powerfully\\How modifiable is that distribution? Is it purely genetic, or is there a trainable component to the ratio of fast to slow-twitch fiber in a given muscle? [16:40] tk\\It is extremely trainable; it comes down to stimuli and time\\The more stimuli you give it, and the more time you give it, the more it will change\\Like anything else, an asymptote exists here \\If you are untrained, physically inactive, in a cast for two months, go into space flight ‒ responsiveness to training happens faster\\If you are well-trained, as months and years go on, you start changing really, really slowly, because you are closer to the end of the spectrum\\Figure 5. Hypothetical responsiveness to training is untrained and well-trained individuals. (Asymptote from Wikipedia)\\Functionally, there is no limit to how far you can go, given enough total exposure \\To put some realistic numbers on the gastroc, in an untrained individual who hadn’t exercised for 5+ years, 8 weeks of exercise could cause 10-15% change in fiber type  \\Does this mean more type II muscle fibers are expressed and less type I? Is this change due to making new cells and apoptosis of old cells?  \\Generally no\\There’s this idea called hyperplasia; hyperplasia is when you would grow a new cell\\That is very, very uncommon in normal human situations\\It can happen with extreme eccentric training\\It looks like it probably happens with a lot of exogenous testosterone use over many, many years\\You can get it in cell culture, and you can get it in animal models\\But in normal human situations, hyperplasia is very uncommon\\In humans, what more commonly happens is the current fiber type will transition its type\\Remember there are three fiber types in humans; that’s not actually true either; there’s a whole combination of what we call hybrids   ",

We don’t really care about the size of your hepatocytes, we care about the functional units, and how they integrate. We care about the function…”\\He has never given much thought to, “Are my hepatocytes the same size as your hepatocytes?
