    "content": "Skeletal muscle is a collective group of muscles that contract to move bones. Different muscles have different orientations and responsibilities, some are meant to be antigravity and non-fatigable, while others provide power and propulsion. Muscle also pumps fluid up and down, stores amino acids, and regulates blood glucose. Each muscle is made up of billions of individual muscle fibers that contract and are surrounded by capillaries for nutrient exchange. The muscle fibers contain myonuclei which control the cell.",

The more nuclei a muscle has, the easier it is to respond to stressors, damage, and adaptations. Mitochondria are also important for producing cellular energy. Finally, the contractile units of muscle fibers are actin and myosin, which contract together and stack on top of each other, causing the muscle to gain height when flexed.",

Reps in reserve is a similar idea; if you thought you could do 10 reps and you wanted to do 2 reps in reserve, you would stop at 8 reps (so there are 2 reps left in reserve). You would do a set of 4 and have 1 rep in reserve; so you get to the end of that 4 and maybe have 1-2 reps in reserve. Peter thinks that reps in reserve is easier to explain to people, but at the same time, you have to know what failure is. This is not something you can figure out by yourself. You have to have the experience of dropping a bar on your chest and having the guys run across the gym to pick it up. Andy suggests using a machine to safely determine RPE and RIR. People who are not highly trained fail epically when trying to determine RPE and RIR. People will think they are at a RIR of 2 but it is really more like a 7.

Again, most people can’t hold 250 watts for 2 minutes. This is not suggesting that cycling training is great for power development, instead world-caliber athletes are good at a lot of things.

Movement mechanics, being smooth, and having the rhythm to move fast is very, very challenging. This is called synchronization ‒ you have to fire the right muscles in the right group, in the right order, throughout your gait while running. This is not necessary in powerlifting because everything is on maximally. You’ll commonly hear sprinters say, “You got to be in the right rhythm”. You might get faster without actually improving your velocity ability by just getting in better rhythm. This means learning what to fire, what to relax, so a joint can move, and then be ready to strike again, and again. It can be both autonomic and conscious. The idea would be to make this as subconscious as possible, so in the moment you’re relaxed and moving. Initially when you learn it, it’s going to be very conscious.",

It’s cool to be a CrossFitter, a Strongman, an elite runner, cyclist, swimmer, whatever, but I’m going to pick a different sport. I’m going to pick a sport where the optimization is around my ability to be as physically robust as possible in the last decade of my life, which means I want to be able to do a bunch of things that most people can’t even fathom when they’re 80 or 90 years old.” One of the biggest trade-offs you have to make is optimizing against getting injured. Because the compounding effect of training is so strong that it’s rivaled only by the compounding effect of not training. “You will lose it way faster than you will gain it, and therefore, you could argue rule number one of what I’m proposing is, you can’t ever stop training”‒ Peter Attia. What would we take from training for each of these phenotypes into our centenarian decathlon? Let’s work backwards, beginning with physiology. There are 3 things you need to train, and you can mix and match from any of those areas. 1 – High-quality functioning muscle. 2 – Nervous system (peripheral and central), our motor control needs to be very, very astute.",

This seems to happen to the athlete who has been inactive for a while, then he goes right back to that indoor soccer match and boom, it’s so loud you can hear it across the gym. This occurs when you ask connective tissue (the Achilles tendon) to do maximum contraction on a hyper loaded eccentric stop and change when it’s never contracted more than 50% of it’s max for years. You’re going to tear something somewhere. It’s probably not going to be an ACL, the Achilles is going to go first. In pro sports it’s the opposite, the Achilles is going to handle the load and the ACL will tear first. This is easy to avoid with some tissue tolerance, which is a fancy way of saying expose that tissue to demand slowly, and slowly increase the demand over time. One thing Peter finds is great for this is warming up with some sort of jumping. Especially as he is getting older. It’s multiplanar. It’s simple back and forth, side to side, and then one leg out. Like doing the clock, one o’clock, two o’clock, three o’clock, four o’clock, five o’clock, and by five and six o’clock, you’re actually having to spin yourself backwards, and you’re always coming back to the center of the clock, if that makes sense. These aren’t huge jumps. The goal is to introduce lower leg variability and tension with the tendons and connective tissue at unusual angles. This is why Andy is now more of a proponent of running for health than he used to be. Initially he was apprehensive because of the high rate of injury from running. But now he has changed his thoughts on that because a small amount of running is enough to keep tissue tolerance through most of the lower half. A few miles a week; a normal human should be able to run a mile. A little bit of sprinting in the straightaways is good too; do two laps and walk the corners. This will help you stay away from a lot of foot- and Achilles-related injuries.",
