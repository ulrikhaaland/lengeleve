  "content": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered to be one of the most preventable cancer mortalities. About one-third of people diagnosed with Stage III colon cancer will not be alive 5 years after diagnosis. Routine CRC screening is unanimously recommended by the American Cancer Society (ACS), the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for average-risk persons aged 50 to 75. There are several different screening methods endorsed by these institutions that break down into two categories: stool-based tests and direct visualization tests. If a polyp is found, it will usually be removed and later examined to determine its type (i.e., hyperplastic, adenomatous, malignant). In other words, colonoscopy has the ability to both catch and remove polyps before they turn cancerous.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In May 2018, the ACS updated its CRC guidelines based on a modeling analysis, recommending regular screening begin at age 45 for people at average risk. In practice, average-risk individuals are typically encouraged to get a colonoscopy by age 40, but even sooner if anything suggests they may be at higher risk. This includes a family or personal history of colorectal cancer, a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, and hereditary syndromes such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. The US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) on Colorectal Cancer suggests people at average risk should begin at age 45 for African Americans, 5 years before patients of all other races, on the basis that they have higher overall incidence rates and younger mean age at onset of CRC.",

  "date": "September 27, 2020",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "One of the most serious complications of colonoscopy is perforation of the colon, which reportedly occurs in about 1-in-every-3,000 colonoscopies in screening populations or generally asymptomatic people. There are also the risks associated with anesthesia during the procedure. There’s also an opportunity cost (economically) to early screening, as it is not covered by insurance and can be pricey (about $1,000-$3,000). Before you get your first colonoscopy, there are few things you can do that may improve your risk-to-benefit ratio. You should ask what your endoscopist’s adenoma detection rate (ADR) is. You should also ask your endoscopist how many perforations he or she has caused, specifically, as well as any other serious complications, like major intestinal bleeding episodes (in a routine screening setting).",

  "title": "Follow-up Screening and Polyp Miss Rate",
  "date": "September 27, 2020",
  "context": "Cancer",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The timing of follow-up screening is based on the results of your first colonoscopy. If it was normal, the institutional guidelines recommend getting your next one in 10 years. But this recommendation assumes a high-quality baseline colonoscopy. There are a few things you should know after your colonoscopy to determine how good it was. Was the colonoscopist able to perform a complete examination of the colon? Was the bowel preparation and visualization of the colon ideal? The “polyp miss rate” must be discussed. Jerry Waye, a pioneer in colonoscopy, points to tandem studies—where back-to-back colonoscopies are performed on the same day in the same individuals—reporting that about 30% of polyps are overlooked. The smaller the polyp, the lower the chance of detection, and the inverse is also true. Larger polyps show a miss rate in the range of 6-12%. When you put it all together, the miss rate in polyps of all types and sizes is in the range of 15-31%.",

  "context": "Cancer",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "All of the existing randomized-controlled-trial data for CRC endoscopy screening looks at flexible sigmoidoscopy and not colonoscopy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy doesn’t look at the entire colon, it looks at the lower and left side of the colon, but does not look at the rest of the colon. Despite this limitation, flexible sigmoidoscopy (every 5 years) probably has the best-looking data for any screening test in terms of lowering cancer- and all-cause mortality. Recent RCT data shows a 26% lower CRC mortality in screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy, with a repeat screening at 3 or 5 years, and a meta-analysis showed a reduction in all-cause mortality of 3 deaths per 1,000 persons invited to screening after 11.5 years of follow-up.",

  "content": "Colonoscopy looks at the right-side of the colon while flexible sigmoidoscopy does not. Poor cecal intubation rates, relatively higher risk of complications, worse bowel preparation on the right side of the colon, and the greater prevalence of more sessile serrated polyps may suggest that right-sided lesions are less amenable to a reduction in CRC mortality. However, it is believed that we have a better chance of saving more lives from CRC and all-cause mortality by looking at the site with the highest proportion of CRC.",
