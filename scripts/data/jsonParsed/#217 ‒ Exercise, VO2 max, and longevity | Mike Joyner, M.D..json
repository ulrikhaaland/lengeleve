By the time  he was 20-25, in medical school, his max heart rate dropped immediately to about 180. It became very difficult to get his heart rate over 180 which was far lower than what is predicted by 220 minus your age. Mike adds that his was never very high to begin with. He’s 60 and he focuses on what his workload is. Over 12 weeks of de-training, his peak heart rate went up 10 beats a minute to the high 190s. This would be 220 minus his age. There’s a bunch of data on elite athletes showing that some have peak heart rates similar to 220 minus their age, but many are lower than that. There have been world record holders, Olympic champions that had peak heart rates in the 150s.",

Another example is a man named Bob Schul, an American who won the 5,000 in 1964. He did interval training all day and all night. It was incredible how he trained; his heart rate was around 154, 156. Jim Ryun, the great miler, his heart rate was not particularly high in his 20s. They must have incredible stroke volume; big hearts, big pumps.",

He can run a 4:40 mile (over 12 mph) at levels it barely nudges lactate acid levels. When Mike first started thinking about this and making models of performance, he thought that the highest number was 85% of max. It’s probably closer to 90% for somebody like Kipchoge.

Mike thinks a lot of what’s happened in terms of at the very edge of things has been better races. Now also, people have longer careers. Sports medicine is better, so if people get injured, they can recover. They don’t stop when they’re 25-26.

He’s a big believer in what’s called “hard easy”‒ a hard day followed by an easy day. What he’ll do on a hard day‒ 1 – Warm-up on a stationary bike and the rowing machine for 10 to 15 minutes. 2 – A circuit that starts with 25 squat thrusts, a minute of jumping rope, static wall sit to failure, and then some drop sets where he goes down the weight stack. Then drop sets with incline flies. Then drop sets with leg extensions. And drop sets with a combination of pull ups and lat pull downs and military presses. Then some additional stuff for his legs. Pushups, bar dips, and upright rows, followed by something else for his legs. He alternates arms and legs and works his way through this with no rest. Drop sets on each thing for all large major muscle masses. And that takes about 22 minutes for 1 circuit. 3 – Then he’ll get on the bike and he’ll do 8 times 3 minutes of a ladder. He starts unloaded, goes up a notch for 30 seconds, go up a notch, go up a notch, and he’ll get to maybe about 350 watts for the last 30 seconds. Then he’ll come back down to about 100 watts. It takes him 3 minutes to do this ladder up to 350 watts. Then he’ll bike at 100 watts for 30 seconds, move up to 150 W for 30 seconds, 200 W for 30, 250 for 30, 300 for 30, 350 for 30, then back down to 100 for 30. 8 repetitions of this ladder takes 1 hour. He does not rest between sets. Remember Mike is doing those ladders after a heavy leg workout. His legs are pretty fatigued. Mike does a hard day every other day or every 3rd day. His easy days are 30-40 minutes in the morning. Sometimes he does one in the morning. Sometimes when he comes home from work he’ll do another one. The goal for the easy day is an old concept called active rest. He’s not trying to get a real training effect. He’s trying to loosen up from previous day’s workout because he’s sore. He’ll do this for about 6 months. And then probably when it starts getting dark again, he’ll start doing a kind of maintenance circuits, in terms of the strength. It may be only twice a week.

For example, get on a bike on an incline (not very steep, maybe 6% grade). He wants to stay in the saddle climbing against resistance for 4 minutes. He never wants the resistance to go away. He uses a power meter and tracks heart rate. This is followed by 4 minutes of recovery. Literally doing nothing but rolling back to the starting line. Repeat. Mike agrees with Peter. Mike tells people who want to run a faster marathon or whatever, they need to get their VO2 max up. These are people who are running a lot of miles. Sometimes he recommends 5 minutes of work and 3 minutes of rest. People who are fitter only need 2 minutes of rest. To put this in the context of running, run at your 5 K race pace. Maybe the first one is a little slower. Then each one gets progressively faster. You would jog in between or if you’re not going fast, walk in between. The classic training among elite runners is mile repeats. 4-5 times one mile. And then they jog a quarter mile or a half mile in between. Mike has personally have seen really good runners do 4:30, 4:25, 4:20, 4:15, 4:10, 4:05. These were people getting ready for the Olympics. Peter notes that he and Mike have trained their whole lives, so they know what going all out for 4 minutes feels like.

Mike remembers Patrick’s encyclopedic knowledge of everything that’s ever been synthesized in the androgen field and what it does in terms of half life and metabolism etc. Similarly, think of Victor Conte Jr., from the Tower of Power‒  another autodidact. He was a junior college educated rock/jazz musician. For both of these individuals, if you step back from the legal and ethical ramifications and ask, what do they know? And try to be a little bit objective about that. In the cultures they were operating in, this was considered the cultural norm.",

What the Russians did less than a decade ago was relatively low dose by comparison. “I do think that industrial strength doping has largely been stopped, prevented”‒ Mike Joyner. There are probably a bunch of novel compounds out there. Small peptides that cause this to be released or that to be released, which would be very difficult to detect. They’d have vanishing short half-lives. And they would just boost your endogenous production of hormone X, Y, or Z, something like a growth hormone-releasing factor, something that caused testosterone levels to go up or suffer. It’s a cat and mouse game, for kind of the big three‒ amphetamines, EPO/ blood doping, and anabolic steroids/growth hormone.",

The same would be true with low dose EPO and/or related compounds. You learn about athletes getting busted for growth hormones when person X says they’re sending FedEx packages to athlete Y.

  "content": "Can the miracle of exercise be put in a pill? Can some of the benefits of exercise be captured by a pharmaceutical strategy? Peter remarks, “We started this discussion, Mike, by talking about the miracles of exercise, right? We went through all of these things that exercise is doing physiologically and how the net impact on things is so profound‒  on the length of your life and the quality of your life. There’s no shortage of pharma companies out there that are trying to understand‒  how can those benefits be put into a pill?” Success in research has primarily focused on things that increase mitochondrial biosynthesis. This appears to work in animal models. Next, how do you translate it? Exercise makes your mitochondria better or makes more of them. But [a pill] making your mitochondria better isn’t going to make your autonomic nervous system better, isn’t going to make your blood pressure better, isn’t going to necessarily make the lining of your blood vessels better, isn’t going to make your heart bigger, and so on and so forth. So far, these have been sort of one-trick ponies. They might provide some benefits for people that are wheelchair bound, quadriplegics, or people who can’t exercise for some other reason. Mike thinks the jury is still out. He remarks, “I’m not particularly enthusiastic about it. I don’t think you’re ever going to get one that does any more than a little bit.” Mike likes to tell people there’s already an exercise medic out there‒  the polypill. Look at the data on people who get a combination/ one-pill-a-day of low-dose statins + low-dose blood pressure meds + 1 or 2 other components. It causes pretty nice reductions in risk factors in most people. The side effects tend to be low because it’s low-dose. But none of this is patentable. For people who don’t want to exercise (or can’t exercise), the better choice would be to use a polypill which would do the same things. A statin would cause their cholesterol to go down and maybe improve their endothelial function. A tiny bit of Metformin might improve their glucose tolerance. A beta blocker might lower their heart rate. Mike’s not advocating this, but there’s data out there suggesting that a polypill is a “legitimate” public health strategy for lifestyle diseases. Mike would encourage people to exercise and do the things discussed. He also thinks polypills have been understudied.",
