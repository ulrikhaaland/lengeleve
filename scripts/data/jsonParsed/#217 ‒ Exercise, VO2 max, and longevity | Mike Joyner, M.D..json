However, there are logistical issues around getting these people to the blood collection center. The blood should be typed in cross, and donors have to be eligible to otherwise donate blood. During the peak of plasma use, around 20,000 to 40,000 units a week were being used in the country. There was a correlation between the use of convalescent plasma and a lower death rate 2 weeks later.",

  "content": "There is a need for society to address the issue of physical activity. While upper middle class kids have access to superb coaching and facilities, there is a problem with play and unstructured play for many others. Opportunities for unstructured play time in parks and at school have fallen by the wayside. The lack of open gyms, especially during summer, is a problem. The idea of a national open gym movement is suggested as a solution.",

For example, secretaries at the Mayo Clinic would bring their tennis shoes and walk around the hospital's large bunker system during their lunch break. This not only provided them with physical activity but also served as a social event and increased their productivity.",
