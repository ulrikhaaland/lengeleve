  "content": "Cholesterol is an essential organic molecule in our body. We eat it, we make it, we store it, and we excrete it. Cholesterol exists in 2 forms – unesterified or 'free' and esterified. Much of the cholesterol we eat is not absorbed and is excreted by our gut. The cholesterol we synthesize in our body is the dominant source of the cholesterol in our body. The process of regulating cholesterol is very complex and multifaceted. Eating cholesterol has very little impact on the cholesterol levels in your body.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Cholesterol and triglycerides are not soluble in plasma and are therefore said to be hydrophobic. To be carried anywhere in our body, they need to be carried by a special protein-wrapped transport vessel called a lipoprotein. As these lipoproteins leave the liver they undergo a process of maturation where they shed much of their triglyceride 'cargo' in the form of free fatty acid, and doing so makes them smaller and richer in cholesterol. Special proteins, apoproteins, play an important role in moving lipoproteins around the body and facilitating their interactions with other cells.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The measurement of cholesterol has undergone a dramatic evolution over the past 70 years with technology at the heart of the advance. Currently, most people undergo a 'standard' lipid panel which only directly measures TC, TG, and HDL-C. LDL-C is measured or most often estimated. More advanced cholesterol measuring tests do exist to directly measure LDL-C, along with the cholesterol content of other lipoproteins or lipoprotein subparticles.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The presence of sterols in arterial wall macrophages is the sine qua non of atherosclerosis. Sterols are delivered to the arterial wall by the penetration of the endothelium by an apoB-containing lipoprotein, which transport the sterols. Unless an apoB-containing lipoprotein particle violates the border created by an endothelium cell and the layer it protects, the media layer, there is no way atherogenesis occurs. The endothelium is the one-cell-thick-layer which lines the lumen of a vessel. All lipoproteins – including LDL particles – come in constant contact with such cells.",

  "title": "LDL Particles and Atherosclerosis",
  "date": "May 17, 2012",
  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The proteoglycans further shift the balance of LDL particle movement towards retention. More and more apoB containing particles (i.e., LDL particles and the few other particles containing apoB) enter the sub-endothelial space and continue to be retained, due to the existing “room” being created by the immune response. As this process continues, an even more advanced form of immune response – mediated by cells called T-cells – leads to further retention and destruction of the artery wall. Eventually, not only does the lumen of the artery narrow, but a fibrous cap develops and plaques take form. It is most often these plaques that lead to myocardial infarction, or heart attacks, as they eventually dislodge and acutely obstruct blood flow to the portion of muscle supplied by the artery.",

  "content": "The column on the left uses a stain to highlight the distinction between the intimal and media layer of the artery call. The middle column uses a special stain to highlight the presence of lipids within the intimal layer. The right column uses yet a different stain to highlight the presence of macrophages in the intima and the media. What is particularly compelling about this sequence of figures is that you can see the trigger of events from what is called diffuse intimal thickening (“DIT”), which exacerbates the retention of lipoproteins and their lipid cargo, only then to be followed by the arrival of immune cells, which ultimately lead the inflammatory changes responsible for atherosclerosis.",

  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Empirically, we know that the most successful pharmacologic interventions demonstrated to reduce coronary artery disease are those that reduce LDL-P and thus delivery of sterols to the artery. Perhaps more compelling is the “natural experiment” of people with genetic alterations leading to elevated or reduced LDL-P. So why does having an LDL-P of 2,000 nmol/L (95th percentile) increase the risk of atherosclerosis relative to, say, 1,000 nmol/L (20th percentile)? In the end, it’s a probabilistic game. The more particles – NOT cholesterol molecules within the particles and not the size of the LDL particles – you have, the more likely the chance a LDL-P is going to ding an endothelial cell, squeeze into the sub-endothelial space and begin the process of atherosclerosis.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Beyond the LDL particle, other apoB-containing lipoproteins also play a role in the development of atherosclerosis, especially in an increasingly insulin resistant population like ours. In fact, there is some evidence that particle-for-particle Lp(a) is actually even more atherogenic than LDL (though we have far fewer of them). The apo(a) also retards clearance of Lp(a) thus enhancing LDL-P levels. It may foster greater penetration of the endothelium and/or greater retention within the sub-endothelial space and/or elicit an even greater immune response.",

  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The progression from a completely normal artery to an atherosclerotic one which may or may not be “clogged” follows a very clear path: an apoB containing particle gets past the endothelial layer into the sub-endothelial space, the particle and its cholesterol content is retained and oxidized, immune cells arrive, an initially-beneficial inflammatory response occurs that ultimately becomes maladaptive leading to complex plaque. While inflammation plays a key role in this process, it’s the penetration of the apoB particle, with its sterol passengers, of the endothelium and retention within the sub-endothelial space that drive the process. The most numerous apoB containing lipoprotein in this process is certainly the LDL particle, however Lp(a) (if present) and other apoB containing lipoproteins may play a role.",
