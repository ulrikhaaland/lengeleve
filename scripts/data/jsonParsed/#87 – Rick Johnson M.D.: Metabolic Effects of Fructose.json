  "content": "In this episode, Rick Johnson, professor of nephrology at the University of Colorado, explains how his research into the causes of blood pressure resulted in a change of research direction to focus more on how fructose has such profound metabolic effects. Rick begins by talking about the relationship between salt and high blood pressure, then provides a masterclass into uric acid, and then expertly reveals the mechanisms and pathways by which sugar (specifically fructose) can profoundly impact metabolic health. From there, he explains how he applies this information to real life patients as well as touches on some of the most promising ideas around pharmacotherapy that are being developed in response to the epidemics of fatty liver, insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity. Furthermore, Rick gives his take on artificial sweeteners compared to real sugar, discusses cancer’s affinity for fructose, and much more.",

A few million years later, global cooling made it too cold in Europe to have year round fruit. And many of them starved to death. However, a small subset of them developed a mutation in uric acid metabolism that gave them a superpower. That superpower was that they could be much more efficient at turning fructose into fat. They had this little by-product which they would also make a boatload of uric acid along the way. Those apes with that mutation returned to Africa and ultimately seeded the rest of the species. Ultimately, that’s why we as humans are among the very rare animals that have uric acid levels that are quite high relative to other animals (cats and dogs, for example).",

When metabolizing glucose, the body has a system whereby it feeds back to stop the process before any significant ATP depletion occurs. But when fructose is metabolized, the enzyme that metabolizes fructose is called fructokinase, and when that metabolizes fructose, it consumes ATP in an unregulated way. So if the cell sees a lot of fructose, the ATP levels can plummet by 40 or 50% in the cell. And that produces a “May Day” signal, “we’re under attack, we’re running out of energy!”",

Salt and obesity and diabetes: But high salt diets aren’t just about blood pressure… High salt diets are associated with obesity and the development of diabetes.

However, increased water intake may slow the progression of kidney disease. Can drinking water help keep you skinny? Many animals use fructose to make fat as a means for making water. When you make fat, although there’s no water stored in the fat, when you burn the fat, it makes water. Fructose drives fat production in part to preserve water (not just energy). If you take an animal that’s consuming high fructose, you can suppress some of the obesity and metabolic syndrome by giving it a lot of water. And so the old wives tale that ‘drinking six glasses of water a day is good to help keep you skinny’ is true. It turns out that water suppresses some of the effects of fructose.",

  "content": "What advice does Rick have to “healthy” people? 1 | Reduce fructose. If we could reduce our fructose intake, it would have a HUGE effect. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done b/c sugar and high fructose corn syrup are in almost everything (especially processed foods). 2 | Secondly, be careful with other things that are used to MAKE fructose. We can make fructose from a high salt diet. We can make fructose if we get dehydrated. High uric acid stimulates fructose production. And in all these situations, we’re MAKING fructose from glucose. The glucose-to-fructose conversion. If you give high amounts of glucose to an animal… as the glucose hits the liver it induces an enzyme called aldose reductase which converts glucose to fructose. Rick’s experiment showed that when feeding mice high glucose it can convert to fructose endogenously. Does this suggest that you get fatty liver from excess glucose even if it’s not high in sugar? Yeah, absolutely, if you have that enzyme induced.",

  "content": "Normally, you could reverse the induction of this aldose reductase enzyme within a few weeks by restricting sugar…but once your uric acid goes up that will keep it elevated (regardless of sugar intake). Another reason potentially to use allopurinol in addition to fructose restriction to keep uric acid low and mitigate the induction of aldose reductase. A high starch diet becomes a much bigger problem AFTER you get metabolic syndrome. Because once you have metabolic syndrome…Let’s say you stop eating sugar but you continue to eat carbs. The carbs are going to continue to activate through the same pathway. This is why a low carb diet is really great for metabolically ill people.",

If you genetically knock out the sweet taste buds in animals…They still like sugar and they will still eat a lot of it. But they won’t like artificial sugar. In other words, the artificial sugar is driven by the sweet taste but what makes animals like real sugar is through its metabolism. So even though but artificial and real sugar have the sweet taste and the dopamine response, the real sugar gives us some pleasure in the periphery where the metabolism takes place. Animals will tend to eat a little bit less sugar when their taste buds are gone, but they still eat enough to develop metabolic syndrome.",
