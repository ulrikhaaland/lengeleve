  "content": "Cortisol is a hormone that plays a significant role in metabolism. It's easy to demonize cortisol, much in the same way we are naively prone to do with insulin (i.e., high = bad; low = good). It’s important to remember context before we do so. Elevated cortisol can help save our life in fight-or-flight situations or it can contribute to chronic disease. Cortisol and insulin appear to play opposing roles acutely. Insulin is a depositing (anabolic) hormone and cortisol is a mobilizing (catabolic) hormone. Cushing syndrome is a condition where a person is faced with continuous and excessive cortisol production. One of the hallmarks of Cushing syndrome is excessive fat accumulation and extreme muscle wasting of the extremities. In the case of Addison’s Disease, where cortisol levels can drop to very low levels, it is characterized by weight loss. Cortisol appears to simultaneously stimulate fat deposition and fat mobilization and it can induce or exacerbate insulin resistance.",

  "content": "The interplay between nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress, and glucocorticoids can provide many insights into health and metabolism. What happens to cortisol in the body may depend on what’s happening with insulin, and vice versa, along with other important fat cell hormones and enzymes, such as hormone-sensitive lipase.",
