  "content": "Cortisol and insulin play opposing roles acutely. Cortisol is a mobilizing (catabolic) hormone and insulin is a depositing (anabolic) hormone. Cortisol appears to simultaneously stimulate fat deposition and fat mobilization and it can induce or exacerbate insulin resistance. What happens to cortisol in the body may depend on whatâ€™s happening with insulin, and vice versa, along with other important fat cell hormones and enzymes.",

One of the things he wants to put an emphasis on is not just the best clips from a particular episode, but the best topics, which are often covered in several different episodes. Using cortisol as an example, some of the guests that have talked about the hormone and its effects on health include Matthew Walker, Robert Sapolsky, Jason Fung, Nav Chandel, and Robert Lustig.",
