  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Cholesterol, like all lipids, is not soluble in water and can only circulate in plasma in protein-cased macromolecular particles called lipoproteins. Of the two main classes of lipoproteins, only those enwrapped by a single molecule of the protein apoB – 90-95% of which are low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) – have the ability to enter arteries and initiate atherogenesis. Thus, over the last 50 years or so, pharmaceutical companies have developed many treatments for lowering LDL-C and apoB with the goal of reducing CV events and mortality, but this has led many to question whether low LDL-C might have negative repercussions for areas of the body that rely heavily on cholesterol for normal functioning.",

  "title": "PCSK9 inhibitors and their role",
  "date": "February 5, 2022",
  "context": "Cholesterol",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "One therapeutic strategy for enhancing LDL clearance is thus inhibition of PCSK9. By blocking PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation, more LDLR remains available to return to the cell surface and rebind LDL, clearing more particles from circulation. There are two classes of PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) now available: (1) antibodies (alirocumab and evolocumab) that bind to PCSK9 and prevent it from interacting with LDLR; and (2) a novel, liver-selective, short-chain, synthetic siRNA called inclisiran, which inhibits the expression of the PCSK9 gene and thus production of PCSK9 protein.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The most cholesterol-rich tissue in the human body is the central nervous system (CNS), which, though it accounts for only ~2% of the body’s total mass, contains roughly a quarter of its total unesterified cholesterol. Most is present in myelin – the axon-insulating sheath that increases the speed of signal transmission between neurons – while the rest is found in cell membranes, where it affects neuron shape and plays a vital role in synaptic transmission.",

  "context": "Cholesterol",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Does lowering circulating LDL-C with PCSK9i have similar detrimental cognitive effects? As I discussed in my original post, mounting evidence indicates that the answer is no. In separate randomized controlled trials for alirocumab and evolocumab, both drugs were found to yield significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and total serum cholesterol than placebo treatment among high CV-risk adult subjects. Treatment vs. placebo groups exhibited no significant differences in neurocognition across any of the CANTAB modules.",

  "content": "Subjects aged 10-17 with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) were treated with either placebo or the PCSK9i evolocumab for 24 weeks, after which they were tested for cognitive function in four domains: psychomotor function, attention, executive function, and visual learning. As seen in adult trials, evolocumab treatment did not result in cognitive decline relative to either baseline measurements or to the placebo group in any of the domains tested.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The findings of these studies collectively suggest that LDL-C can be reduced even to very low levels without impacting the brain, but how is this possible when we know that cholesterol is so critical for neural development and function? The reason is simple: why import what you can make yourself? Virtually every nucleated cell in the body is capable of synthesizing cholesterol, and the brain is no exception. In the CNS, cholesterol production exceeds demand, and net cholesterol flux is thus outward from the CNS across the blood-brain barrier.",

  "content": "While these recent studies have focused specifically on cognitive effects of the PCSK9i class of LDL-lowering drugs, there is likewise no evidence to suggest that other classes of lipid medications have any harmful effects on the brain. Existing data indicate that statins, for example, do not increase risk of cognitive impairment.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "With respect to pediatric patients, it’s worth noting that most neural development occurs very early in childhood, whereas the HAUSER-RCT investigated effects only during adolescence. However, pharmacological LDL-lowering interventions are generally not recommended for children under the age of 8 except in very rare, extreme cases such as homozygous FH, when LDL concentrations exceed 500 mg/dL and patients are at risk of childhood myocardial infarction.",

So when it comes to lowering circulating LDL in an effort to improve cardiovascular health for ourselves or our children, we can feel assured that it won’t come at an expense to the brain.",
