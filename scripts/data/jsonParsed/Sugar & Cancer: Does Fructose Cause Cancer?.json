  "content": "Rick Johnson and Lew Cantley have both spoken about non-insulin requiring nutrients such as fructose. A review from 2020 by Johnson et al., suggests that Fructose contributes to the Warburg effect for cancer growth. Recent work by Cantley’s lab and Richard Johnson’s lab showed that fructose seems to drive certain cancers, particularly colon cancer. A study published in Science in 2020, found that High-fructose corn syrup enhances intestinal tumor growth in mice. Fructose turns on the Warburg effect, allows ATP to go down, and allows glucose to flow in. This occurs independently of the effect of insulin.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "When fructose is consumed in excess, fructose metabolism leads to insulin resistance, which leads to hyperinsulinemia. The Colon cancer work by Lew Cantley suggests that it’s an energetic issue, the lowering of ATP in the cell that occurs when fructose is metabolized that can drive hyper-influx of glucose. This is not necessarily an insulin-driven process.",
