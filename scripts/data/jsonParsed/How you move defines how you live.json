One without the other—long lifespan with poor healthspan or short lifespan with rich healthspan—isn’t what most people want.",

  "content": "Lifespan, at the first order, is driven by how long one can delay the onset of atherosclerotic disease (CHD, CVA), cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. Delay the onset of these, and you live longer. Healthspan, in its most distilled form, is about preserving three elements of life as long as possible: Brain—namely, how long can you preserve cognition (i.e., executive function, processing speed, short-term memory), Body—specifically, how long can you maintain muscle mass, functional movement and strength, flexibility, and freedom from pain, and 'Spirit'—how robust is your social support network and your sense of purpose.",

Some of the interventions that can make you live longer and live better will find their foundation in understanding evolutionary biology.",

The hack can be elegant, the hack can be cumbersome, but its purpose is the same—something is getting in the way of a desired outcome and we need a workaround.",

  "content": "What we actually need are examples of how real people can be empowered to preserve muscle mass, move functionally, maintain freedom from pain, and be the best athletes of their lives. An 'athlete-of-life' can hip-hinge, squat, carry, shift, push, pull, rotate, and anti-rotate with confidence and fluidity. On a deeper level, one should also re-connect to their childhood movement patterns, before the toll of life and technology wreaked havoc. We need to re-learn how to roll, crawl, and hang, which are patterns that can release the 'brakes' from our everyday movement that sabotage strength and lead to pain and injury.",
