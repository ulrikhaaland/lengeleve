  "content": "During military operations, individuals can experience sustained periods of strenuous effort alongside a relative scarcity of food intake. One of the major concerns of such exposure is the associated loss of lean body mass (LBM) and muscle function. Similarly, one of the potential drawbacks of severe caloric restriction (CR), and fasting, as health-promoting tactics are the loss of LBM and muscle function that can accompany them.",

  "date": "August 25, 2019",
  "context": "Fasting",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Essentially, the investigators were wondering: if we give supplemental testosterone to young and healthy men undergoing a month-long severe energy-deficit, can it preserve LBM and muscle function (as measured by isometric and isokinetic knee extension tests)? The hypothesis was that, yes, the group receiving testosterone would lose less LBM, lose more fat mass (FM), and lessen lower-body muscle functional decline compared to a placebo group.",

  "date": "August 25, 2019",
  "context": "Fasting",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The testosterone group actually gained close to 6 lb of LBM over 28 days, while losing about 11 lb of FM, on average. However, these changes did not translate into any improvements in muscle function. In fact, their muscle function declined just as much as the placebo group. All of this is very interesting, but what I find much more interesting in this study is that the placebo group did not lose any substantive LBM, while losing about the same amount of fat (10 lb) as the testosterone group, despite the severe CR/energy-deficit.",
