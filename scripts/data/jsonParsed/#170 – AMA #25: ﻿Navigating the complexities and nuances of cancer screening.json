  "content": "Cancer screening is important as it helps in early detection of cancer, making it easier to treat. The evidence suggests that a cancer that is caught earlier is easier to treat than a cancer that is caught later. For instance, if you catch a breast cancer or a colon cancer when there are tens or hundreds of millions of cancer cells, your odds of treating that successfully are better than if you catch the same cancer years later, when there are billions of cells. The more we can do to screen for cancer and catch it earlier, the better we will be.",

A sensitive test is likely to detect a person who has the condition if they’re tested. Specificity, on the other hand, is the probability that a bunch of people who do not have the condition will also end up with a negative test. False positives and false negatives are potential outcomes of these tests.",

This method minimizes radiation because the mammography is very low radiation. Diffusion-weighted imaging with background subtraction can pick up things that no other test can pick up. However, diffusion-weighted imaging misses something that mammograms pick up— small calcified lesions. If you have dense breast tissue, if you have glandular breast tissue, you’re going to get a lot of false positives. That’s why ultrasound or MRI as a backup is a great way to avoid the unnecessary biopsies that plagued many women for decades.",
