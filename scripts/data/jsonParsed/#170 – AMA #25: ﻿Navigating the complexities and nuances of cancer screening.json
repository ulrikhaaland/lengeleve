  "content": "Addressing the first question: How do you think about cancer screening? Longevity has these two components—they’re not independent—but sometimes, it’s helpful to think about them in isolation: Lifespan—How do you live longer? Healthspan—How do you live better? Major diseases that rob a person of lifespan include cancer, atherosclerotic diseases, and the diseases of dementia and neurocognitive decline The latter two go more hand in hand with the reduction in health span By definition, when a person has Alzheimer’s disease, their quality of life  i.e. their cognition) is also deteriorating–So they’re experiencing both the slide in quality of life and eventually length of life Similarly in people that have advanced atherosclerosis, a lot of times the reduction in the ability to carry out activities of daily living kind of moves more hand in hand with that In the case of cancer, health span decline is a little less the case Age is the greatest risk factor for cancer just as it is for the other two diseases But in some ways it’s a little bit easier to think of cancer in isolation from the health span stuff if you’re trying to imagine a world in which you can live longer… that means living in a world where we delay the onset of chronic disease and/or have better tools to live longer with chronic disease Peter much more favors the former option (i.e., delay) because we’ve basically spent most of the history of modern medicine working on the latter option with very, very limited success. Screening One of the pillars of longevity is minimizing mortality from cancer So where does screening fit into this? Screening is one of three pieces First piece would be, how do you prevent cancer? The second thing would be, how do you screen for cancer and detect it early? And the third is, how do you treat it when you have it? Focusing on the prevention piece…",

  "title": "Why screening is important",
  "date": "July 26, 2021",
  "context": "Cancer",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The simplest explanation for why screening matters is the evidence that suggests that a cancer that is caught earlier is easier to treat than a cancer that is caught later. For instance, if you catch a breast cancer or a colon cancer when there are tens or hundreds of millions of cancer cells, your odds of treating that successfully are better than if you catch the same cancer years later, when there are billions of cells. The evidence for that basically comes from examining how patients respond to the exact same drugs in the adjuvant setting versus in the metastatic setting. One explanation for that may be that the cancers that have been around longer have developed more mutations. It is therefore Peter’s belief that the more we can do to screen for cancer and catch it earlier, the better we will be.",

Well, the prevalence is 1% and the positive predictive value is 10%—That’s actually pretty good as far as a test goes. Today’s mammography is going to have a higher sensitivity and specificity.

  "content": "Methyl groups are those little CH groups that are ubiquitous in all of biochemistry and when they get attached to DNA/get attached to the nucleotides it’s like fingerprints, like knowing that there’s a change in the signature of what’s going on. It’s that CF or cell-free DNA methylation pattern that is what allows people to in the case of these machine learning algorithms infer that a cancer is present AND what the likely tissue of origin is. Originally, there was another hypothesis was that you could look for tumor DNA. But it turns out that this cell-free DNA approach is the more robust approach because it’s simply a numbers game. While there is some DNA from tumors, it’s far less common. The actual amount of it is about 1/1000th the amount of cell-free DNA. In other words, you’ve got about 0.1% the amount of tumor DNA that you have cell-free DNA so you’d be better off looking at the cell-free DNA and looking at the methylation patterns of that than trying to find the tumor DNA. This kind of epigenetic screening is basically what allows you to infer what’s going on at the level of the tissue. You validate using known positive and known negatives. You look at blood banks in which you have a whole bunch of people who have a known type of cancer. And then you have blood from people who are known to not have cancer and not develop cancer in the next period of X months or years. Then the question is, Can you take that information of something that you calibrate on known positives and negatives, and then apply it to what we call real-world performance? The answer is yes. Preliminarily, what we know is that the test increases in sensitivity as cancer stages goes up. The specificity on this test is very high – about 99.5%. But the sensitivity starts low. stage one cancers – about 20%. stage two cancers – about 45%. Stage three cancers – about 81%. Stage four cancers – about 93%. For all local cancers—stage one, two, and three—it’s a 44% sensitivity. For all cancers all told, it’s about a 55% sensitivity, 99.3% specificity. Predictive value: If you apply those data to an all-comer prevalence, you’ll see that the positive predictive value for early stage tumors is about 20%. And it increases to about 45% for all cancers, and 55-60% for advanced cancers. Negative predictive value vacillates between 99.2 and 99.9%. The most remarkable thing about liquid biopsies… It’s testing for more or less 50 cancer types and it’s really good at discerning what they call the tissue of origin—96% of the samples can actually detect which location it’s coming from. So rather than going through the multitude of invasive tests (CT scan, biopsy, colonoscopy) in search of the origin, you can know this from the liquid biopsy. Blind spots of liquid biopsies (and other tests) With mammography, there are huge blind spots when it comes to very dense glandular breast tissue. Huge blind spot to MRI, small calcified lesion. There’s a blind spot to liquid biopsies, tissues that are encapsulated. Prostate, for example—liquid biopsies are not a great test for prostate cancer.",

It always goes from polyp to cancer. Not all of those polyps are pedunculated, meaning they’re not all the little polyps that stick out that are easy to see. There are also sessile polyps, which are flat and easy to miss. A great endoscopist and an exceptional bowel prep should be able to identify all polyps, especially if the endoscopist is able to spend enough time looking and get complete visualization of the entire colon. If you were to do a colonoscopy on a person every single day, you would by definition always see the thing that is going to become colon cancer. That means nobody should ever be dying of colon cancer if we’re smart enough to know how often to do that test. A common recommendations today says somewhere between every 5 and 10 years, starting between age 40 and 50 depending on your risk factors. But, at the individual level, those recommendations don’t make any sense.
