  "content": "Cancer is both a genetic and metabolic disease. So by definition cancer cells have mutated and they sort of have this trait that is common to all cancers. The essential condition of cancer is unregulated/dysregulated cell growth ⇒ cells that grow without responding to normal cell cycle signaling. There’s a strong immune component to cancer because our immune system is almost always keeping cancer at check and keeping it at bay … So at some point when our immune system starts to lose that battle, that’s when cancer starts to win.",

  "content": "After smoking, obesity is the next leading predictor of cancer. Why? Peter thinks it’s less about the obesity and more about the metabolic environment that accompanies obesity, i.e. hyperinsulinemia. There’s no question that this is a disease that’s heavily impacted by the underlying metabolic health of the individual, the immune function of the individual, and the ability to acquire mutations and repair them. However, the metabolic piece is pretty much the only one we can glean anything about from a standard blood test. Glucose and insulin. Insulin primarily being the biggest because it’s a very potent and anabolic growth factor. Insulin, IGF, IGF binding proteins, all of these things factor into cancer. Glucose is the preferred fuel of cancer. Most cancers do not arise from inherited genes (maybe 5% do). The majority of cancer result from somatic mutations (mutations that occur to your genes but they’re not necessarily the genes you pass on).",
