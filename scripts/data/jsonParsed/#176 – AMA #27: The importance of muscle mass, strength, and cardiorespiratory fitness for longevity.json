  "content": "VO2 max and its association with cardiorespiratory fitness. Does better cardiorespiratory fitness lead to less mortality and does lower cardiorespiratory fitness lead to higher mortality? Or is it at least associated? Most common thing in the literature is either METs, metabolic equivalents or VO2 max. For a VO2 max test, you are hooked up to an indirect calorimeter—a device that provides complete occlusion around your mouth and your nose so you’re only breathing through your mouth. The device has two sensors on it. One sensor measures the concentration of oxygen that is being expelled. The other one is also measuring the concentration of carbon dioxide that’s expelled. Because we know the concentration of oxygen and CO2 on the way in, by knowing what comes out and obviously oxygen will be lower, CO2 will be higher, we know how much carbon dioxide was produced and how much oxygen was consumed. Knowing those two things gives you a “flow rate” — VO2 and a VCO2. This can tell you how much energy you’re utilizing via something called the Fick principle. Total energy consumption is ~3.94 times VO2, and ~1.11 times VCO2 at any point in time. For instance, for this minute VO2 was X, VCO2 was Y, then you apply it to that equation and it will tell you that you were utilizing, say, 10 kilocalories per minute which would be 600 kilocalories per hour. During zone 2 exercise, it tends to be about 780 kilocalories per hour. But now what we’re talking about is something different which is… what is the maximum utilization of oxygen? If you make somebody work harder and harder and harder, at some point they will reach a maximum at which point, they can no longer utilize more oxygen.",

Now the question is, how much of a hit are you taking to muscle size versus muscle strength? Everyone needs to be thoughtful about how they use fasting as a tool. Some patients should never be fasting.",

However, other people need the metabolic benefits of fasting, such as improvements in insulin sensitivity, glucose regulation, and other cardio-metabolic parameters. Fasting can be a useful tool for weight loss, but it's important to understand that muscle mass may also be reduced in the process. A one-size-fits-all approach is not suitable, and it's important to evaluate the situation in the context of individual health status. Anyone close to sarcopenia should not be fasting or in a calorie-restricted state.",

Contrary to popular belief, the decline in muscle mass or size as we age is not linear or gradual, but rather staggered, especially in cases of injury or bedridden conditions. Having a muscle reserve is important for times of disease or injury. Waiting until older age to start building muscle could potentially be disastrous.",

Regular exercise is crucial, and it's important to find a way to enjoy it as it needs to be done every day.",
