A rapid increase in morbidity and mortality risk as fitness levels decline with age is shown in the literature. The relative contributions of CRF, muscle mass, and strength are also examined. The impact of fasting on muscle mass, the potential tradeoffs to consider, and the critical importance of working to maintain muscle mass and strength as we age are also discussed.",

Aging can lead to low-grade inflammation, oxidative stress, impaired regenerative capacity, and impaired muscle protein synthesis. This results in the replacement of Type II muscle fibers with fat and connective tissue, leading to insulin resistance, less glucose disposal, and a greater tendency to diabetes.",

But when you take that normalized unit of strength per CT area and you reduce that by 0.2 units, or DEXA reduced by 0.34 units, you are seeing an increase of 26% or a 39% increase in mortality, respectively. With reduction in grip strength, which was normalized by DEXA arm measurement, it’s at 23%. And all of these were statistically significant.",
