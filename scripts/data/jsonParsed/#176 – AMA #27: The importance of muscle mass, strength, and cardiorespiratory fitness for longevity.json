The device has two sensors on it. One sensor measures the concentration of oxygen that is being expelled. The other one is also measuring the concentration of carbon dioxide that’s expelled. Knowing those two things gives you a “flow rate” — VO2 and a VCO2. This can tell you how much energy you’re utilizing via something called the Fick principle. But now what we’re talking about is something different which is… what is the maximum utilization of oxygen?",
