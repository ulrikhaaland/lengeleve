  "content": "Cardiovascular disease: how early and aggressive lowering of apoB could change the course of ASCVD. The leading causes or modifiable causes of ASCVD are smoking, hypertension, and hyperbetalipoproteinemia. Measuring ApoB is preferred over just measuring LP, LDL, particle number, or LDL cholesterol number because it captures the total concentration of ApoB. The question becomes: 'When should you start ApoB reduction and how much should you lower it?'",

  "content": "If you pharmacologically lower ApoB to somewhere in the 20 to 30 milligram per deciliter range for everybody in the population while someone is in their 20s, you can potentially eliminate ASCVD. This would essentially eliminate death from atherosclerotic causes. By the time you’re in your late 30s or early 40s, if you have any measure of ApoB that’s even north of the 20th percentile, that should be completely lowered.",

  "content": "When you look at a lot of the Mendelian randomizations plus the clinical trial data, if you have an LDL cholesterol below 30 or an ApoB below 40 milligrams per deciliter for a very long period of time, the odds that you’re going to suffer for ASCVD are incredibly low. The earlier you start and the lower you go the more you can make that number approximate zero. It then only becomes a question of: What are your therapeutic choices to get there? And how do you do this in a way that minimizes the side effects of that?",

  "content": "For some people to lower ApoB that much is trivial — some take a PCSK9 inhibitor and a statin and can basically eradicate it. But for some people, statins are difficult to tolerate. About 5% of the population has intractable muscle soreness and that appears to be the case regardless of which statin you use. If they’re a hyper absorber we would use ezetimibe, if they’re a hyper synthesizer, but can’t respond to statins, we use mefenamic acid.",
