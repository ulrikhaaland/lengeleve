Peter suggests thinking of the diaphragm like a cylinder. The strongest cylinder would have a big top, a big bottom, and symmetrical sides. The diaphragm is like the top of that cylinder. The bottom of the cylinder is the pelvic floor, whose musculature will coordinate the regulation of intra-abdominal pressure that is created with the descending of the diaphragm. Besides respiration, the diaphragm has a postural function. Creates intra-abdominal pressure and the pelvic floor is active and stretches (eccentric loading). Abdominal wall musculature: rectus abdominis (six-pack muscles), oblique musculature that crosses the body, comes up and attaches to the rib cage, Transverse abdominis: wraps around from the back. Diaphragm descends, performs a stabilization function, creates intra-abdominal pressure that musculature reacts to. Eccentric contraction followed by an isometric contraction. But body must coordinate between the respiratory and postural functions. CNS needs to generate enough pressure to maintain stability but also allow the diaphragm to descend enough for lungs to expand. If this coordination is not working well, see overutilization / lower crossed syndrome and lose deep stabilization. Brain uses compensatory pattern to maintain stability.",

Eccentrically loaded: when a muscle is getting longer as it’s being loaded. When training, most people tend to emphasize the concentric and don’t realize the eccentric. Too much emphasis on the eccentric will create more hypertrophy. But with, for example, hip abduction, eccentric control is a very important part of injury prevention. What these pioneers (Vojta, Janda, Lewit, Kolář) noticed was the importance of training that central nervous system to optimize stabilization, stereotype, and synergy. Then get what Kolář calls centration throughout that chain of movement / kinematic chain. For example, good hip joint stability requires a nice interplay between agonist and antagonist, between concentric and eccentric activity. Need to maintain an ideal position of the femur and the acetabulum for full range of motion. If that is compromised throughout any part of that kinematic chain, it’s going to affect the quality of centration (transfer of force) and load above and below that region.",

Can be modified if have pain or need to gradually work up to it. With consistency and repetition, develop a motor engram and becomes the default. In reverse it’s eccentric stretching of glutes and leg muscles. Not the same as a “shin box” stretch – it’s not “crunching your cylinder” but instead bending and folding at the waist.",

Only use as much weight as allows you to still maintain your functional threshold, ideal centration and stabilization. Provides a challenge which reinforces the pattern. Can then integrate it into other sports.",
