  "content": "Blue blocker glasses can improve sleep quality. Sleep is a balancing act between adenosine, cortisol, and melatonin. Adenosine builds up with the more energy you expend. Cortisol should be low in the evenings and melatonin should rise at night. Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland in the absence of light, specifically blue light. Therefore, blocking blue light can help improve sleep.",

  "content": "To minimize jet lag and sleep disruption while traveling, it is recommended to immediately 'put yourself' in the destination time zone when you leave the place of origin. This can involve sleeping for a certain number of hours on the plane and staying up until a normal bedtime on destination time. It can also involve waking up early and going to bed earlier in the days before the trip, getting exercise, and avoiding caffeine on the day of the trip. Supplements such as phosphatidylserine and sleep remedies can be used to help induce sleep, and modafinil can be used to help stay awake upon arrival.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "PMS is not 'made up' and is a legitimate response to a hormone issue. It is likely that in some women, progesterone withdrawal during the last part of the luteal phase is the problem. The female hormone cycle consists of two phases: the follicular phase, where the body prepares for the follicle to be secreted, and the luteal phase, where the endometrial lining prepares for a fertilized egg. Progesterone is the hormone that really matters here. It, along with estrogen, starts very low during the period. Estrogen peaks during ovulation, then goes down but has a second peak in the mid-follicular phase, then comes back down again.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Progesterone stays really low throughout follicular phase and does not start to rise until after ovulation when it prepares the endometrium. It then comes crashing down at the end but from a much higher peak because it rises much higher during the luteal phase. Due to the very rapid withdrawal of progesterone, some women experience symptoms of emotional lability, mood swings which typically goes away once her period arrives. People have suspected that there are different degrees of progesterone receptors centrally that may be part of why this is happening.",

  "content": "Interventions include better sleep, exercise, nutrition, time with friends. Pharmacological interventions include a very low dose of progesterone for women to take orally following ovulation, between 25 and 50 milligrams, which usually blunts all of the symptoms out. The drawback is that the woman has to closely monitor her cycle and time the dosage accurately for it to work. Another option is oral contraceptives which takes all of this fluctuation away and normalizes it but comes with its own pros and cons.",
