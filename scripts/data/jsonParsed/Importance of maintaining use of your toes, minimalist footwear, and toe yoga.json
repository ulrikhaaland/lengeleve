This basically involves spreading the toes apart and moving the big toe and other toes up and down independently of each other, all while keeping the rest of the foot relatively still.",

Modern shoes often squeeze your toes and minimize the use of your toes therefore your body becomes accustomed to not needing them. People don’t think about their toes and their feet until there’s a problem. Above your waist is two-thirds of your mass. They’re basically supporting that mass all the time and pushing you through space.",
