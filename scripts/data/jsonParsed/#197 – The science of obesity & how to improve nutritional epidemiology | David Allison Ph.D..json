Fenfluramine is a selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitor, which originally was used for depression and people realized sometimes those drugs (SSRIs) cause weight loss. However, fen-phen was found to produce a certain valvulopathy and further investigation made it clear it was the fenfluramine component, not the phentermine component that did that.
