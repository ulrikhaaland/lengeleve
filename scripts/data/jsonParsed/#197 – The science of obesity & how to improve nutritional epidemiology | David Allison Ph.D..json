David’s research interests include obesity and nutrition, quantitative genetics, clinical trials, statistical and research methodology, and research rigor and integrity.

Rearing of the home does have an influence, but it’s not huge. Peter notes, this is “an incredible degree of concordance”.",

The endocrine system is relatively straightforward to understand. Most of the focus was on developing tools to help people reduce energy intake. This is still the case today. Surgery and drugs mostly help people reduce calorie intake. Behavioral therapy began to be used in the ‘60’s. Stewart began thinking about using behavioral therapy to treat obesity. It has continued to get better and better since then. David’s sense is that we have been asymptoting for a long time. We’re getting incrementally better but not meaningfully better with many of the behavioral/cognitive things. In the early 90’s he was a postdoc at the New York Obesity Research Center. At this time a few people started using pharmaceuticals to treat obesity. Fen-phen is a drug that came up and caught people’s attention. We now know it’s dangerous and it’s gone. Fen-phen is a nickname for two drugs used in combination, phentermine and fenfluramine. Phentermine is a drug that was and still is approved by the FDA for the treatment of obesity. Though it’s never been approved for long-term. This goes back a long way, it’s a catecholaminergic agonist. It’s a relatively safe drug; no drug is perfectly safe.",

There were many unscrupulous medical providers who did provided it in ways they shouldn’t have. But there were many scrupulous medical providers who used it carefully and thoughtfully, and it did seem to have much better benefit than other people had predicted before. Then a very young, smart pathologist at the Mayo Clinic began noticing peculiar valvulopathy on autopsies. This was not a common thing. What they shared in common was the patients had been on fen-phen. This began the investigation into fen-phen. People quickly realized that fen-phen did produce a certain valvulopathy and further investigation made it clear it was the fenfluramine component, not the phentermine component that did that. So fenfluramine was withdrawn. Many drugs in the history of obesity hurt people; but what was good about this is prompted people to think more about obesity as a serious medical disorder.",

How do we reconcile, one, the potential confounders of that type of an analysis with this layer of granularity in the data that looks at adiposity versus lean mass? David notes this is the challenge of observational research in general. There are no simple solutions to it, other than trying to triangulate on the answer with multiple studies. What we really want are pure, randomized experiments in humans. With large samples and perfect compliance for many years. And we want to randomly assign people to be obese or not obese. Obviously, we can’t do that. What we have is  observational epidemiology. There are randomized trials where people lose weight. There are non-randomized trials, like Sjostrom’s with surgery. There are mouse studies. David includes them in his analysis. What they’ve shown is that throwing out subjects who die early in the analysis doesn’t help, or it doesn’t reliably help.

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "\"The narratives we have about obesity, including about ethnicity and obesity, are grossly oversimplified\" – David Allison. So we often hear, “Obesity’s selectively a disease of the poor and uneducated”. In this country, it’s often stated, “Minority status leads to less income, less education, which in turn, leads to poorer access to healthcare, poorer habits, poorer living environments, which leads to poor health and reduced longevity”. And there’s probably some truth to that, but it’s not 1 to 1; it’s not simple. For example, when we hear that there’s this inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and obesity, this varies depending on ethnicity. We hear this over and over again. It was first shown by Mickey Stunkard, again, in the 1950s, in the Midtown Manhattan Project. It’s reliably true in adult white women. When you go outside the group of adult white women, it’s not always true. If you go to African American women, there is virtually no association between socioeconomic status and obesity. When you go to African American men and look at their obesity levels, they’re very similar to the obesity levels of European American men, white American men. But if you look at African American women’s obesity levels, and you compare it to European or white American women, it’s much higher. If you bring Hispanic Americans in, both men and women have higher levels of obesity, than do European American men and women. So in Hispanic Americans, there is an ethnicity difference (but not by gender). In African Americans, there is a gender by ethnicity difference. When you look at mortality, the African American curves follow similarly, but not identically, to the European American curves. But in Hispanic Americans, David’s research can’t find an association between BMI and longevity in this group. This is true across all BMIs. The data sets they have are not perfect; the follow-ups may not be long enough, the sample sizes may not be big enough. He’s not saying it’s causal, he’s only explaining what they observed in publicly available datasets of Hispanic Americans. Analysis of BMI and longevity could not show an association between elevated BMI and mortality in Hispanic Americans.",

For example, build a restaurant in 1 town but not another. This is the realm of Bethany Bell, she looks at food deserts and things. Built a grocery store where there was a food desert and we’re told that food deserts are a problem, but it doesn’t look like things got better when we built the grocery store.
