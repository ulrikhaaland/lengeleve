  "content": "Alcohol consumption can negatively impact sleep quality and stress levels. Using sleep tracking devices, it has been observed that sleep quality suffers if more than one drink is consumed too close to bedtime. This can result in decreased heart rate variability, increased resting heart rate, increased respiratory rate, and increased core body temperature. Alcohol also disproportionately negatively impacts REM sleep, which can lead to increased anxiety.",

  "title": "How Alcohol Disrupts Sleep",
  "date": "March 30, 2022",
  "context": "Alcohol & Sleep",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Alcohol disrupts sleep in several ways. Firstly, it acts as a sedative, causing you to lose consciousness faster but preventing naturalistic sleep. Secondly, it can cause sleep to become more fragmented by stimulating the fight or flight branch of the nervous system, causing you to wake up more frequently throughout the night. Lastly, alcohol decreases the amount of REM sleep you get, which can lead to increased stress and anxiety.",

  "context": "Alcohol & Sleep",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The impact of alcohol on sleep can vary between individuals due to genetic differences. Some people are fast metabolizers of alcohol and can therefore experience less disruption to their REM sleep even after consuming alcohol. However, others may experience significant disruption to their REM sleep even after consuming just one drink.",
