They also talk about the significance of ApoE genotype and compare the various forms of dementia including differentiating between Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy body dementia. They discuss the current landscape of clinical trials, the drug pipeline, and talk about a very promising monoclonal antibody directed at amyloid beta that has the potential to be a disease-modifying drug.",

There are orphan diseases for which we have no drugs, but “there have been a few shots on goal”. But the ratio of shots on goal to goals is lower in Alzheimer’s disease than any other disease. On one level, it’s related to the complexity of the disease. On another level, we may have targeted the wrong goal, too late in the game, the wrong angle, etc.",

N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, e.g., memantine, normalizes levels of glutamate, helping with neurotransmission. Behavioral drugs target specific problems like apathy, agitation, psychosis, sometimes sleep issues, and sometimes appetite and eating problems. Disease modifying treatments actually target the underlying pathology, monoclonal antibodies against primarily amyloid are the biggest group of those that are in trials right now [1:18:15].

  "content": "Amyloid-β is made at different points along the cascade. The amyloid precursor protein is on Chromosome 21, this is why people with Down syndrome (who have three copies of Chromosome 21) almost inevitably will get Alzheimer’s if they live long enough, they’re making a third more amyloid than the rest of us. But amyloid-β can be made anywhere from the very beginning of our DNA all the way through some of the enzymes that cleave amyloid. The amyloid gets cleaved at the length of 40 or 42 amino acids rather than the regular length. Then the abnormal amyloid folds and there are five rolls, the plaque itself is a conglomeration of a series of folds in the protein. There are even differences among the antibodies as to what part of that cascade they target. Normal amyloid is a component of blood vessel walls. The pathologic amyloid with abnormal lengths of amyloid-β 40 and 42 could be removed with no ill effects because they have no legit function in the body, researchers are targeting the enzymes that abnormally cleave amyloid as a potential treatment, both gamma secretase inhibitors and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitors have been studied, but side effects have been an issue. Peter wonders if there has been research on using an antisense oligonucleotide to target enzyme transcription with laser precision. Amanda notes that the downstream effects of various potential treatments are often unknown, might cause liver toxicity or cardiac arrhythmias or something else that makes the drug unsafe. There are five approved drugs for Alzheimer’s disease right now and a sixth that is a combination of two others.",

Some earlier drug trials may have been unsuccessful because they targeted amyloid too late. An understanding of the progression through preclinical Alzheimer’s and mild clinical impairment (MCI) allowed us to then design currently ongoing trials looking at prevention by amyloid removal both before cognitive symptoms start and during the MCI period. Earlier failed studies lasted about 18 months. For Alzheimer’s, 18 months is a spot where progress would be very significant, staying stable would be an improvement, and getting worse means the drug is not working.",

  "content": "Another issue is that the primary outcome measures for these trials aren’t very good. Some use the clinical dementia rating (CDR), which has a subjective component based on patient and caretaker interviews. Prone to bias from, for example, a highly stressed or depressed caregiver who sees everything worse than it is and over-reports symptoms. CDR looks at memory, judgment, hobbies, etc., which are reported by the patient and caregiver, whose responses are compared. There is also an “intangible part” where a scorer might say it “feels like” a 1.0 or a 0.5 – this is not an objective measure like your LDL level. Peter suggests that because subjective evaluation is so important, we at least need biomarkers that are so predictive of clinical outcome that you can rely on them in combination with a clinical evaluation. You can’t do a long enough study to get hard outcomes. Two big challenges in drug development for Alzheimer’s disease technical challenge of developing a good enough drug operational challenge of how you actually study it. Can use different outcome measures like the The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) cognitive composite score have been used in other trials.",
