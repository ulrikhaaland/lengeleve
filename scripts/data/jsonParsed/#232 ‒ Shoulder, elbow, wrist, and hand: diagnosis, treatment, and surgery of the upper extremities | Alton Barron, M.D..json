There were certainly no arthroscopic repairs of the labrum except these early devices where you’d get in there, see it, and you’d just drill a little hole and mallet in this big broad tack.

You can predict this somewhat based on the age of the person, their physiology, and the mechanism of the trauma. Tears are broadly classified into degenerative tears and traumatic tears. For younger people (under 40), it’s rare for them to tear their rotator cuff. But it can happen traumatically. It’s that rare, dramatic circumstance that leads to traumatic tears in young people. The younger you are, the strong the linkage of the tendon to the bone. You often pull off some bone.

There are a lot of sports to play, and you don’t necessarily have to be butting heads at high velocity. It could be important for kids who have a lot of athletic potential, and at age 11 are going to decide what to focus on. If you knew you’d have a longer shelf life in one sport over another, that should weigh into the decision-making process. For instance, if you have super loose joints, then you’re going to need to pick the ones that you can keep dynamically stabilized but are not going to be subjected directly to unnecessary forces.",

  "content": "Pain generators in the shoulder. A type III acromion can be a pain generator. The AC joint is another one. “Almost everybody through wear and tear, middle age and beyond, has arthritis in the AC joint… it’s almost always asymptomatic, but it can be symptomatic”‒ Alton Barron. Young weightlifters can develop fluid in the end of the clavicle from repetitive use. Doing heavy bench press and other activities can result in distal clavicle osteolysis. Repetitive jamming or bruising of the bone and cartilage causes the cartilage to disintegrate and the bone to lose its integrity. It starts to get very soft and it gets very inflamed. Lat raises puts so much leverage on that joint, it just jams up. Alton does not recommend his patients do these. If you are to do it and want to minimize stress, Peter is in favor of thumbs going up (not down), and not directly laterally but more in the natural plane of the scapula. If you lie directly on the point of your shoulder and it jams that again, and causes a lot of pain there. That pain comes right down the front and kind of follows the biceps. So, you have to differentiate that between the 2. Then you look at an X-ray (without an MRI), and you see these spurs that are down there. Well, those spurs aren’t ever going to tear the rotator cuff, because that tendon is out there (to the left)‒ it never gets that far. But it rubs, and we see it as an indentation in the muscle. Every time you’re working out, you hypertrophy your muscles, so if you have that constantly rubbing there and then you hypertrophy around it, it hurts. Peter notes, “That’s an athlete who complains that when they’re lifting, it hurts more”.",

Yes, you’re shooting carbon dioxide to blow everything up. And he uses water to do the same thing, but not at high pressure (35 mmHg). It makes the capsule bigger. Lower pressure means less postoperative pain and less distention. You can still put in little retractors, kind of pull tissue out of the way and so forth. So that’s just a technique that’s more of an extension of what Alton does in the elbow. Because there’s a lot more peril because of the nerves being so close. Usually you need 2 working portals in the front. Which are just basically canals to get in with instruments, that are long enough to fit through and do the work. In the case of a superior labrum, we use a percutaneous hole right through the top, just underneath… right under where that red arrow is going (highlighted in yellow in the figure below). And that just gets you to the superior labrum. So that’s a little percutaneous, a tiny little hole in the rotator cuff muscle-tendon junction.

Stem cells were injected. The injury is gone radiographically.” We don’t have the contra positive case. Alton knows of a natural history study on asymptomatic rotator cuff tears that came out of WashU. Ken Yamaguchi was the lead on that article. They looked at ultrasounds which is great because they’re non-invasive, non-costly, and very effective if you have a good ultrasonographer. They looked at the natural history of these asymptomatic tears, and they found that they never repaired on their own. At very best, a subset of them stayed the same. The larger the tear, the more likely it was to become even larger with time. And a subset become symptomatic. None got better spontaneously. This suggests to Peter that if people are saying, “Here’s my MRI pre and post stem cells, and it got better,” that would suggest in that individual it might have worked. Alton agrees, but points out that MRIs vary significantly from machine to machine. That would have to be very well controlled. “If you showed me even 20 patients done by someone that I know is legitimate and they did that and showed comparative MRIs that even 10 out of 20 showed healing and reconstitution, man, I’d be in.” Peter hopes that study is being done. Another thing to standardize is the process of generating the stem cell. One of the challenges of doing a clinical trial is everybody has to get the same drug. How standardized is the procedure for capturing and processing stem cells? It’s non-standardized. It differs between different companies that bring the machines in.

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There are 2 pieces to it‒ the humeral side and the glenoid side. The head kind of flattens out. You have no space in there at all. You get a bone spur down here. You get some spurring around the perimeter of the glenoid, and all of that conspires to greatly diminish the motion of the shoulder and cause pain. We do these through a very small anterior incision and take down part or all or part or most of the subscapularis, the tendon in the front. We have to have a window in. Now we can work through the interval, the space between the supraspinatus and the subscapularis, but only if it’s a more limited replacement. But anyway, you take some of the humeral head off (to the right of the diagonal black line). You have a window there, you have retractors in, and you use an oscillating saw and just take that arthritic head off and all the bone spurs. Then with that space that that creates, you use another retractor, push the head, what’s left of the shaft away. And then, you get in and work on the glenoid and you ream that down to where it’s all smooth, get the bone spurs out of the perimeter, and then put in this little high density polyethylene socket (drawn in blue in part B of the figure above). This is ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (very durable). We use these little pegs by drilling holes, put in a little cement, and it’s a perfect new Teflon surface for the cobalt/ chromium (or whatever alloy it is) humeral head. The pegs are draw in black in part B of the figure above. The metal humeral head is shaded green to the right of the black diagonal line in part B of the figure. The bone has a central core and you clean that out (shaded in green to the left of the black diagonal line in part B of the figure). And this is press fit. We don’t cement these anymore, unless people have really bad bone or it’s a revision. We just press fit it into that cancellous bone and it’s super solid. The rotator cuff is still intact on top (the black line above part B of the figure), you’re working around that. Reattach the subscapularis. If you’re going to transect the subscapularis, what is the least traumatic place to do it? On the tendon, where it inserts on the bone. We leave a sleeve, so we can suture tendon to tendon. But then, we also put this heavy suture into bone. So you’ve got bone reinforcement and you’ve got tendon to tendon healing. By doing that, you also maintain the normal length. The biggest thing this person is missing is a labrum. Yes, and they don’t really need it. What stabilizes the joint? The fact that it’s arthritic, it’s already stabilized itself. Unless it’s a weird dislocating joint, which is a different entity (that you have to address that differently). For the garden variety one, they’ve already stiffened up. So what does their capsule look like when you go in, typically? It’s super thick. We resect some of it. In a good case, what is the limitation on this person, a year out from surgery? Really nothing except heavy weights. Alton doesn’t want people doing bench press or Iron Cross type things. They can throw a ball and play catch with their grandkids, for sure. They can play tennis and golf. They can shoot basketball.",

This is a constant rubbing and further degeneration of that. You get chronic pain. You can inject it with cortisone, but ultimately they can rupture depending on how much force they’re being subjected to and for how long it’s been there. Tenosynovitis is a subset of that where we have these effectively watertight tubes, on our flexor tendons (the synovium). Our body produces a little bit of lubricating fluid to keep the tendons gliding smoothly in there. It can get inflamed from overuse and the tendon becomes trapped in there and it really hurts. It can limit mobility and can even cause the tendon to lock down sometimes. He often cures this with a cortisone shot, rest, or both. A subset of them ultimately require surgery (which is very minor). This is important for hand function.",

If you take a direct blow to that knuckle and that tendon slips because you’ve disrupted some soft tissue, it can slip below the axis of rotation, then it becomes a flexor and you get a Boutonnière deformity.
