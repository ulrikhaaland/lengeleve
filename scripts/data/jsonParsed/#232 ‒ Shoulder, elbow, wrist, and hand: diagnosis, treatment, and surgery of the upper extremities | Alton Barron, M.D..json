It goes in retrogrades. So if you crack that bone in the middle (at baseline), it has very little blood supply, and you probably disrupt it.

And that was a game changer for us, especially for treating athletes. Where do you access this bone operatively? There are different schools of thought. When coming out of training, everybody made a full incision to expose everything (on the underside of the thumb near the base of the thumb and wrist). And you had jigs that you can put those screws down. Now, almost all of these are done via a small, percutaneous incision, and they’ll go either retrograde often or antegrade (working from the top side of the thumb at the base). It’s really a 3D effort to just get it in the right position. Get a central core guide wire down, and then you use a little hand drill to drill out that and then put the screw down over the wire. It’s really great because patients hardly feel that they’ve had any surgery. They heal very quickly, faster. This allows you to start movement earlier so that when it is healed, you already have your movement back so you’re not stiff and needing to do a lot of physical therapy.",
