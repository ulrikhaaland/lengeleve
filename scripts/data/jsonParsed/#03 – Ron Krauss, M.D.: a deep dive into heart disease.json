The first paper came out in 2015 (Stroes et al., 2015) on myopathy, and the second one just came out (Mach et al., 2018), and it describes the data related to diabetes, cognitive function, etc. What if statins reduce events, but not by lowering LDL? Maybe the benefits come from the endothelial health and/or inflammatory reduction? There was a trial (Ridker et al., 2017) that said we can make no change to the lipoprotein, we can reduce inflammation (in a subset of patients with an elevated CRP, using canakinumab [the CANTOS trial], a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β), and see a lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events. We may or may not see the same thing with methotrexate trial (CIRT trial) results (the study was stopped early, not based on any safety concerns) on the horizon. The JUPITER trial analyzed the associated benefit of LDL-lowering against CRP-lowering, a marker of inflammation. A potential double-whammy. Statins may have a unique ability to hit inflammation and LDL metabolism. Ron’s involvement with the last ATP panel (ATP IV), a part of the NIH, which handed it off to the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology. Why niacin has fallen out of favor, and why Ron still uses it for patients. The HDL-raising effects of niacin are not protective. That’s the conclusion to take away. HDL function. Does niacin specifically target smaller LDL particles over larger particles? Lp(a). How statins and PCSK9 inhibitors can widen the discordance between LDL-C and LDL-P, lowering medium- and larger-size LDL particles, and have less of a therapeutic effect on smaller particles, and none on the very small LDL particles.",
