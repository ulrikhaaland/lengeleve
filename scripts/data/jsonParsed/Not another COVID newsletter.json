How many took their own life by suicide or overdose? The answer here must be multiples of COVID.",

Given a sufficiently deadly pathogen, we’d vaccinate everyone at gunpoint if necessary—and we’d be right to. So, while I agree with your position on mandates, especially given the turn that Omicron has taken, I feel that we are set up to fail massively in the presence of a more dangerous pandemic.",

It must address the following questions: How effective is the vaccine at reducing the severity of the disease to the vaccinated individual? What treatment options exist for the infected? What are the consequences of infection, beyond death (that is, what is the morbidity for the survivors)? How well does the vaccine prevent transmission?",

The VA trial, despite its size, did not give enough time to see the full difference in mortality and hospitalization between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Giving enough time for every person to be exposed to COVID would be necessary before applying the ARR/NNT framework.",

The graph presented normalized death rates from each category to the death rate from COVID for each age group, but it was not meant to suggest that COVID is not a threat. Rather, it was meant to show that there are many other things that pose a greater threat to the lives and well-being of young people.",

  "content": "I generated some harsh criticism for commenting on social media and in last week’s newsletter that I felt it was wrong to remove a patient from the organ transplant list because they had not been vaccinated. Despite allegations to the contrary, I do have a sense of organ allocation, having spent many months on the transplant surgery service during my residency years at Johns Hopkins. If one argues that not being vaccinated implies poor compliance with subsequent medical care, then yes, this would rightly constitute grounds for deprioritization. If one argues that not being vaccinated increases the risk of organ rejection or subsequent infection that could lead to organ rejection (or death), then yes, this would rightly constitute grounds for deprioritization.",

  "content": "I will stipulate that the rationale included in my discussion relates to the specific context of immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients. The implications of natural immunity and vaccine requirements applied to healthy people are completely different, as I have heard you discuss recently on the podcast. I have had a lot of long and emotional discussions about this issue with our patients. While there are inconsistencies in the requirements for vaccination to be a transplant recipient (e.g., it is not required to receive an annual flu vaccine), vaccine requirements (e.g., Hepatitis B vaccination) have been in place long before the arrival of COVID. More importantly, I now see how the best outcome for a transplant patient–someone who will spend the rest of their life immunocompromised–is likely better if they are vaccinated than if they are not.",
