We have very successful treatments–both new drugs and one old drug–to treat COVID. Natural immunity is, at a minimum, as good as vaccine immunity and with each passing day the fraction of people who are not immune, via infection and/or vaccine, is shrinking precipitously. Omicron is less virulent than all variants that preceded it and will eventually infect everyone, with or without a vaccine, thereby providing an excellent booster.",

Motor vehicle-related death rates were calculated from a 12-month period ending in Q4 2019 and COVID-related death rates were calculated from a 12-month period ending in Q1 of 2021. The data for all fatality categories were further stratified by age and reported as rates per 100,000 persons within that age group.",

The best outcome for a transplant patient–someone who will spend the rest of their life immunocompromised–is likely better if they are vaccinated than if they are not.",
