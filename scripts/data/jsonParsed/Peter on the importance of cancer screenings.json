Major diseases that rob a person of lifespan include cancer, atherosclerotic diseases, and the diseases of dementia and neurocognitive decline. Age is the greatest risk factor for cancer. One of the pillars of longevity is minimizing mortality from cancer. Screening is one of three pieces: prevention, early detection, and treatment. The simplest explanation for why screening matters is the evidence that suggests that a cancer that is caught earlier is easier to treat than a cancer that is caught later. For instance, if you catch a breast cancer or a colon cancer when there are tens or hundreds of millions of cancer cells, your odds of treating that successfully are better than if you catch the same cancer years later, when there are billions of cells.",

Looking at five-year survival stats, if you catch breast cancer early and it’s a local cancer and it hasn’t metastasized, the five-year survival rates are 99%. But for metastatic breast cancer, five-year survival is about 28%.",
