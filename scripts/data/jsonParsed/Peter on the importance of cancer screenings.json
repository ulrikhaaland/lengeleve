  "content": "Major diseases that rob a person of lifespan include cancer, atherosclerotic diseases, and the diseases of dementia and neurocognitive decline. Age is the greatest risk factor for cancer just as it is for the other two diseases. The simplest explanation for why screening matters is the evidence that suggests that a cancer that is caught earlier is easier to treat than a cancer that is caught later. One explanation for that may be that the cancers that have been around longer have developed more mutations. It is therefore Peterâ€™s belief that the more we can do to screen for cancer and catch it earlier, the better we will be.",
