Early intervention means action is taken prior to the number ramp (e.g., citing Guangzhou that intervened when they had 7 cases and 0 deaths vs. Wuhan that had 495 confirmed cases, 23 dead). In the US, there is concern about hospital inundation. US will not intervene as did Guangzhou. Already too late in response time.

One report summarizes the effectiveness of convalescent plasma as a potential therapy for COVID-19, citing historical situation learnings (e.g., SARS-CoV-1, The 1918 Spanish Flu). The logistics of this solution are not as straightforward…Government intervention is necessary. Method requires apheresis, blood banks, centrifuge. Would require Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER FDA) guidance. Arturo thinks putting together a federal task force would be necessary. The solution is scalable … 300mL for someone seriously ill (so 1 donor to 1 recipient). As a prophylaxis treatment, 5mL for someone equates to ~ one donor for dozens of individuals.",

Gilead’s antiviral drug Remdesivir stands out for potential to treat coronavirus. The drug has rapidly moved to phase 3 studies, with data expected by April. Antiviral medication development and application will move a lot faster than vaccines. Technical challenges associated with vaccine developments. Vaccines are the highest bar there is in terms of testing because it involves immunizing healthy individuals. Makes it difficult to compress timelines. Development and trial process can last 2-3 years. Phase 1 for safety. Phase 2 expanded to demonstrate safety and some efficacy. Phase 3 for safety and efficacy in natural disease conditions. Process should not be rushed. With respect to Coronavirus vaccines – there is a risk of immune enhancement –  where vaccine could actually make things worse (seen in lab animals). Similar to 1960’s Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine – inactivated vaccine in which vaccine recipients did worse, with more hospitalizations. One study identified  a target for vaccine and therapeutic development. From which an NIH grant was submitted based on the identification of a highly promising lead candidate vaccine antigen, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein.",

ACE2, a cell-surface protein on cells in the kidney, blood vessels, heart, and, importantly, lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells. The GI manifestations are consistent with the distribution of ACE2 receptors.
