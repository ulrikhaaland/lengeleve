  "content": "The objective of this study was to study the impact of a Mediterranean Diet on the primary prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). This study, a primary prevention trial, enrolled about 7,500 patients who were at high risk for CVD, but who had not suffered any Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE), and randomized them to one of three diets – two variants of a Mediterranean Diet, and a low fat diet. The two variants of the Mediterranean Diet were one that emphasized extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and another that emphasized nuts. All three arms were discouraged from consuming bakery goods, sweets, pastries, red meat, processed meats, and spread fats.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Broadly speaking, there are two (and an emerging third) types of studies in human nutrition: Efficacy studies – studies that elucidate the mechanism of action of food. Effectiveness studies – studies that elucidate to what extent free-living people will adhere to a dietary change, and determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of that change. Econometric studies – studies that elucidate how to change people’s behavior, by changing the defaults, the economic forces, and the cues.",

  "date": "February 27, 2013",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There was a relative risk reduction of 30% for the Mediterranean Diet relative to the control diet. However, there was no statistically significant difference in death (CVD or otherwise) or Myocardial Infarction (MI) across the three groups. The study was not large or long enough to detect if the dietary intervention results in a difference in MI or death.",

  "date": "February 27, 2013",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is 0.3065%. This means that 326 people would need to undergo this dietary intervention for about 4 or 5 years to prevent one “count” of the primary outcome. The clinical significance of this depends on the intervention. If this study were testing a drug with a 1% major toxicity rate, the answer would be no. Conversely, if this study were testing a drug with a 1% minor toxicity rate and a 0.001% major toxicity rate, the answer is not so clear.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The toxicity of a Mediterranean Diet has not been quantified to my knowledge. The QALY impact of a Mediterranean Diet is subjective, and each person needs to answer it for themselves. This is a good study, and a better study than the study prompting it, the famous Lyon Heart Study. I would have much preferred to see only one Mediterranean arm, in favor of a true control or another arm such as Very Low Carb. It’s impossible to guess what the ARR would have been for the Med Diet if the control was a standard fare diet, rather than a much improved low fat diet. If I had to guess, I’d ballpark the ARR at 1-5%, for a NNT of 20 to 100 people, but this is nothing more than speculation.",
