  "content": "Half of solving the longevity equation comes down to delaying the onset of chronic disease. The longest lived among us do not live longer with chronic disease; they live longer without them. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the most prevalent disease in the developed world, is the disease most likely to cause death into old age. Assessing ASCVD early, so that the wheels of prevention can be set in motion is crucial. Guided intervention with early risk assessment markers like non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) can delay the onset of ASCVD.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A recent study in JAMA concluded non-HDL-C is an important early predictor of ASCVD. The study reported that an elevated non-HDL-C in adolescence had the strongest association with ASCVD in midlife. The earlier that atherogenic risk can be identified by cholesterol risk markers, the better chance there is to address it and prevent disease at a later stage in life.",

  "context": "Cholesterol",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Non-HDL-C is used to assess atherogenic risk because it can estimate the mass of cholesterol molecules contained in potentially atherogenic lipoprotein particles. ApoB, a peptide found on the surface of certain lipoproteins, is a direct measurement providing the best assessment for the number of the lipoproteins capable of causing atherosclerosis. Non-HDL-C estimates the quantity of the cholesterol mass within particles, whereas apoB measures the number of the potentially atherogenic particles. Even though apoB has a greater predictive ability for ASCVD, non-HDL-C is still a good initial screening tool that generally correlates with apoB measures.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A prospective cohort study began in 1980 and followed 3 population groups over a 28-year period. The study recorded non-HDL-C, which was determined for 3 different life stages: adolescence, young adulthood, and mid-adulthood. In the final year of the study, the participants received a coronary artery calcium (CAC) scan to assess the presence and extent of coronary artery calcification, a manifestation and marker of very advanced coronary artery disease. The study then correlated the association of non-HDL-C and the presence of CAC in mid-adulthood. The study reported that, compared to having normal non-HDL-C, elevated non-HDL-C in adolescence was associated with a 16% increased likelihood of developing CAC in mid-adulthood.",

  "content": "Cardiovascular disease is a time-course disease, which is why age is such a strong predictor of risk. The longer your artery walls are exposed to atherogenic particles, the more likely they are to incur damage, which is why earlier exposure to these particles incurs more risk and most strongly correlates to disease later in life. The damage from atherogenic particles accumulates over the course of a lifespan, which means more disease, manifested as CAC, or worse: a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or sudden death.",
