  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In 1968, Steve met two patients in the ER that altered the course of his career… Steve was a junior resident at the West Roxbury VA Hospital. A 68-year-old fellow who came in complaining of right upper quadrant pain. It looked like a typical gallbladder attack, and Steve was excited because he might be able to perform one of his first operations. His chart contained a remarkable story. 11 or 12 years earlier, that patient had been seen at the West Roxbury VA Hospital. He had gastric cancer (a stomach cancer) and underwent a laparotomy. The surgeon at the time noted a tumor encompassing about three-quarters of the stomach; there were multiple liver metastasis deposits that were biopsied and shown to be the gastric cancer that had spread, multiple enlarged lymph nodes. Part of the stomach was removed and the rest of the disease was left in place. The patient recovered and about a week later, went home. This was now 12 years later; the patient has lived 10-11 years normally after this. Steve took part in removing his gallbladder and noticed his belly was completely clean of cancer. It was a cancer that had spontaneously disappeared over time in the absence of any therapy. One of the rarest events in medicine, and that is to have the spontaneous regression of cancer without any treatments being given. Steve wondered whether or not this patient who had somehow cured his own cancer could be somehow taken advantage of to treat other patients. It planted the seed that in fact, maybe there was something in the immune system that caused the rejection of that cancer much as it would a foreign transplant. The immune system is the body’s major defense mechanism against foreign invaders, and it got me thinking about potential immune manipulations. Steve was impacted by a second patient he saw about a year before he came to the Brigham as an intern. Patient received an early kidney transplant; the kidney inadvertently contained renal cancer. Under the influence of immunosuppressant medications, the cancer spread widely through his body. In an attempt to control this, the immunosuppressant medications were stopped. Of course, the kidney rejected and had to be removed, but the patient’s cancer then went away as well because it too was allogeneic; it too came from the genome of the original donor. For Steve, this was a huge inspiration that the immune system could be utilized to treat cancer. A large invasive vascularized cancer could be caused to reject completely by the immune system if you had a strong enough stimulus that could mediate that rejection. – Steven Rosenberg",

  "date": "September 27, 2021",
  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Consider a viral infection, whether it’s the common cold or Coronavirus. The virus infects respiratory epithelium and replicates in these cells. Infected cells express viral proteins. The immune system has evolved to detect proteins or other molecules that are not part of the normal cells of the body. B lymphocytes (B cells) make antibodies. T lymphocytes (T cells) act by directly interacting with other tissues. Every 14 or 15 seconds, the heart is pumping out lymphocytes, they are circulating through the vascular system, sometimes extravasating into tissues, coming back into the lymphoid system and returning to the heart via the thoracic duct. When the lymphocyte encounters a foreign antigen to which it can have reactivity that’s not cells. Lymphocytes encounter viral antigen in the respiratory epithelium; they stop at that location (this can be visualized with two-photon microscopy) they extravasate into the tissue then they begin to divide. As lymphocytes divide they further recognize viral protein and  start making molecules that can destroy the viral cell. They also call other cells into the area, macrophages and neutrophils, etc.   This is an immune reaction. The antigen is eliminated by these cells. Now the cells leave; they’re not stimulated; they go back into circulation. There are now long lived lymphocytes patrolling the body for the rest of one’s life that can recognize these viral antigens. This is why vaccination works. Cancer cells have unregulated growth because they don’t respond to cell cycle signaling. This is a result of somatic mutations; these are acquired mutations; people aren’t born with them. Mutations (changes in DNA) occur randomly as the cell divides; this can produce proteins that the immune system can recognize. Steve notes that only in the last 3-4 have doctors and scientists observed that these mutations are commonly recognized by the immune system. The immune system in about 80% of patients with epithelial cancer recognizes mutations in this cancer. The problem is the immune reaction against the cancer is not rigorous enough. Effector T cells can be very aggressive in recognizing antigens. Regulatory T cells act to suppress immune reactions. For a tumor cell to grow and survive it develops certain properties such as suppressing the local immune reaction. It can make molecules like transforming growth factor beta (TBF-𝛽) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). “It’s the balance of the aggressive immune reaction against the inhibitory molecules that can prevent that immune reaction that is the holy grail of trying to find effective treatments” – Steve Rosenberg.",

  "content": "TILs were isolated from melanoma patients, grown in vitro in the presence of IL-2 and given back to melanoma patients. The improvement seemed to be short-lived. Lymphocytes were the cause of these regressions. Now the question is, can these lymphocytes be modified to be more potent? Teamed up with scientists at the NIH, French Anderson and Michael Blaese, to modify TILs. The safety and feasibility of using gene therapy to add genes to T cells was demonstrated by adding the bacterial gene for neomycin resistance. The safety of genetically engineered T cells was accessed and paved the way for modifying T cells in ways to improve their ability to kill cancer cells. Removing regulatory T cells before administration of CAR T cells increased the response from about 25% to 55% in melanoma patients. First publication of T cells developed to target specific mutations was in 2014.",

  "content": "In 1985 Steve was asked to be part of the team that operated on President Ronald Reagan’s colon cancer. The chief of surgery at Bethesda Naval HOspital was an expert in vascular surgery, not oncology; an expert in oncology was needed. Steve got a call on a Friday evening to come to Bethesda Naval Hospital to help with a patient; it turned out to be President Regan. Before the post-surgery press conference, Steve’s explanation that the president has colorectal cancer got him into all sorts of trouble. Nancy Reagan didn’t want the cancer word to be used. She didn’t want foreign officials to ignore him because he has cancer. The press conference went on and the surgeon read the pathology report, it’s an adenocarcinoma in the distal portion of the colon. Nobody understood what he said. Steve was asked to explain this, so he said “The president has cancer.” In response to this, the Director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the time, Vine DeVita (who later became the chief at  Memorial Sloan Kettering) took Steve off a short list for the next director of NCI. He was very upset that Steve used the word “has cancer” instead of “had cancer”. The president recovered and never had a recurrence of his colon cancer.",
