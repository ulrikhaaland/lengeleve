  "content": "Peter is looking at exercise through the lens of longevity, not performance. The difference is important. If your goal was to break 2 hours and 40 minutes on the Chicago Marathon next year, the training required would be totally different from that needed to maximize longevity. Longevity is a very difficult performance goal. When you start to look into the far recesses of amazing physical performance, training would be very specific for that. This is not what Peter is discussing. Training for this type of performance is generally not collinear with longevity and at times they can be outright orthogonal.",

  "content": "This podcast is geared toward this Centenarian Decathlon. This is the idea of being the most kick-ass 90-year old possible. This is based on 2 energy systems: 1 – Strength and stability, 2 – Low-end aerobic energy system (which is zone 2, we’ll talk about that in a moment) which is punctuated with brief bursts of zone 5. These energy systems matter because this is generally where life takes place. By training in zone 2 and zone 5 (with much more focus on zone 2), we’re preparing metabolically and structurally for longevity.",

  "content": "What does Peter wish he incorporated into his exercise at age 25 to be in this race for the gold medal in the Centenarian Decathlon? For most people, a system of the body is going to fail first. For many people their mind fails first, cognition is taken from them and then eventually they die or their body breaks down. For most people, the decline of mind and body, and the burden of disease occurs as the body fails first. This prompted Peter to think about how to mitigate the decline / fail of the body.",

Each of his 18 goals (for his Centenarian decathlon) touch on at least 1 of these items in this framework; some touch on more than 1. Stability is where most people first begin to fail. This begins around the time that children start school.",

Some studies show 4% loss of strength per year.",

  "content": "How has Peter’s thinking changed on deadlifts? Long before powerlifting was in vogue, Peter would lift weights every day with a friend in high school. Powerlifting is different from olympic lifting, powerlifting is 3 lifts: the deadlift, the squat, and the bench press. Peter grew up doing a lot of deadlift, squatting, and bench pressing. He was always horrible at the bench press. In 2016 Peter partially tore one of his obliques. After this he was never able to deadlift again without some discomfort.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Deadlift can be performed in a way that puts your spine under traction, which is counterintuitive as one might think the spine is under compression when lifting under an axial load. When you learn the right positioning, you can deadlift and actively create traction in the spine. This involves understanding how to create intra-abdominal pressure and how to elongate your spine. This is beneficial especially before long periods of sitting, as it helps maintain an activated form of traction and prevents spine compression.",

It is a rate; it’s how much oxygen per unit of time can you process. VO2 max is like the size of your engine. It doesn’t tell you how fast you can run, but it tells you what sort of aerobic engine you have to play with.",

There are these other circuit-breakers limiting VO2 max, that aren’t on the path from mouth to lung, to blood, to muscle. There are other factors that detect low oxygen and cut off the supply to the muscle to make sure we don’t get stupid [deprive the brain of oxygen].",

  "content": "Stability is the cornerstone upon which your strength is delivered, your aerobic performance is delivered, and your anaerobic performance is delivered. And it’s the way that you do so safely. Stability is the way that we transmit force from the body to the outside world in the safest manner possible, across the muscles which are designed to carry that load. This is opposed to seeing the dissipation of force across joints that are not fit to do so. Most of us are born with the ability to do this naturally, but it generally gets lost by the time we begin grade school due to a relative lack of activity and an abundance of sitting. This is one of the root causes of a lot of the chronic injuries many of us have. Stability is the foundation upon which all exercise should be done.",

Cardio days are Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday with 45 minutes of zone 2 training on Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday. Saturday is either a zone 2 workout followed by zone 5 workout or a longer bike ride, more of an anaerobic workout. Weightlifting is done on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday with lower body on Mondays and Fridays, and upper body on Wednesdays and Sundays. The lifts are always done AFTER doing cardio because the reverse has been shown to erode strength-training gains. If a day is missed, the lifts are never compromised; they will always get 4 lifts in per week. Sometimes it means moving the days around or doubling-up on another day.",
