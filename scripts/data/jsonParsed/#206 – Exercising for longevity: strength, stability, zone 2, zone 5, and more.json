  "content": "Looking at exercise through the lens of longevity, not performance. The difference is important. If your goal was to break 2 hours and 40 minutes on the Chicago Marathon next year, the training required would be totally different from that needed to maximize longevity. Longevity is a very difficult performance goal. When you start to look into the far recesses of amazing physical performance, training would be very specific for that. Training for this type of performance is generally not collinear with longevity and at times they can be outright orthogonal. Exceptional physical performances requires maximum cardiac output, just beneath VO2 max. This level of performance and training puts an amazing strain on the body. While this is better than sitting on the couch all day, it is past the point of optimizing longevity returns. This comes at some longevity cost relative to training at a lower energy system.",

They took that normalized unit of strength per CT area and observed when it was reduced by 0.2 units, there was a 26%.

This is counterintuitive; you might think your spine is under compression when lifting under an axial load. It turns out when you learn the right positioning, then you can deadlift and actively create traction in the spine. You understand how to create intra-abdominal pressure. You know how to elongate your spine. This is why the deadlift is the most important thing he does before he gets on an airplane. He’s going to be sitting for 5-6 hours. He doesn’t want his spine to be compressed. The deadlift primes him to maintain that activated form of traction.",

VO2 max is a rate; it’s how much oxygen per unit of time can you process. VO2 max was first discussed/measured in the 1920s by a guy named A.V. Hill, a very good runner himself.
