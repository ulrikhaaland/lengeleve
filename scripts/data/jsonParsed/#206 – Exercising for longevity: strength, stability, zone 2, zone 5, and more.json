  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter is looking at exercise through the lens of longevity, not performance. The difference is important. Longevity is a very difficult performance goal. Training for this type of performance is generally not collinear with longevity and at times they can be outright orthogonal. Exceptional physical performances requires maximum cardiac output, just beneath VO2 max. This level of performance and training puts an amazing strain on the body. While this is better than sitting on the couch all day, it is past the point of optimizing longevity returns. This comes at some longevity cost relative to training at a lower energy system.",

For most people, the decline of mind and body, and the burden of disease occurs as the body fails first. This prompted Peter to think about how to mitigate the decline / fail of the body.",

He does 1 zone 5 workout a week‒ 3 minutes of zone 2, 1 minute at VO2 max (this is quite difficult to keep this up for 1 minute). Repeat this 4-minute pattern for 20-30 minutes. He does this on the tail-end of a zone 2 workout; so this is his longer aerobic day.

This is controversial and limitations can arise in any part of this cascade. Conventional wisdom is that the lungs are not the limitation, you can always breathe enough in and they don’t respond to training because they’re overbuilt. But a review was published arguing that in some cases (such as highly-trained endurance athletes), the lungs aren’t overbuilt and can be a limitation on VO2 max. There is also the situation where an athlete is so fit, their heart pumps blood so quickly past their lungs, that it doesn’t have time to fully stock-up on oxygen. This results in exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia. This is usually an issue at altitude. About half of endurance athletes experience this at sea level. There is debate on this because there isn’t any 1 single answer; limits of VO2 max can occur anywhere along the cascade of taking oxygen in and the muscle using it in the production of energy.",
