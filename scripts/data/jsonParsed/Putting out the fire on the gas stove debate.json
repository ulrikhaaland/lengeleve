  "content": "There has been growing attention to the potential risks lurking in the seemingly benign corners of our homes, and this time, the source of the danger appears to be the gas stove, a fixture in many American households. While studies have generally shown a correlation between gas stove use and respiratory problems such as asthma, the extent of this effect remains a subject of ongoing scientific debate. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has raised a note of caution, urging consumers to be mindful of the potential risks and consider alternative cooking methods. This alarm comes in light of a study published in December of 2022 in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health that added weight to these concerns, highlighting a concerning correlation between gas stove use and childhood asthma.",

  "title": "Study on Gas Stove Use and Childhood Asthma",
  "date": "April 1, 2023",
  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The study aimed to quantify the population-attributable fraction (PAF) for gas stove use and childhood asthma in the United States. The PAF is an estimate of the proportion of disease or health outcomes in a population that can be attributed to a specific risk factor. It is calculated by determining the proportion of people with a certain outcome, such as asthma, who were exposed to a particular factor, like gas stoves, and comparing their risk to those who weren’t exposed. They found that 12.7% of current childhood asthma in the U.S. is attributable to gas stove use.",

  "title": "Limitations of PAF",
  "date": "April 1, 2023",
  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The PAF quantifies the proportion of disease cases that would be prevented if a specific risk factor were eliminated, under the assumption that the risk factor is causally related to the disease. It does not in any way provide evidence of causality. Disease development is often the result of multiple factors or forces acting together – from genetics to environmental exposures to lifestyle choices. Calculating a PAF is an attempt to partition causality into distinct contributions from separate factors, but in reality, they may interact in complex and nuanced ways, so elimination of one may not lead to the expected reduction in disease burden.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Gas stoves emit nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a respiratory irritant that can cause inflammation and damage to the airways. NO2 can exacerbate asthma symptoms by increasing airway hyperresponsiveness, making the airways more sensitive to triggers like allergens or viruses, and children may be particularly vulnerable because their airways are still developing and they may spend more time indoors than adults.",

  "title": "Reducing Exposure to Gas Stove Emissions",
  "date": "April 1, 2023",
  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Complete elimination of exposure is not practical or possible, but we have many options – such as spot ventilation (range hoods), natural ventilation, and air purifiers – for reducing exposure to excess NO2 attributable to gas stoves without needing to replace the stove entirely. The U.S. EPA’s safety limit for NO2 is 100 parts per billion (ppb), and they estimate that ambient air averages about 53 ppb. Previous work has shown that NO2 levels in homes with gas stoves typically range from 25-75 ppb, or about 15-25 ppb more than homes without gas stoves. According to a study at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the most effective strategy is to employ a range hood while cooking. The authors report that use of a range hood eliminated 60-87% of NO2 associated with stove use.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The link between gas stove use and respiratory problems such as asthma has long been a subject of intense debate among both the scientific community and the general public. Although a recent study has brought public attention to a correlation between gas stove usage and asthma risk, it’s important to put these findings into perspective both by understanding their limitations and by recognizing the means at our disposal for reducing any excess risk. With the availability of spot ventilation, natural ventilation, and air purifiers, households can significantly decrease their exposure to harmful emissions and reduce the risk of health issues associated with gas stove use.",
