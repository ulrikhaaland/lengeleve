  "content": "A study published in December of 2022 in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health highlighted a concerning correlation between gas stove use and childhood asthma. The researchers found that 12.7% of current childhood asthma in the U.S. is attributable to gas stove use. In other words, the proportion of childhood asthma that could be theoretically prevented if gas stoves were eliminated is 12.7%, a number that varied by state, with Illinois having the highest at 21.1% and Florida having the lowest at 3%.",

  "content": "The meta-analysis on which the study is based leaves room for doubt. It is composed of observational studies, which, as we’ve seen so many times, are subject to confounds. Still, an association is certainly plausible. Gas stoves emit nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a respiratory irritant that can cause inflammation and damage to the airways. NO2 can exacerbate asthma symptoms by increasing airway hyperresponsiveness, making the airways more sensitive to triggers like allergens or viruses, and children may be particularly vulnerable because their airways are still developing and they may spend more time indoors than adults.",

  "content": "While the extent of the effect of gas stove use on respiratory problems such as asthma remains a subject of ongoing scientific debate, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has raised a note of caution, urging consumers to be mindful of the potential risks and consider alternative cooking methods. Gas stoves emit nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a respiratory irritant that can cause inflammation and damage to the airways. NO2 can exacerbate asthma symptoms by increasing airway hyperresponsiveness, making the airways more sensitive to triggers like allergens or viruses, and children may be particularly vulnerable because their airways are still developing and they may spend more time indoors than adults. So, it is important to reduce exposure to NO2 by ensuring proper ventilation and using alternative cooking methods.",

  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The U.S. EPA’s safety limit for NO2 is 100 parts per billion (ppb), and they estimate that ambient air averages about 53 ppb. Previous work has shown that NO2 levels in homes with gas stoves typically range from 25-75 ppb, or about 15-25 ppb more than homes without gas stoves. (This concentration can increase considerably during cooking in the immediate vicinity of the stove, but when it comes to risk for chronic conditions like asthma, average exposure over time is the relevant measurement.)",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "According to a study at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the most effective strategy is to employ a range hood while cooking. The authors report that use of a range hood eliminated 60-87% of NO2 associated with stove use, and these results were obtained using only a range hood as a source of ventilation. Utilizing this strategy in combination with others, such as fans or air purifiers, will further diminish excess exposure and risk of harm.",

  "content": "With the availability of spot ventilation, natural ventilation, and air purifiers, households can significantly decrease their exposure to harmful emissions and reduce the risk of health issues associated with gas stove use. Considering that these mitigation strategies can together effectively eliminate the excess risk, the issue at hand is inconsequential. These simple yet effective measures can ensure a healthier and safer home environment for ourselves and those around us.",
