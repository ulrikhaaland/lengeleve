In parts of Europe they’ve restricted Moderna in anyone under age 30. There’s also this interesting idea— the myocarditis from vaccination may be different than the myocarditis from the infection itself. Monica also notes the difference in the amount of RNA the vaccines contain. Moderna has 100 micrograms, Pfizer’s 30 micrograms. So that dose difference probably explains why myocarditis could be more seen with the Moderna vaccine. She thinks the best study on this is from Canada. That showed that the risk of myocarditis after the second dose is more with higher dose Moderna vaccine. And also more if there is a shorter period between the 2 doses. This is why spacing the doses has been such a strategy in Canada of 8 weeks or even longer between doses.",

Dr. Stanley Plotkin wrote a Clinical Infectious Disease article in January. He was saying we need to space them out longer for 2 reasons. 1) One was to save more lives because if there is a limited supply, we want to save more lives by giving people just 1 dose (and then give them the second dose later). 1 dose will provide some T cell immunity. 2) And then the second was he said that in any field of vaccinology (and now this has been shown in a Cell paper) if you give longer time between doses, you get a better response. Published October 15, 2021, Immunogenicity of standard and extended dosing intervals of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Not just increased antibody responses, but fundamentally what we were talking about is we want to develop cellular memory. There’s better T cell responses if you space them out, the doses, by 8 weeks or so. Peter asks what would be the ideal time to give a booster to somebody who has 2 shots of Moderna or Pfizer. Nobody would be 1 year out from their second show now because these things just became available. Is giving a booster in less than a year the optimal way to boost long-term immunity? Would we be better off boosting less frequently? Monica explains, to extrapolate on the 3-dose vaccines from the hepatitis B vaccine and the human papilloma virus vaccine— the longer the time between the 2nd and 3rd doses, the better.",

One of the few things that  is morally offensive is the automatic tribalism, the dismissal of people because of something that they thought early on. He sees universities, who ironically are supposed to be champions of data and scientific reason, revert to these primitive practices that are almost barbaric. They’re definitely cruel on students.

This is an infusion of a partially intact immune system, real antibodies. Essentially, monoclonal antibodies that pharma companies make is the same thing. They’re just antibodies made in a laboratory and they tend to be all one type, hence the name monoclonal as opposed to polyclonal antibodies. So, in the convalescent plasmas, there is a more diverse antibody profile. Arguably this is better. Marty thinks the backlash against convalescent plasma is politically driven. The trump administration had a lot of enthusiasm for it. There was confusion about it. The head of the NIH, Francis Collins, was asked to weigh in on convalescent plasma; and he said, “We need a randomized controlled trial”. Marty thinks this was a cop out. They had strong data in a non-randomized fashion. We should do a randomized control trial, but what he did is he threw water on any sort of interest in using it clinically. The news media distorted it. Pharma companies were saying, “Hey, we’re making antibodies. Why use convalescent antibodies?” Convalescent plasma fell to the wayside. Marty reached out to the study authors of the first trial that showed a benefit, the New England Journal of Medicine, and they said, “That study was flawed. The design was flawed. We need more research and trust us, it’s coming.” And they were very frustrated. They eventually published a study that came out very recently that looked at concentrated convalescent plasma. Concentrated convalescent plasma provides more antibodies. It was a well done study. It showed a dramatic reduction in hospitalization, a reduction by 50%. But nobody talks about it.",
