He has this “anaphylactic reaction to things that are logically inconsistent, but it serves no purpose other than to hurt me”. He’s worried about the integrity of the medical profession and the broader discipline of science. He has many friends and some patients who have completely lost faith in this profession. This is the ax he’s grinding. He’s very upset about what the implications of this are down the line.",

  "content": "Only 2 out of the 3 work on the Delta variant. Over the last few weeks, the people who have been showing up in the hospital in deep trouble medically tend to be heavily skewed towards the remaining Delta variant. Now, if the CDC estimates are correct, Delta is 1.7% of new cases as of January 14th or so. That tells us that the influx, that the ongoing damage that this is causing in terms of severe illness, is really letting up right now just by the dominance of Omicron. There is only 1 monoclonal that works well, the GSK monoclonal, sotrovimab. This is the only one that works well on Omicron. But if Omicron is as mild as we’re seeing, that tells us we should be using it selectively in high risk individuals.",

They’re just antibodies made in a laboratory and they tend to be all one type, hence the name monoclonal as opposed to polyclonal antibodies. So, in the convalescent plasmas, there is a more diverse antibody profile. Arguably this is better.",
