There were other small studies, withheld by Merck, that showed excess heart attacks in those taking Vioxx. One in 50 absolute risk for hard mortality outcome. At the time, it was not clear who was at risk, but 80 million people took Vioxx. Most people that have severe osteoarthritis are also having comorbidities that would put them at risk for heart attack (a ubiquitous disease).",

But nonetheless, they can distinguish features progressively as they go through this network. And then you get outputs. Technological advancements made in the field have been recognized by the A.M. Turing Award: Geoffrey Hinton and his colleagues received the award for engineering breakthroughs of deep neural network computing. Ongoing studies will demonstrate superiority of image definition accuracy, or as good as through machine.",

In other words, I don’t think the CGM data as the input feed would be sufficient. You’d have to constantly be pairing it with your activity and other sensors. If you had the cortisol sensor and the lactate sensor, then that starts to become remarkable predictive power. Peter’s dream with the CGM: This is my pipe dream is I want to be able to say, Go into the algorithm and tell it your desired average glucose, your desired variability. I want an average glucose that’s below a hundred milligrams per deciliter or below 110 milligrams per deciliter. I want a standard deviation that doesn’t exceed 15 milligrams per deciliter. Now you tell me what I can eat. Spend the first month watching me eat, learning how my body responds to every different food and go from there.",
