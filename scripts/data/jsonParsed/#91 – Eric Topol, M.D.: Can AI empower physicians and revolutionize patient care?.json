The VIGOR trial tested rofecoxib against another NSAID, naproxen, and found that, while the two groups had similar rates of CV-related deaths and overall mortality, Vioxx had a higher mortality rate. Merck attributed the comparatively high heart attack rates to an unproven protective effect of naproxen. Merck tried to intimidate Topol in order to get the paper withdrawn. There were other small studies, withheld by Merck, that showed excess heart attacks in those taking Vioxx. One in 50 absolute risk for hard mortality outcome.

Takes a matter of hours to learn a person well enough to make recommendations for a cardiogram but cannot diagnose anything else like ventricular rhythm (algorithms have not been validated yet). Eric uses a six-lead cardiogram with patients where the sensors are put on the leg. With every patient, Eric takes their pulse as well as the six-lead cardiogram. This allows Eric to see if they have an arrhythmia, and have any conduction system abnormalities. Patients could even do this test on their own at home at some point.

Furthermore, if you have realtime lactate you are estimating mitochondrial oxidation and therefore fuel partitioning. So, for example, the reason that right now Peter’s glucose is 94 and if he ate a bagel it would only go up to 104 is because he’s so glycogen depleted from not eating for 20 hours and having worked out. Conversely, after a big dinner which spiked your glucose to 120, and then it comes down to 94, if you were to eat that same bagel under those new conditions it would spike glucose much higher. A very important input into predicting that variation in how your blood glucose is going to respond to a particular meal is knowing glycogen stores and insulin sensitivity of the muscle and all these other things. Regarding the role of the gut, Peter is wanting to know: How many different macro phenotypes of gut biome are there that really matter? Eric’s response: He leans towards believing that each person’s unique individual response throughout their day is impacted by the gut. But… he understands the skeptical point of view on the gut and says: “it is early stages of research and the importance of studying the gut still needs to be validated”",

If a doctor is able to make a diagnosis for a patient in 5 minutes, they are 95% accurate, but if it takes them longer than that their accuracy falls to 24%. “We just are reflexive. We don’t reflectively go over anything. We don’t have time, we don’t assimilate all the data. We can’t because there’s so much . . . [we have to ] acknowledge that we can do far better but it can’t all be through human support. We need help.” – Eric Topol, M.D. Machines plus humans will always be better than just machine or just humans. Machines can vastly improve areas like radiology and critical care. But humans will always be better at the interaction with other humans and the connection/bond. Machines don’t have the context and deep, human nuanced issues that doctors can pick up. “They [machines] don’t have context. They’re not going to be able to truly understand all the nonverbal communication and the real issues of a person that are deep. And that’s where the humanity, we need to bring it back.
