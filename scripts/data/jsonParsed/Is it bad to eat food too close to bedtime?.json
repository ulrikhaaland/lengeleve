  "content": "It is advised to cut off all eating at least 3 hours before bed. The principal reason is that when you lie down, you’re more likely to get acid reflux and have digestive issues. Additionally, eating can raise your core body temperature. You need to drop your core body temperature by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep and then to stay asleep. That’s why it’s easier to sleep in a cold room than a hot room.",
