  "content": "Natural fruits are different; they have much less fructose in an individual fruit. Eat an orange and it has 6-8 grams of fructose, closer to 6 g of fructose and some glucose. There are certain fruits that are high in sugar— mangoes, figs, dates. Figs are very, very enriched in fructose; fFigs are probably something that we should avoid. Apples and pears, plums, tend to be fairly high, around 9-10 grams. Bananas are fairly high glycemic; they have a fair amount of fructose, but it’s probably in the range of 6-8 grams. Most fruits are between 3-9 g, 10 g max, with the average being 4-6 g (see the table below). Some fruits have much less sugar— kiwi and berries (strawberries and blueberries).",

  "content": "Rick did a study, they gave people a low sugar diet that was low in refined sugar and low in high fructose corn syrup. Published in Metabolism in 2011, The effect of two energy-restricted diets, a low-fructose diet versus a moderate natural fructose diet, on weight loss and metabolic syndrome parameters: a randomized controlled trial. One group got natural fruit, but was low sugar and low fructose. The other group was restricted too. They found equivalent improvement in metabolic syndrome in both groups. “The presence of natural fruit did not block the ability of the low sugar diet to improve metabolic syndrome” – Rick Johnson",
