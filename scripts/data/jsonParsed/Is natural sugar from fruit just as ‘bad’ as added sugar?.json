  "content": "Natural fruits have much less fructose in an individual fruit. Fruit juice is made from multiple fruits. An orange has 6-8 grams of fructose, closer to 6 g of fructose and some glucose. Certain fruits that are high in sugar include mangoes, figs, dates. Figs are very enriched in fructose and are probably something that should be avoided. Apples, pears, plums tend to be fairly high, around 9-10 grams. Bananas have a fair amount of fructose, but it’s probably in the range of 6-8 grams. Most fruits are between 3-9 g, 10 g max, with the average being 4-6 g. Some fruits have much less sugar— kiwi and berries (strawberries and blueberries).",

  "content": "A study was conducted where people were given a low sugar diet that was low in refined sugar and low in high fructose corn syrup. One group got natural fruit, but was low sugar and low fructose. The other group was restricted too. They found equivalent improvement in metabolic syndrome in both groups. The presence of natural fruit did not block the ability of the low sugar diet to improve metabolic syndrome.",

  "date": "June 24, 2022",
  "context": "Sugar",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The intestine acts as a shield for 4-6 grams of fructose. Eating 4-5 g of fructose in a fruit is okay because the intestine’s going to provide protection. In addition, there is fiber in a natural fruit and that slows the absorption so the concentration of fructose that goes to the liver is lower. This results in less ATP depletion.",
