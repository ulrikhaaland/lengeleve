  "content": "Cholesterol is an essential organic molecule in our body. We eat it, we make it, we store it, and we excrete it in different amounts. Cholesterol exists in 2 forms – unesterified or 'free' and esterified – and the form determines if we can absorb it or not, or store it or not. The pool of cholesterol in our body is essential for life. No cholesterol equals no life. Eating cholesterol has very little impact on the cholesterol levels in your body. Cholesterol and triglycerides are not soluble in plasma and are therefore said to be hydrophobic. To be carried anywhere in our body, they need to be carried by a special protein-wrapped transport vessel called a lipoprotein.",

  "content": "The progression from a completely normal artery to a 'clogged' or atherosclerotic one follows a very clear path: an apoB containing particle gets past the endothelial layer into the subendothelial space, the particle and its cholesterol content is retained, immune cells arrive, an inflammatory response ensues 'fixing' the apoB containing particles in place AND making more space for more of them. While inflammation plays a key role in this process, it’s the penetration of the endothelium and retention within the endothelium that drive the process. The most common apoB containing lipoprotein in this process is certainly the LDL particle. If you want to stop atherosclerosis, you must lower the LDL particle number.",

  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The measurement of cholesterol has undergone a dramatic evolution over the past 70 years with technology at the heart of the advance. Currently, most people undergo a 'standard' lipid panel, which only directly measures TC, TG, and HDL-C. LDL-C is measured or most often estimated. More advanced cholesterol measuring tests do exist to directly measure LDL-C, along with the cholesterol content of other lipoproteins. LDL-P (or apoB) is the best predictor of adverse cardiac events, which has been documented repeatedly in every major cardiovascular risk study. LDL-C is only a good predictor of adverse cardiac events when it is concordant with LDL-P; otherwise it is a poor predictor of risk.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "HDL-C and HDL-P are not measuring the same thing, just as LDL-C and LDL-P are not. Secondary to the total HDL-P, all things equal it seems smaller HDL particles are more protective than large ones. As HDL-C levels rise, most often it is driven by a disproportionate rise in HDL size, not HDL-P. In the trials which were designed to prove that a drug that raised HDL-C would provide a reduction in cardiovascular events, no benefit occurred. But, this says nothing of what happens when you raise HDL-P.",

  "content": "There are no long-term studies examining the exact role of dietary intervention on cardiovascular disease. There are short-term studies, which look at proxies for cardiovascular disease, but all of the long-term studies are either drug studies or multiple intervention studies. The 'dream' study would follow 2 randomized groups for many years and only make one change between the groups. Group 1 would consume a standard American diet and group 2 would consume a very-low carbohydrate diet. Furthermore, compliance within each group would be excellent and the study would be powered to detect 'hard outcomes' (e.g., death), instead of just 'soft outcomes' (e.g., changes in apoB, LDL-C, LDL-P, TG).",

It is entirely plausible that an elevated level of LDL-P or apoB in someone consuming a high-carb diet portends a greater risk than someone on a ketogenic or low-carb diet.",

The group that had all fructose and HFCS removed from their diet, despite still ingesting 55% of their total intake in the form of non-sugar carbohydrates, experienced a decline in total TG. However, that same group experienced the greatest increase in fasting TG levels. Post-prandial TG levels were elevated in all groups, but significantly higher in the fructose and HFCS groups.",

  "content": "It is very difficult to make the case that when carbohydrates in general, and sugars in particular, are removed or greatly reduced in the diet, insulin resistance is not improved, even in the presence of high amounts of saturated fats. When insulin resistance improves, we are less likely to have the signs and symptoms of metabolic syndrome. As we meet fewer criteria of metabolic syndrome, our risk of not only heart disease, but also stroke, cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease goes down.",

  "content": "The consumption of sugar increases plasma levels of triglycerides, VLDL and apoB, and reduces plasma levels of HDL-C and apoA-I. The removal of sugar reverses each of these. The consumption of fructose alone, though likely in dose-dependent fashion, has a similar, though perhaps less harmful, impact as that of fructose and glucose combined. The addition of fat, in the absence of sugar and starch, does not raise serum triglycerides or other biomarkers of cardiovascular disease.",
