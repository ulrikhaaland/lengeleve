  "date": "October 8, 2018",
  "context": "Cholesterol",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter found Dave’s model unconvincing for three reasons, and provided them in the intro of the podcast: “Dave was unable to explain the mass balance, meaning how does one account for the greater amount of cholesterol in, and the greater number of, LDL particles. No one, including Dave, is disputing that the phenotype of interest has more LDL-C and more LDL-P. There are only 3 ways this can happen (these are [collectively exhaustive, but not [mutually exclusive]): make more, clear less, transfer from other pools that we can’t see (e.g., cell membranes). I think the data make the first of these by far the most likely driver, but Dave seemed unable to address this and could not explain, to me at least, what could account for this increase in LDL-P/C. So on first principles, my doubt of this model has gone up from the start of this discussion, as the person who developed the model could not actually explain the mass balance. This is one of the most fundamental requirements of any model. And to be clear, even if this fundamental condition were met, it would not be sufficient to make the case that [lean mass hyper-responders or LMHRs] are not at risk. It’s a [necessary but not sufficient] criteria that, in my mind, has failed.” “Dave argues that VLDL production is driving the LDL concentration, but the fact remains that in insulin-sensitive people (which presumably the LMHRs are), the opposite is true: there are fewer, not more, TG being exported from the liver and there is less, not more, apoC-III on the VLDL, thereby reducing, not increasing, their residence time. In other words, LMHR would have less VLDL to LDL conversion than, say, someone with T2D. So again, I can see no evidence whatsoever that his energy model, which can’t be explained on mass balance, and can’t be explained on what is known about the physiology of VLDL and LDL, is plausible.”",

We have 2,000 natural experiments. Surely at least some of these cases (e.g., PCSK9 gain of function) are excellent proxies for the key features of LMHR. Yet to ignore them for imaginary reasons (e.g., having gain of function PCSK9 is somehow toxic to endothelial cells because it impairs their ability to take up cholesterol despite there being no evidence that endothelial cells require PCSK9 to uptake LDL in a receptor-mediated fashion) is to say, in my opinion, one does not want to know the answer to this question.”",

This is relatively well understood to be a gradient phenomenon, so the more lipoproteins you have, the more of them that are going to go in, Peter says. Other things will influence it: the residence time for example, which might be why apoC-III may be a problem, because if it allows these cells [lipoproteins] to stick around longer, bad things could happen. HDL particles always come out of there. The problem occurs when proteoglycans bind to the apoB on LDLs, it gets retained, all of a sudden now you have something that’s where it’s not supposed to be, Peter says.
