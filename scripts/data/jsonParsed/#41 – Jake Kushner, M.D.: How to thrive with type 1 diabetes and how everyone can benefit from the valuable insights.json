Dr. Bernstein’s book transformed Jake’s thinking about treating diabetes: Dr. Bernstein’s Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars. The Law of Small Numbers: If you consume more carbs, you need more insulin and therefore there’s a greater opportunity to make a mistake. If you consume fewer carbs, you will consume less insulin and you’ll have fewer mistakes. The book helps both those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. He figured out that if you avoided carbohydrates and if you give medium and long acting insulin to cover protein and fat and basal metabolic requirements, that you could get blood glucoses very, very close to normal. He typically prescribes a low carb, high protein diet ⇒ It’s not low carb, high fat, it’s not ketogenic. In my patients with type one diabetes who consume protein and don’t cover it with insulin, they can get these massive glucose excursions. And the essence of the Bernstein method is to try cover protein with insulin. And he uses regular insulin (i.e. human insulin), not fast-acting insulin (i.e. Novolog). And the idea is that regular insulin, which is human insulin, has a peak of onset within approximately an hour or two, and it lasts for six to eight hours. So the regular insulin very roughly corresponds with the kinetics of what protein will do to your glucose. Unfortunately the insulin pump companies and even the insulin companies have advocated an approach that says, ‘Look, people who live with type one diabetes have tough lives. We need to support them, and they should be allowed to eat what they want. And they should just cover for it.’ . . .And the problem is you end up with these crazy oscillations. And the oscillations are associated again with a tremendous burden of illness and this cognitive load and this fear and this anxiety.",

He also now sees way less patients so that he can spend much more time with each person.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "People with T1D that are trying to get into nutritional ketosis have a few unique problems: 1 Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The normal person has an insulin response that suppresses ketones once it reaches the 6 or 7 millimolar level, where someone with T1D does not have the insulin to do this. So they could reach dangerous levels of ketones resulting in DKA. In other words, prolonged fasting in a person who lives with type one diabetes. 2 Euglycemic DKA. This is a new phenomena. This is seen in T1D patients that are using sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors). Mostly seeing this is people with T1D, not so much T2D. WARNING: These are not safe (yet) for type 1 diabetics, however, Jake is involved in clinical trials looking to add safety and monitoring mechanisms. 3 Nutritional ketosis and hypoglycemic awareness. People who are in hardcore ketosis who have circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate may become completely immune to low blood glucoses. In other words, there can be cases where someone has dangerously low blood glucose (say 25) and yet they feel fine due to the presence of ketones. The problem, however, is that they may go from feeling fine to fatally low blood glucose without warning.",
