  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Elevated Lp(a) concentration is widely recognized as an independent risk factor for ASCVD. Lp(a) particles contain another surface protein called apolipoprotein (a), abbreviated apo(a), which binds to apoB. Such LDLs are what we call Lp(a) particles and are a two-member family. In the rest of this discussion, LDLs with apoB but no apo(a) are referred to as “real LDL” particles and those having both apo(a) and apoB are referred to as Lp(a) particles.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Despite the enormous benefit of statin medications in reducing LDL, ongoing concern lingers over the observation that, in certain patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), statin therapy results in elevated concentration of Lp(a). Not only are statins ineffective at reducing Lp(a), they may, in some people, even increase Lp(a) particle production by inducing the synthesis of apo(a).",

  "date": "November 5, 2022",
  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The authors used intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography to determine how statin-induced changes in Lp(a) affected plaque progression and quality. A total of 85 participants (mean age of 62 ± 11, 58% male) on high-dose statin therapy (rosuvastatin 40 mg) were divided into two groups – low and high – depending on baseline Lp(a) levels. In the “low” and “high” groups, mean Lp(a) concentrations were 44.5 ± 51.6 mg/dL and 118.8 ± 50.3 mg/dL, respectively, with the high Lp(a) group also demonstrating significantly thinner (84 ± 32 vs. 103 ± 44 µm, p=0.046) minimal fibrous cap thickness (FCT) – the thickness of the thinnest (and thus weakest) point in the cap. The duration of treatment was not stated in the author’s brief presentation but is expected to be included in their upcoming publication of this work. (We assume a period of at least 4 months based on previous work indicating that this is the length of time it takes for statins to increase Lp(a).)",

  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Statins are only effective at clearing real LDL and not Lp(a) (again, due to apo(a) interfering with particle binding to the LDLR), but Lp(a) accounts for only a small percentage of total LDL. So despite the fact that these medications do not reduce concentrations of Lp(a) – and may even increase it by 5-20% – they are so effective at clearing real LDLs from circulation that total LDL-P or apoB is significantly reduced despite any Lp(a)-P increase. In other words, the effect of statins on real LDLs – which constitute the overwhelming majority of apoB particles – is so profound that it dominates the net impact of these drugs on ASCVD risk.",

  "content": "All current Lp(a) guidelines, fully cognizant of statins’ potential ability to increase Lp(a), suggest that a mainstay of reducing Lp(a)-related ASCVD risk is to consider statin therapy. So although trials have long established that statins can increase Lp(a) concentrations, the Minatoguchi et al. study lends support to the idea that such increases are not of clinical importance. Any change in risk associated with an increase in Lp(a) is overwhelmed by the magnitude of the effect of statins on real LDLs; and therefore, no one should cease statin therapy due to any increase in Lp(a).",
