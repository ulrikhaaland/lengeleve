  "content": "Since the approval of lovastatin in the U.S. 35 years ago, statins have been a game-changer in reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and combating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). An LDL particle is a lipoprotein within a specific density range and is a collection of lipids (mostly cholesterol) enwrapped by a single protein called apolipoprotein B (apoB). LDLs are a two-member family, as some LDL particles contain another surface protein called apolipoprotein (a), abbreviated apo(a), which binds to apoB. Such LDLs are what we call Lp(a) particles, and elevated Lp(a) concentration is itself widely recognized as an independent risk factor for ASCVD.",

  "content": "Despite the enormous benefit of statin medications in reducing LDL, ongoing concern lingers over the observation that, in certain patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), statin therapy results in elevated concentration of Lp(a). Recently, new data on the effect of high-intensity statins on both Lp(a) and coronary lesions was presented. The results provide food for thought and generate a reassuring hypothesis regarding statin-induced Lp(a) elevation.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "CAD is characterized by the buildup of plaques in the arteries which serve as the heart’s blood supply. These plaques are composed of a lipid-rich core primarily made up of oxidized lipids, including cholesterol and cholesterol crystals. Overlying the lipid core is a fibrous cap generated by smooth muscle cells, and the thickness of this cap determines the potential for plaque rupture and clot (thrombus) formation, a main cause of heart attacks and strokes. The thicker the cap, the less likely the plaque is to rupture.",

  "content": "After statin treatment, Lp(a) in the low group rose significantly. Yet despite the increase in Lp(a), FCT had improved in both groups at follow-up. The lack of effect on – or even improvement in – FCT led the authors to conclude that the increase in Lp(a) on high-intensity statin therapy was not an independent predictor of changes in FCT and does not appear to be of clinical significance.",

  "content": "Lp(a) is the single most important genetically-inherited trait driving ASCVD risk. Total LDL particle concentration (LDL-P) is the sum of real LDLs + Lp(a). Particle for particle, Lp(a) particles are more atherogenic than real LDLs. However, over 90% of all LDL particles in circulation are of the latter, apo(a)-negative group, and in the majority of people, Lp(a) particle number is quite small and thus does not contribute to total LDL-P or total LDL-C.",

So despite the fact that these medications do not reduce concentrations of Lp(a) – and may even increase it by 5-20% – they are so effective at clearing real LDLs from circulation that total LDL-P or apoB is significantly reduced despite any Lp(a)-P increase.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "All current Lp(a) guidelines, fully cognizant of statins’ potential ability to increase Lp(a), suggest that a mainstay of reducing Lp(a)-related ASCVD risk is to consider statin therapy. So although trials have long established that statins can increase Lp(a) concentrations, the study lends support to the idea that such increases are not of clinical importance. Any change in risk associated with an increase in Lp(a) is overwhelmed by the magnitude of the effect of statins on real LDLs; and therefore, no one should cease statin therapy due to any increase in Lp(a).",
