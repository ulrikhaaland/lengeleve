In this episode, Lauren tells the heartbreaking story of watching members of her family succumb to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) which motivated her to proactively address her own risk with Richard’s guidance. Richard discusses the various genetic and lifestyle factors that influence the risk of AD and uses Lauren’s unique situation to explain how he diagnoses patients and personalizes care. They go through Lauren’s protocol of preventative measures that have already produced marked results, and end with the uplifting message that one’s genetic predisposition does not seal one’s fate.",

Differences in manifestation are mainly dictated by which regions of the brain are affected by the disease. For example, when someone has pathology in the back of the brain, where vision processing occurs, they may have difficulty interpreting images. Based on this, Peter offers the analogy that like cancer, Alzheimer’s is more than just one disease.",

What Richard believes to be happening in women: Perimenopause is a “brain disease”. During perimenopause there are metabolic shifts in the brain that can predispose to acceleration of Alzheimer’s pathology. He also believes that this is underappreciated and can be countered with appropriate use of estrogen replacement. The disruption of sleep, the brain fog, problems with processing speed and attention, are all symptoms of perimenopause. Perimenopause transition is a huge unrealized risk factor for progression to dementia in an Alzheimer’s susceptible woman.",

But the criticism comes from the thinking that there’s nothing you can do to change your course (which isn’t true). A quick example, people with E4/E4 don’t absorb omega-3 fats from eating fatty fish very well, therefore they should be supplementing with omega-3 from an early age to protect the brain. The REVEAL study showed that disclosing ApoE4 status did not cause clinically significant anxiety or depression. Head trauma may be more of a concern in individuals with the ApoE4 variant, which is additional justification for testing. Peter believes knowing the child’s ApoE status would be an important factor in choosing to play contact sports like football. Richard agrees that playing sports like football can impose increased risk in conjunction with being an ApoE4 carrier, but also acknowledges that it is a difficult topic – “These are really difficult conversations to have, but knowledge is power”",
