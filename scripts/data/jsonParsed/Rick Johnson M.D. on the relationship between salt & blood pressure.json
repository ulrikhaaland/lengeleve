  "content": "Rick Johnson found that high uric acid levels could be driving inflammation in the kidneys, leading to high blood pressure. He did studies in adolescents who were overweight and discovered that many of them had high uric acid levels and high blood pressure. He also did studies in animals and saw that when they raised uric acid, the animals developed high blood pressure. He did a study where they randomized adolescents with high blood pressure to drugs to lower uric acid or not. The results were remarkable, 90% of them normalized their blood pressure when their uric acid levels were lowered.",
