  "content": "Salt is important in blood pressure. In animals that are sensitive to high blood pressure, blood pressure can be worsened by giving them salt. Studies showed that if you put people with high blood pressure on a salt restriction, this lowered blood pressure. This has led to recommendations to restrict salt in people with high blood pressure. As we get older, we become more sensitive to the effects of salt on blood pressure. People with high blood pressure have inflammation in their kidneys. This inflammation tends to be in the main part of the kidney where the tubules are and around the little blood vessels. The inflammation was actually maintaining the kidney in a state where it couldnâ€™t get rid of salt very well. This occurs by creating reduced blood flow to the kidney. People with high blood pressure have reduced blood flow to their kidneys. When the blood flow is reduced, this affects the ability of the kidney to excrete salt, and triggers the retention of salt.",

  "content": "High blood pressure is an inflammatory disease that is driven by inflammation. Many things could drive inflammation in the kidneys. Some drugs are very vasoconstrictive; cocaine, for example, and other things that constrict the renal arteries. Activation of the renin angiotensin system, for example, can cause ischemia to the kidneys and bring in this inflammation. But one thing that seems to drive it is a level of high uric acid.",

  "content": "Studies in adolescents who were overweight revealed that many of them had high uric acid levels and were discovered to have high blood pressure. Studies in animals showed that when they raised uric acid, the animals developed high blood pressure. A study was done where adolescents with high blood pressure were randomized to drugs to lower uric acid or not. The results were remarkable, 90% of them normalized their blood pressure when their uric acid levels were lowered. There was a 5-8 mm drop in ambulatory blood pressure.",
