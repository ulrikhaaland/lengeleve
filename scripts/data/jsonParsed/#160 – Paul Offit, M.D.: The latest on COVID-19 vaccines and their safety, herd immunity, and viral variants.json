We don’t know about T cell response, but we can’t depend on it, so if it’s failing the B-cell test, we’re going to take action.

With shorter incubation periods, best you can do is modify disease.

Takes 3-5 days to get activation and differentiation of memory cells. This is true of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rotavirus. But with a disease like measles (long-incubation period), as long as you have memory cells, you have plenty of time for activation and differentiation of those cells to become antibody-reading cells. So in that case can eliminate rather just modify disease. SARS-CoV-2 is in between, has a 6-day incubation period. Virus in the bloodstream is really not an important part of pathogenesis, so IgG memory is a bit less important. Paul thinks that we can control this infection.

Upon reinfection, virus is broken down into small (10- to 15-mer peptide) fragments on the surface of major antigen-presenting cells: dendritic cells, macrophages, and to some extent B-cells. The presentation of the antigen stimulates T-helper cells to stimulate B-cells to make antibodies and stimulate cytotoxic T-cells to kill virus-infected cells. As long as you have immunological memory, you will get activation and differentiation of memory B cells to become effector (antibody producing) cells and cytotoxic T-cells to become cells that kill virus infected cells. Crotty’s work suggests that memory cells for natural SARS-CoV-2 infection is fairly long-lived. Data on mRNA viruses suggest that there is stimulation of T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells after the second dose (implying a longer-lived response).

  "content": "Not uncommon and Paul has seen it up close. Many of the kids had no symptoms when they were infected, about a month later, they come in with high fever, involvement of heart, liver, lung, and kidneys, heart enzymes spilling out into the bloodstream. The kids test negative with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test but they are antibody positive. Their immune system has been induced to make an inflammatory response against themselves, primarily against the cells that line blood vessels. It’s largely a vasculitis, which can affect every organ’s blood supply. Paul thinks some of these kids are going to have long-term problems. Like Kawasaki disease, it could be another multisystem inflammatory disease that causes long-term heart issues.",

One study found that a year later, antibody titres were still slightly raised but not always protective. Paul thinks we might be protected for a few years, but not probably not decades.",

  "content": "Two theories about origin of SARS-CoV-2: virus came from a bat or a bat via some intermediary mammal and made its way to humans, escape of a virus in a lab that happened to be near Wuhan. Three labs near Wuhan did this type of research, not believed to be deliberate, but perhaps an accidental breach in protocol. Laboratories have done gain-of-function studies to see what would happen if they alter a virus so it can do things it cannot do naturally. Paul is actually not sure humans are smart enough to have engineered this virus given how many things it can do. To confirm the story we’d need to compare sequences of those early strains as well as sera from people in China from before this virus was said to have spread. We’re dependent on a whistleblower from Wuhan. Paul’s theory it that it jumped from a bat to humans.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter says that the greatest single failure in the past year, mostly on the part of the government, was how long it took to get testing up and running. Too many things weren’t in place: reagent for PCR tests, PCR machines, and other critical infrastructure were lacking. If we were prepared, as soon as we had the sequence, we would have been able to rapidly deploy tests. Other things went well, like the speed with which the vaccine has been developed, and “the evolution of insight into critical care has actually been pretty darn impressive”. But testing speed fits Peter’s analogy of waiting way too long to hit the brakes and then slamming on the brakes and crashing the car. Paul agrees: we had the sequence by January of 2020 and the virus started to kill Americans two months later. We “put all our eggs in the CDC basket” and needed many more groups making and quality controlling the tests. The CDC messed up the test – their negative control ended up being positive so those tests were useless. by the time that all got sorted out, South Korea had done 500,000 tests when we had done fewer than 5,000 (although we are a much more diverse population and are less “cower-able”). we did not have great federal leadership: we would have been much better off if we’d focused on getting testing in place, quarantining, and restricting national travel. “We are roughly 4% of the world’s population and 20% of the world’s deaths when we have a technologically and economically advanced society. So, there’s really no excuse for doing it as badly as we did it.” —Paul Offit",
