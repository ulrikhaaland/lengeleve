Theory mostly confirmed by about 1973. It predicted the existence of two particles that carry the electroweak force. An international team of physicists ran the Underground Area 1 (UA1) experiment that discovered the “weak” W and Z bosons. UA1 was headed by a Harvard physicist, Carlo Rubbia, who was working at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva. Discover decided to do a “Scientists of the Year” feature and chose Rubbia, who was expected to get the Nobel Prize. Around April of 1984, Rubbia came to Washington and gave a presentation announcing that he was now doing physics beyond the standard model. Gary proposed to Rubbia that Gary come to CERN and document the process as it happened and Rubbia agreed. The Atlantic rejected Gary’s proposal because Charles Mann and a co-author at the time, Bob Crease, had just proposed doing a piece on high energy physics. Then Shelly Glashow, a Nobel Laureate at Harvard, recommended Gary to his publisher and it agreed to fund the book. Gary was “embedded” with the physicists for 9 months.",

It was front page news all around the country. When Gary found out that there was a competing group at Brigham Young University, he assumed Pons and Fleischmann were wrong. The desire to establish reliable knowledge beyond reasonable doubt can be compromised by the motivation to get there before the other team. This happened at CERN with Rubbia and UA1.

They claimed it was net energy positive. The concept was to compress it so much that it fuses and generates neutrons, gamma rays, or other signs of radioactivity, which would indicate that there was a nuclear reaction going on or at least a lot of heat. One of the cold fusion cells exploded, which they took as a sign of nuclear fusion. After their announcement, “everyone in the world tries to replicate it because it seems it holds the promise of infinite free energy” – the wealth of OPAC. It costs about $3000 worth of materials to put together a cold fusion cell, so anyone can study it. Around the world, people were trying to replicate Pons and Fleischmann’s work. Most correctly concluded that cold fusion doesn’t exist, but maybe 6 labs (for reasons that tended to be different for each lab) got it wrong. Gary had the opportunity to embed himself with scientists while they tried to replicate the experiment. Within 2-3 months it was clear that Pons and Fleischmann had been wrong and then the story died out. Gary saw it as a case study in bad science and the price of doing so of claiming something to be true that later turns out not to be.

Follow them and then look back to see of there was a difference in what those who got sick and those who did not were eating.

The first data on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet to stop hypertension was about to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A was a low fat diet with lots of fruits and vegetables. It was supposed to be a one-page article, for which a reporter would typically call the principal investigator (PI) if the article was not yet published and maybe two other people who could comment. Gary didn’t know that the article had been leaked to Science in advance along with a list of researchers they could interview. He called the PI, Larry Appel. Then he calls a former president of the American Heart Association at the University of Alabama Birmingham. She says she can’t talk about the paper or she’ll lose funding. He asks her to tell him off the record what’s wrong with the paper so the article can be accurate, but she refuses. Calls another researcher, who yells at him that there’s no controversy over salt and blood pressure even though that was not the topic of the article. Gary spent the next 9 months looking into the salt / blood pressure debate, interviewed about 85 people, discovered that it was “one of the most vitriolic controversies in the history of medicine”. By 1998, Americans had been eating low-fat diets for 15-20 years, but randomized control evidence never really supported it. Involved a lot of bad epidemiology with questionable associations and no established causation. The researcher who had yelled at him when he was writing the original article was a character who sounded exactly like Walter Matthau over the telephone. It became clear to Gary that he “was one of the worst scientists I’d ever interviewed in my life”. He took credit for the reduction in both salt and fat in American diets. Gary decided to write about dietary fat next because he “if the dogma was based in any substantive way on this fellow’s work, there’s a story there”. “I’ve been living in LA eating my egg whites and probably a 15% fat diet. Dean Ornish would have been proud of me”. He interviewed 145 people for that article, The (Soft) Science of Dietary Fat. That piece and the salt article, The (Political) Science of Salt, both won National Association of Science Writers Science and Society Awards.",

Brobeck did an experiment where he pair-fed a lesioned and a non-lesioned animal. 3 of 12 got fatter, which Brobeck assumed meant something was wrong with those 3, so he left them out of the analysis.

The researchers doubted they’d be able to see an effect on fat mass in the course of four weeks, so measuring fat mass directly by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) wasn’t a possibility. So measured energy expenditure instead. In any case, DXA was going to be confounded by water loss, so it might not have been valid when someone was transitioning from a low fat to a very low carbohydrate diet. But that measurement has been used in recent NIH papers. Calorimetry and DLW give you two different results, one of which is more consistent with each hypothesis. Results not robust of comparing results measured two different ways.

But today the American Diabetes Association recommends these diets for type 2 diabetics (~10% of the public). Many people acknowledge that they can be beneficial for weight control. Clinicaltrials.gov lists over 200 trials studying the effects of ketogenic diets on epilepsy, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and even traumatic brain injury. People are now more aware that ketogenic diets are an option and that they won’t kill you. Researchers also find the clinical efficacy of these diets worth studying. Today they make statements that would have been considered unacceptable 20 years ago, including the acceptance that insulin plays a major role in fat accumulation and obesity.
