It begins with a fatty streak that later consolidates into plaques that can ultimately lead to a reduction in blood flow. Reduction in blood flow is called ischemia. Ischemia results in tissue damage to the heart and this is what results in a heart attack. A heart attack can be fatal depending on the amount of cardiac tissue that is damaged from loss of oxygenation.",

He doesn’t think this is true today, but it was 25 years ago. Maybe now 1/3 of first events are fatal, sobering nonetheless. The textbook went through, in great detail, the pathological staging of atherosclerosis. It was also littered with autopsy sections of coronary arteries from people who had died for other reasons. Notably, many of these people died from other causes, but their coronary arteries were studied in autopsy; these people were quite young. A 26-year-old male victim of a gunshot wound. A 27-year-old female who died in a motor vehicle accident, etc. Looking at their coronary arteries, one realizes they already have atherosclerosis. They have oxidized apoB-bearing particles engulfed by macrophages and thickened intima. While they may not have calcification in their arteries yet or the types of plaque that would rupture within the ensuing weeks or days or months, they nevertheless had atherosclerosis. Now what Peter’s professor said some 20 years earlier made sense.",

These parts of the body need to receive cholesterol. This poses a problem because the circulatory system is the main way things are transported throughout the body. Many things are transported in the circulatory system without difficulty such as glucose, lactate, and electrolytes. Cholesterol is a lipid and not water soluble (hydrophilic). It is hydrophobic. We can’t move cholesterol directly through the circulatory system. The solution is to use a vehicle to transport cholesterol in the blood. A lipoprotein is part lipid and part protein.

It’s all miasma for him. Allan thinks hypertension arises from the loss of elastins in the proximal aorta, and that causes systolic hypertension. He doesn’t think it’s complicated. Now, what could accelerate this process? The proximal aorta is elastic; if one looks at a flow curve (a hydrostatic pressure curve) when a patient is young it’s rounded because as the left ventricle ejects blood rapidly into the aorta, the aorta expands and absorbs some of that energy. Recall that wind castle that they’ve mentioned in school, but the energy is partially captured, partially regained; but the wall isn’t battered; the wall can give way. Imagine if those elastic fibers start to go, then the walls stiffen; now when the left ventricle ejects blood, the pressure goes up more rapidly and it falls more rapidly in diastole.
