  "content": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is ubiquitous and has a major impact on human longevity. It is inevitable and everyone dies with it. Extending lifespan comes down to delaying the onset of chronic disease, and atherosclerosis is the most common chronic disease. Two main paths to atherosclerosis are hypertension (high blood pressure) and lipid abnormalities. Studies show ASCVD begins at a young age. The most common presentation for a 1st heart attack is sudden death. A 1st heart attack in over 50% of people is fatal.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a disease state characterized by the deposition or the buildup of cholesterol in the artery wall. It begins with a fatty streak that later consolidates into plaques that can ultimately lead to a reduction in blood flow, called ischemia. Ischemia results in tissue damage to the heart and this is what results in a heart attack. A heart attack can be fatal depending on the amount of cardiac tissue that is damaged from loss of oxygenation. Cholesterol is an organic molecule, a type of lipid. It is used for the cell membrane of every cell in the body and for the synthesis of many hormones.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Every major guideline in the world bases their selection of subjects for statin prevention on the 10-year risk of disease. But this approach fundamentally makes prevention of premature disease almost impossible. The calculation is driven by the age and sex of the patient. Things like cholesterol and blood pressure contribute minimally to the actual calculation of ten-year risk. So prevention really starts at 55 to 60, but almost half of all infarcts and strokes occur before the age of 60. There are two fatal flaws in the 10-year risk approach. Risk is a good concept but doctors should be selecting people based on causes of CVD. There’s a real challenge predicting singular events.",

When one lumps together a bunch of those different genes that have different makeups, you can see fairly substantial differences in cholesterol. You have information on somebody that’s fixed at birth [genotype], and you see if that is associated with a difference in outcome. With Mendelian randomization, you’ve gotten rid of a lot of stuff in the middle. What a number of Mendelian randomization studies have shown is that apoB includes all the information in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and even HDL cholesterol; it sums them.",

If one can identify which genes map to which phenotype (and one can figure out the genes that mapped to the phenotype of our interest, namely driving up or down a variable of interest such as apoB) then there’s no worry about the confounders that occur in between, because the genes can’t change. Now when a difference in outcome is observed, it’s much more likely to be causally related to the phenotype of interest because the gene that underlies it has not changed.",

If in the last 5-10 years the incidence of major adverse cardiac events is rising despite our advances, you could argue that measuring LDL-C and using it as our proxy for treatment is problematic. As dyslipidemia is growing in the metabolic context, we know these phenotypes are associated with a greater discordance between apoB and LDL-C. This suggests you have a greater and greater portion of the population that is being undiagnosed or underdiagnosed because you’re treating their LDL-C and believe their risk is lower when really their apoB is higher [so their risk is higher].",
