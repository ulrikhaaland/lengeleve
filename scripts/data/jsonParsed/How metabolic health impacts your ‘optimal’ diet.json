For example: When Peter works with patients who are metabolically healthy, he’s never once restricted the amount of fruit they consume. But when working with a patient who has type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, he will actually restrict how much fruit they consume. This is because both fructose and ethanol are pretty uniquely poised to make a sick liver sicker. Does that mean that that person’s going to always be restricting fruit? ⇒ No, not necessarily, but empirically, it seems easier in those people to reduce fructose intake and to do so through fruits.",

  "title": "Defining Metabolic Health",
  "date": "June 21, 2022",
  "context": "Metabolic disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There’s a lot of different ways you can define it. It’s sort of like BMI is the easiest way to to define overweight and obesity but body composition would be a better way to do it. Similarly, the quickest and easiest way to define metabolic health is probably to use the criteria for metabolic syndrome. metabolic syndrome is basically defined in a binary fashion where if you have three or more of the the following five criteria you are considered to have MetSyn: Increased blood glucose, Abdominal (truncal) obesity, High fasting triglycerides, Low HDL cholesterol, High blood pressure. That said, Peter doesn’t use this with his patients since he’s not trying to make assessments at a population base level. He’s looking at many more factors beyond those things, such as: oral glucose tolerance tests, uric acid levels, homocysteine levels, the entire lipid profile, and functional testing like how the mitochondria perform in a zone two test, how much lactate is a person producing at rest and then how much lactate did they produce under increasing amounts of workload.",
