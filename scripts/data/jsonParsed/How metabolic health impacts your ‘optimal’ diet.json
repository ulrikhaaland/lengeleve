  "content": "How one’s current state of health impacts their “optimal” diet. Don’t confuse the optimal diet for you in a state of health versus the optimal diet for you in a state of sickness that’s trying to restore your health. For example: When working with patients who are metabolically healthy, the amount of fruit they consume is not restricted. But when working with a patient who has type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, the amount of fruit they consume is restricted. This is because both fructose and ethanol are pretty uniquely poised to make a sick liver sicker. It seems easier in those people to reduce fructose intake and to do so through fruits.",

  "content": "There’s a lot of different ways you can define metabolic health. The quickest and easiest way to define metabolic health is probably to use the criteria for metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is basically defined in a binary fashion where if you have three or more of the the following five criteria you are considered to have MetSyn: Increased blood glucose, Abdominal (truncal) obesity, High fasting triglycerides, Low HDL cholesterol, High blood pressure. However, many more factors beyond those things are looked at, such as: oral glucose tolerance tests, uric acid levels, homocysteine levels, the entire lipid profile, Functional testing including how the mitochondria perform in a zone two test, how much lactate is a person producing at rest and then how much lactate did they produce under increasing amounts of workload.",
