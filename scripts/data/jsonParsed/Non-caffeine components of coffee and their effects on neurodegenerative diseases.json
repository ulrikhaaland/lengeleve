  "content": "Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world, with a sizable percentage of the adult population drinking it daily. In addition to providing a morning energy jolt, coffee may have a number of long-term benefits. Studies point to the beverage’s protective effects against a wide range of pathologies, including cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease. Coffee contains hundreds of other bioactive compounds, including oils, tannins and other polyphenols, non-caffeine alkaloids, and even trace amounts of minerals and vitamins. Caffeine plays an important role in mediating some of coffee’s long-term effects. However, animal studies suggest key roles for other coffee constituents. Many of these compounds demonstrate anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antifibrotic, and antimicrobial properties, each of which may contribute to enhancing neurocognitive function and protecting against neurodegenerative diseases.",

  "title": "Health Effects of Chlorogenic Acid in Coffee",
  "date": "January 14, 2023",
  "context": "Cognitive Health & Neurodegenerative Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Among the most abundant compounds present in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee is a class of polyphenols known as chlorogenic acids (CGAs). CGAs and their metabolites are known to have antioxidant properties which, according to some in vitro and animal studies, may have neuroprotective effects. In cell culture, CGA treatment was shown to enhance expression of the antioxidant enzyme NQO1 and reduce neuronal cell death. A metabolite of CGA – caffeic acid – has been found to improve learning and memory in a dose-dependent manner in rats and in mouse models of AD.",

  "date": "January 14, 2023",
  "context": "Cognitive Health & Neurodegenerative Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Trigonelline, the second most abundant alkaloid in coffee beans after caffeine, also shows evidence of protective effects against dementia and AD. In cultured neurons, trigonelline treatment enhances key steps in the formation of neuronal interconnections, and molecular modeling indicates that it has high affinity for amyloid-β and may interrupt formation of amyloid aggregates. Trigonelline protects against oxidative stress and impairments in memory – these effects appear to be dose-dependent. Trigonelline may also exert neuroprotective effects via anti-inflammatory properties.",

  "title": "Challenges in Studying Coffee's Health Effects",
  "date": "January 14, 2023",
  "context": "Cognitive Health & Neurodegenerative Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "When it comes to coffee, a number of unique factors serve to amplify the usual epidemiology problems of controls and confounds. Decaffeination removes more than caffeine. Various studies have sought to differentiate between the effects of caffeine and other bioactive coffee compounds by comparing caffeinated versus decaffeinated coffee. Not all coffee beans are created equal. Three separate species of coffee plants give rise to the beans sold commercially, each with variations in chemical profiles. The technique of brewing, coffee-to-water ratio, water temperature, coffee grind size, filtration method, and brewing time all affect the ratio of different chemicals present in the finished beverage.",

  "content": "A cup of joe is a complex mixture containing not only caffeine but also a variety of other bioactive compounds. While caffeine does not appear fully responsible for the “magic” of a daily brew, the effects of each individual component on cognition remain poorly understood. Further research on each compound in isolation may provide valuable insights, but such studies cannot capture the potential interactions between these elements, which may be critical to the observed effects of whole coffee on cognitive function and dementia risk. The heterogeneity of coffee beans and preparation styles also adds complexity to the investigation.",
