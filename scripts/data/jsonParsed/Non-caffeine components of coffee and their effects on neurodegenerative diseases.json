  "content": "Coffee contains hundreds of other bioactive compounds, including oils, tannins and other polyphenols, non-caffeine alkaloids, and even trace amounts of minerals and vitamins. Accordingly, one of the biggest challenges to understanding the effects of coffee as a whole is the difficulty in disentangling the effects of each compound present within it, all of which may further exhibit complex synergies with each other.",

  "content": "Among the most abundant compounds present in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee is a class of polyphenols known as chlorogenic acids (CGAs). CGAs and their metabolites are known to have antioxidant properties which, according to some in vitro and animal studies, may have neuroprotective effects.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Trigonelline, the second most abundant alkaloid in coffee beans after caffeine, also shows evidence of protective effects against dementia and AD. In cultured neurons, trigonelline treatment enhances key steps in the formation of neuronal interconnections, and molecular modeling indicates that it has high affinity for amyloid-β and may interrupt formation of amyloid aggregates. Further, studies in mice and rats have revealed that trigonelline protects against oxidative stress and impairments in memory – again, these effects appear to be dose-dependent. Trigonelline may also exert neuroprotective effects via anti-inflammatory properties, as treating rats with trigonelline has been shown to reduce expression of the inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6. However, these results are far more preliminary.",

But when it comes to coffee, a number of unique factors serve to amplify the usual epidemiology problems of controls and confounds: Decaffeination removes more than caffeine. Coffee beans are heterogenous. Method of preparation matters.",

  "content": "A cup of joe is a complex mixture containing not only caffeine but also a variety of other bioactive compounds. While caffeine does not appear fully responsible for the “magic” of a daily brew, the effects of each individual component on cognition remain poorly understood. Further research on each compound in isolation may provide valuable insights, but such studies cannot capture the potential interactions between these elements, which may be critical to the observed effects of whole coffee on cognitive function and dementia risk.",
