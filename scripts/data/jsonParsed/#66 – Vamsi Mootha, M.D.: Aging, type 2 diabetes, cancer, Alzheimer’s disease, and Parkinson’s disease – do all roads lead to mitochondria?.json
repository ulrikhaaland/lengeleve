Within the organelle, replication factors turn on in the organelle that essentially says: “make more of the nuclear DNA components, mitochondrial DNA components and mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins”. The transcription program increases mitochondrial density in a given cell. Within a myocyte (muscle cell), physiologic-level signalling instruct a cell to make more DNA in response to exercise. One important signal that induces mitochondrial biogenesis is AMP kinase: change in the ATP:ADP ratio. There is sensing of ATP:ADP ratio decrease that promotes an increase in AMPK activity. It is still an open question as to how exactly the number of mitochondria is sensed and regulated but some of the inputs have been identified. Transcriptional cofactor PGA-1α regulates mitochondria biogenesis. SIRT1, which utilizes NAD as a cofactor directly affects PGC-1α activity through deacetylation.",

Alternatively, the NADH/NAD ratio can also be converted to a gradient, or voltage, across the inner mitochondrial membrane that can drive transport. Chemical bonds from food are broken and energy is released, creating an electron gradient. The gradient powers the phosphorylation of ADP (putting a phosphate group onto the ADP), creating ATP. Voltage is an energy potential gradient created by disproportionate placement of electrons (across the membrane). The ability to keep a difference in charge across the membrane powers the “work”.",

During that process, protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane generating about 150 MV that can be used to do work – including catalyzing conversion of ADP to ATP (oxidative phosphorylation). In addition to the role of NAD as an electron carrier, the NAD molecule can also be used as a substrate for other reactions. NAD as a cofactor is used by sirtuins and PARPs in the DNA damage response pathways. If there is a cell with damaged DNA, the NAD can decline rapidly.

But, in addition to producing ATP, the mitochondria also consume oxygen. In fact, most of the oxygen in a cell is consumed by the mitochondria. When a patient has a birth defect of the mitochondria, in addition to not being able to produce sufficient ATP, they also have excess oxygen. Oxygen delivery to the cell is typically not a problem but the oxygen utilization is poor. It may not be just about ATP production… it’s also about excess, unused oxygen.

  "content": "Previously, hyperbaric oxygen has been proposed as a treatment for mitochondrial rejuvenation. Vamsi’s lab experimented with hyperoxia conditions as well. 55% oxygen conditions, as is the saturation in an operating room. The mice with Leigh Syndrome die within a few days of exposure. There have been some anecdotes that suggest high oxygen levels on a broken electron transport chain can be very damaging, in line with the experimental findings in mice. There is a subset of tumors – where there may be mitochondrial mutations to begin with – for which Vamsi’s lab is exploring hyperoxic exposure. Hyperbaric oxygen has been proposed as a cancer therapy in the past. There have been mixed signals of efficacy. It may be that with precise targeting, (based on mitochondria markers) hyperbaric oxygen can be effectively used for certain cancer treatments.",

  "content": "Chronic diseases have altered mitochondria: Evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction causing Parkinson’s Disease. Not clear if dysfunctional mitochondria is the cause or part of the disease effect. Systems biology and insights taken from rare disease research may inform a subset of chronic disease understanding. The causal hypothesis for Parkinson’s Disease is particularly compelling. The pathology of rare monogenic mitochondrial disease resembles molecular features of mitochondrial dysfunction seen in Parkinson’s Disease. In some Parkinson’s Disease cases, the root cause is mitochondrial toxicity that results in dopamine loss (via herbicide or insecticide exposure, which are toxic to Complex I). Evidence for direct toxicity to mitochondria in humans can give rise to Parkinson-like disease phenotype. Mouse models given a high does of rotenone – a Complex I poison – has been used as a model for Parkinson’s Disease.",

  "content": "Why Vamsi is very optimistic about the possibility of targeting mitochondrial proteins as therapies. In the laboratory, mitochondrial disease can be alleviated in a preclinical way using hypoxia. Another preclinical approach uses protein prosthesis. Proteins from other organisms are transplanted into human cells (ex-vivo) with mitochondrial disease and effectively rescue the cells. As a result of reductive evolution, certain organisms lost parts of their ETC and others, their entire ETC. One way organisms who have lost their entire ETC may be able to survive is because they gained a new protein in replacement. These isolated proteins placed in a human cell can poison the mitochondria in five different ways but the cell will reproduce. Hypothesis that prosthesis corrects part of the redox imbalance but not the full proton pump capability of the ETC.",

  "content": "Vamsi’s fantasy experiment in an unconstrained world [2:20:15]. One possible experiment would be motivated by his lab’s recent work on oxygen and mitochondrial dysfunction. In preclinical models, oxygen depleted air seems to be beneficial. In normal aging, when there is a subtle decline in mitochondrial activity, is there excess oxygen and would breathing thinner air be beneficial? Crossover study with two treatment groups at different elevation, large participant cohort, treatment length in the order of months to years. Compare biomarkers of aging and age associated disorders. To test the idea that thin air might be beneficial for chronic disease. This type of natural experiment has actually been reported in one paper from the early 1970s, published by the Indian army. The study reported on health outcomes of more than 100,000 troops deployed to the Indo-China border. One group was at extremely high altitude and another group was not for a number of years. Although other parameters – such as food, temperature, activity – were not controlled for, the altitudes and therefore oxygen saturation between the two locations were different. Chronic diseases were reduced during the time living at altitude.",
