In the process, protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, and oxygen is reduced to form water. The mitochondria takes fats, carbohydrates and proteins and breaks down the energy forms, harnessing the electrons. The NADH/NAD ratio is an electron carrier that can power certain types of enzymes.

During that process, protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane generating about 150 MV that can be used to do work – including catalyzing conversion of ADP to ATP (oxidative phosphorylation).
