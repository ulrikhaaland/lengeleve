Rick suggests that doing nutritional and exercise related maneuvers when you’re at 135 over 85 should be the way to go. Dietary changes can reduce blood pressure. But the trouble with when someone gets to 140 over 90, if they can’t lower their blood pressure by dietary means, they should go on an antihypertensive medication because it will provide protection over time. Rick hasn’t seen any evidence that antihypertensives provide long term benefit to patients with a blood pressure of 135/85. He’s not sure about pharmaceutical interventions. Peter notes that “the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence”; perhaps this should be studied.",
