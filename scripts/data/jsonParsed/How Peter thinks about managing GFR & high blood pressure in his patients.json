  "content": "The role of hypertension in chronic disease and tips for lowering blood pressure were discussed. The standards on hypertension might need to be revised to ensure people's kidneys have a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) above 40 at the age of 100. A blood pressure of 120 over 80 is preferred, but if it’s 135 over 85, nutritional and exercise related maneuvers should be the first approach. Dietary changes can reduce blood pressure. Blood pressure can be fixed by diet— reducing salt, picking healthier foods, and exercising.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "When someone's blood pressure reaches 140 over 90, if they can’t lower their blood pressure by dietary means, they should go on an antihypertensive medication because it will provide protection over time. However, there is no evidence that antihypertensives provide long term benefit to patients with a blood pressure of 135/85. The trouble with defining hypertension at a lower level, is it implies that antihypertensive should be used at those lower levels and the evidence is not strong enough to warrant that.",

  "content": "If one compares people with a blood pressure of 135/85 to 120/80 over five years, it’s not going to reveal enough of a difference. This creates a problem with how the guidelines are created, but it shouldn’t confuse the underlying physiology. If more stringent definitions of hypertension are used, then suddenly a very large number of adults have hypertension. And if you then say that they need treatment for it in terms of like an antihypertensive, then you’re talking about probably the majority of the population.",
