  "content": "Insulin resistance can be combated with all 5 tools in the toolkit: 1) Pharmacologic agents 2) stress/cortisol management 3) sleep strategies 4) exercise, and 5) nutrition. By definition, insulin resistance is a carbohydrate tolerance disorder. Insulin resistance patients generally respond better to carbohydrate restriction than any other form of restriction. They respond very well to calorie restriction by definition typically includes carbohydrate restriction. It doesn’t have to be a ketogenic diet. Rather tell everyone to stay under a certain amount of carbs, a standard is set in terms of average blood glucose and a standard deviation from that average. A Dexcom CGM is used to monitor this. As those numbers start to come down and the insulin starts to come down and all these other things start to go, that’s exactly what reversibility looks like.",
