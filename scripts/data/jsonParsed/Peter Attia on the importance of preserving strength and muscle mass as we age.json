  "content": "Peter discusses the impact of muscle size and strength on mortality risk. He emphasizes the importance of fighting against the effects of aging and the loss of lean mass and strength over time. Studies show a decline in strength of 1-4% per year after the age of 50, resulting in a loss of 35-40% between the ages of 20 and 80. Peter stresses the importance of being above average in terms of strength, muscle mass, and cardiorespiratory fitness to maintain health and function in old age.",
