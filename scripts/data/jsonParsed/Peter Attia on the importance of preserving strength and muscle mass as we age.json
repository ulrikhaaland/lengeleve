  "content": "Muscle size and strength have significant impacts on mortality risk. The loss of lean mass and strength over time due to aging is a serious concern. Aging can lead to a decline in strength at a rate of 1% to 2% per year after the age of 50, with a total loss of 35 to 40% between the ages of 20 and 80. Some studies even show a 4% strength loss per year.",
