Thimerosal is still in some flu vaccines in US, although they can also be given as a single dose. No association between thimerosal and any adverse health effect was ever established. Bobby Kennedy made thimerosal his cause. Thimerosal does not cause autism, which is associated with prenatal events. But Kennedy got involved and a couple of books made that claim. Gained momentum as Wakefield’s claim had. Hotez addressed these claims in his book Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism. Peter clarifies the difference between thimerosal and methylmercury.",

Peter’s patients sometime ask if they should vaccinate their kids on the delayed schedule. The parents often wonder if the logic behind the current vaccine schedule is just based on the fact that it is convenient to vaccinate babies during the first year when they are going to the doctor often. For example, most kids are not at risk of getting Hep B so they might think ‘why are we having to vaccinate babies for this?’",

  "content": "Hotez brings up Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), which causes a type of bacterial meningitis. When he was doing his residency in 1987/1988  he’d admit a child with Hib meningitis every few weeks. The child then had a high likelihood that kid was going to have permanent neurologic injury or might not even survive. back then there was a vaccine targeting the polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP) capsule of Hib that might help a handful of older kids who could still mount an immune response, but no vaccine that worked in infants. John Robbins and Rachel Schneerson of the National Institute of Child Health & Development at the NIH figured out that it had to be haptenized (the antigen had to be joined to a carrier protein for vaccine to work). Developed a conjugate vaccine that worked in infants. Robinson, Schneerson, and David Smith and Porter Anderson in Rochester figured out that if the PRP capsule was haptenized, the vaccine could stimulate a T cell response in infants. Vaccine was licensed in 1989 as Hotez was finishing his training. By the time he was a junior attending at Yale Children’s Hospital 2 years later, the disease was gone. It’s very expensive to get a vaccine approved. Committees consider health benefits, cost effectiveness, etc. Hotez says it’s clear that Hib vaccine was necessary. No vaccine is given for a trivial reason whether it’s apparent or not. There may have been enough at risk populations that it made sense to vaccinate everyone. The Hep B vaccine is very low risk: a recombinant protein vaccine produced in yeast that’s been around for almost four decades and been given to hundreds of millions of children. Hotez says another way to think about it is: what are we losing by vaccinating infants? (i.e., what’s the downside?)",

Particularly with the regressive form of autism, kids actually lose milestones they had reached and parents remember that they got vaccine around that time. But you can go back much earlier and show brain changes in infancy or even prenatally. Eric Courchesne at UCSD and researchers at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT have identified about a hundred genes linked to autism spectrum disorder.

Previously it had been called pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) and many affected children were macrocephalic (had enlarged heads), so it was clearly a neuroanatomical condition. It had to be prenatal, but he did not think immunization during pregnancy would be the cause and this was later confirmed. In Rachel’s case, it’s not her autism but her intellectual disability that’s incapacitating. Special services are an issue when children become adults and there is no long-term plan for Rachel right now.",

  "content": "In 2020, it was estimated that 1 in 54 American children will have autism. Hotez says could be more like 1 in 30 if girls and women aren’t undercounted. It was much more rare in, say, 1980 because the criteria changed. Used to focus on nonverbal boys with certain repetitive behaviors, has now greatly expanded. Also a question about at what point neurodiversity becomes a DSM diagnosis. Hotez believes that the rising incidence of autism is due to better awareness and an expansion of the definition. We now realize that kids who might have been labelled “mentally retarded” in another era are on the autism spectrum. In addition, having an autism diagnosis allows a child to access special services that they would not otherwise be eligible for, so there may be a tendency to seek the diagnosis. And girls are now being diagnosed more as better awareness that it can look different in females. It’s unclear how heritable autism is. Some may be spontaneous mutations, others not. It is common to see undiagnosed parents with autistic traits. There’s a theory that it’s more common among highly intelligent people, but this has not been established.",

People are living longer and there are many more tools to make the diagnosis, but also other factors that may be increasing the incidence. For example, vascular disease and metabolic disease are rising, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels increase and get more neuropathology. David Corry at Baylor and Hotez are collaborating with others on a project to look at fungal (and even candida) involvement in AD. Some beta amyloid plaques have fungal sequences. Looking at the role of aspergillus and yeast-forming fungi. Peter suspects AD is the final common path for many health problems. There might also be a toxic version related to infectious agents or environmental toxins. Hotez says researchers are looking at whether a fungal vaccine could help reduce neurodegenerative disease.",

  "content": "A group at Geisinger in Pennsylvania has been looking at a number of psychiatric conditions. Researchers identified groups of families that have the same genetic mutation, yet one individual has autism, another schizophrenia, and another some other kind of brain disorder. Genetics is dominant, but epigenetic factors could play a role, likely occurring during pregnancy. Structural changes in the brain are already well underway before birth. Work from Courchesne and others shows that this is going on in fetal brain development (maybe as late as the second trimester, but in utero). Environmental influences are most likely something occurring during pregnancy. Peter says this adds to the anxiety about the baby’s health many parents feel during pregnancy. Rachel’s case seemed to be caused by a single gene, but the Broad Institute paper identified about a hundred genes. All are involved in early fetal brain development, all but one are in the cortex of the brain, most related to early excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and many affect the neuronal cytoskeleton. The genes are dominant, but there might be epigenetic influences that can affect whether it’s full-on expression of autism or schizophrenia. “I think it’s overwhelmingly the genetics is the dominant factor and yes, deterministic, and maybe there are some epigenetic influences”.",

Pfizer just released data showing 100% efficacy in adolescents 12 to 15. Virus neutralizing antibody titers in the adolescents were much higher than in older adults.

Virus neutralizing antibody titers are very high after two doses and it will offer as much protection as Pfizer and Moderna. Single dose J&J might be slightly better than a single dose Pfizer and Moderna. We will likely need a booster for all of them (third dose of Moderna or Pfizer or second dose of the J&J). Will elevate virus neutralizing antibody titers and create more durability of protection. May need to reconfigure the boosters to cover the South African and Brazilian variants which are not yet common in the US.
