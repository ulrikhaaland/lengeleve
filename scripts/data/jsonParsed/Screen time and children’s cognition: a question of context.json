  "content": "When it comes to the question of television and other on-screen media, nearly everyone seems to agree on the healthy, “correct” answer: screen time is bad for early child development. However, a narrative review argues that, in the right context, screen exposure may have no negative effects on – and may even show some benefits for – various aspects of cognitive development, including language learning, imitation, executive function, IQ, and attention. Allowing infants and toddlers to view educational programming specifically designed for these ages is associated with better subsequent cognitive metrics than allowing children to view entertainment programming or programming intended for older audiences. Interaction with others appears to enhance the perceived salience of on-screen information, unlocking a child’s ability to learn from a medium which would otherwise offer no real-world benefit. Despite the possible benefits of certain kinds of on-screen content, live social interactions and physical play still appear to be more effective forms of learning and cannot be replaced by even the most educational television shows.",

  "content": "When it comes to screen time for young children, context matters. There’s some evidence that certain programs might have benefits, but maybe rethink using television as background entertainment while cooking dinner. If you need a babysitter, a trusted human is a far better choice than digital platforms. And whenever possible, when your toddler is watching a show, take a seat alongside and engage with them. Whether screen time has a net positive, negative, or neutral influence on very young children is a question loaded with nuance, and the answers aren’t entirely clear, but if one point seems certain, it’s that a screen is no substitute for human interaction.",
