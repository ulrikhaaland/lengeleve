The good news is that it doesn’t look nearly as catastrophic as it seemed in mid-March. The numbers of new cases and new deaths seem to be plateauing and even declining (slightly) in hotspots such as New York City.",

  "content": "Let’s start with the early predictions that many people, myself included, found beyond frightening, but also at least somewhat plausible. Those predictions were produced by epidemiological models that used as inputs various properties assumed to be known about the virus, most importantly how readily it spread between people and how harmful it was to those who acquired it. And while these models varied wildly in their predicted outcomes—from 200,000 to more than 2 million deaths in the United States—they all have one thing in common, which is that the way things stand now, they appear wrong.",

Now, six weeks later, we are still in the dark because we didn’t do the broad testing that we should have done back then.

That’s why they are important, and why it is so important that those models a) accept uncertainty, and b) are based on the best data we can obtain. The model is not a prophet. It is simply a tool to help us understand the biology of what is happening, and to help us figure out what we have to do next.",
