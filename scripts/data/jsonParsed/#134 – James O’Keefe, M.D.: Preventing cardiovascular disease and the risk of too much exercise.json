In a well trained athlete, intense exercise will increase heart rate by about three-fold, say 45 to 170 bpm for example. The volume of blood being pumped, however, increases by about six-fold (5 to 30+ liters per minute). Increased cardiac output, or the volume of blood pumped per beat, explains this discrepancy. For cardiac output to increase, the internal volume of the heart must also increase. With extreme amounts of exercise, this stretching of the heart can be problematic.",
