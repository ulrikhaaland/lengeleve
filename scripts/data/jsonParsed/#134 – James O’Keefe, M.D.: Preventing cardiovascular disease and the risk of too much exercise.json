The association with decreased brain cholesterol with dementia is a good reason to considering alternatives to statin therapy (including a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids).

If someone has a low 10-year risk calculation but has high ApoB, current recommendations are to do nothing beyond lifestyle modifications. Based on the work of Allan Sniderman, Peter thinks it is more important to look at 30- or 40- year risk. James notes that ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors are actually preferable to statins in this context because statins can accelerate coronary artery calcification. Peter personally takes a low dose pravastatin plus PCSK9 inhibitor, but is considering doing the experiment of switching to from pravastatin over to Zetia to see what changes. Peter notes his calcium score of 6 at age 36. James thinks that the high volume of high intensity exercise also played a role. Peter has since decreased his calcium score to 0. James says you virtually never see scores go down—he has read about 150,000 calcium scores and considers this rare – calcium score usually increases by 25-30% or more per year. In one of James’ patients, however, he saw a calcium score over 1,000 drop by 200-300 after switching from statins to ezetimibe plus a PCSK9 inhibitor. A recent study showed that using a PCSK9 inhibitor with a statin results in less coronary artery calcification than a statin alone. Peter and James agree that re-testing calcium score is generally not necessary. Although it may serve as motivation for patients who are not following recommendations, it can be discouraging for patients who are doing everything right. “…we can prevent cardiovascular events with all these strategies we’re talking about, despite the coronary calcium.”",

  "content": "Evidence for high dose EPA and DHA for the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk. Similar to other nutrients, James notes that we’re eating less omega-3 fatty acids than our evolutionary ancestors, maybe by an order of magnitude. Some people believe that access to shellfish and seafood corresponded with human brain expansion 300,000-400,000 years ago. About twenty percent of the brain’s dry weight is made of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from neuron membranes. The REDUCE-IT trial showed 4 g/d of a purified form of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to decrease cardiovascular deaths and events in people with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or risk factors including high triglycerides by 20%. Another recent trial, the EVAPORATE study, showed 4 g/d of the same purified form of EPA to decrease coronary plaque by 17%. The STRENGTH trial, however, looked at the effects of 4 g/d of a fish oil derivative including EPA+DHA on cardiovascular outcomes and was terminated early due to expected lack of effect. A recent meta-analysis of 40 studies found EPA+DHA to decrease cardiovascular death and events. Risk of fatal myocardial infarction was decreased by 35%. Overall risk decreased by 5.8% for each additional gram per day of EPA+DHA (max dose evaluated was less than 6 g). James believes that dosage is important – 2 to 4 g/d produces impressive results while most studies that fail to find benefit have used lower doses. Although it is not clearly known if EPA is better alone or in combination with DHA, James believes it is logical to include DHA based on its role in the brain and that we consumed EPA and DHA together throughout our evolutionary history.",

  "content": "James simply “followed his heart” and says that he loves what he does to the extent that he would still do it without pay. For people aspiring to be medical professionals who focus on prevention, James advises that it does not have to be all or nothing – you can be involved in the more standard and reactive aspects of medicine, such as angioplasty and lipid lowering, but you can limit this to just a portion of your focus. James also points out that working in a large medical group makes it easier for him to carve out his own niche. James believes that prevention will become a more important part of medicine as more people realize the payoff in regard to getting more out of life.",
