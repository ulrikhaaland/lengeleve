  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The Annals of Internal Medicine published 6 papers investigating the impact of unprocessed red meat and processed meat on cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality. Red meat was defined as mammalian meat, and processed meat was defined as white or red meat preserved by smoking, curing, salting, or adding preservatives. The investigators recommended that adults continue eating the current levels of red and processed meat while acknowledging that this was a weak recommendation, based on evidence that provides little certainty. The evidence for adverse outcomes associated with meat consumption is too weak to recommend reducing its consumption.",

  "content": "The recommendation faced criticism from public health authorities who have previously taken a hard line on meat avoidance. The perspective points to financial ties to industry as the exclusive conflict of interest, whether pro- or anti-meat. Nonfinancial conflicts of interest these authors have in terms of their ideological, intellectual, and allegiance biases are often not discussed.",
