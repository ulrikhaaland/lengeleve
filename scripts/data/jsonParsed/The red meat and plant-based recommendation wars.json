  "content": "The Annals of Internal Medicine published 6 papers by the same group of investigators investigating the impact of unprocessed red meat and processed meat on cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality. This group of investigators ultimately recommended that adults continue eating the current levels of red and processed meat while acknowledging that this was a “weak recommendation,” based on evidence that provides little certainty.",

  "content": "The recommendation faced criticism from public health authorities who have previously taken a hard line on meat avoidance. Rather than repeat myself on the limitations of nutritional epidemiology and the behind-the-scenes ridiculousness that is going on with groups that are supposedly promoting good health and science, I highly suggest you read the perspective in JAMA, the Annals papers (at least the recommendations paper), and the HSPH’s response to the recommendations.",

  "content": "In a viewpoint in JAMA, David Ludwig and his colleagues provide some suggestions for improving the quality of dietary research that I think make sense. I can’t help but agree with people like John Ioannidis who argue (as he did in JAMA) the field of nutritional epidemiology needs radical reform.",
