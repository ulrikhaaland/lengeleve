The regular observational epidemiology, now that assays more accurately measure Lp(a). Mendelian randomization studies that are effectively nature’s randomized experiments. The effect of LPA variants on cardiovascular disease are explained by higher Lp(a) levels.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Over the past decade, there have been 3 different types of commercial assays for measuring Lp(a). The first is Lp(a) cholesterol content; measured cholesterol of LDLs that had apolipoprotein(a) on them. The cholesterol within certain lipoprotein does not necessarily tell you a lot of information about the number of particles that are in the bloodstream, which is the most important thing to measure if you want to estimate risk. The second is most labs report mg/dL of Lp(a); they are simply telling you the mass of Lp(a). Measuring the mass of the Lp(a) particle is much better than measuring the cholesterol in Lp(a) particles. The third is to find a lab that will give you an Lp(a) measurement in nanomoles per liter. If you have an Lp(a) measurement in mg/dL and it puts you in a high-risk range (an Lp(a) level above 50), then the chances of the Lp(a) assay that will give you a result in nmol/L will also give you a high level.",

  "content": "Lp(a) remains remarkably stable over time, so most guidelines tell you to measure it once in a lifetime. Lp(a) levels above 50-60 mg/dl are associated with increased risk of CVD. Lp(a) is something we measure to determine risk, after which point we don’t need to measure it; now you need to take measures elsewhere.",
