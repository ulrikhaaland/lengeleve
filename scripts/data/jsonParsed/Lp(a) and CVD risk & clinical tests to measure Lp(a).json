Benoît adds a 3rd assumption, that the effect of LPA variants on cardiovascular disease are explained by higher Lp(a) levels.",

  "content": "Over the past decade, Peter has seen 3 different types of commercial assays for measuring Lp(a). Most labs report mg/dL of Lp(a); they are simply telling you the mass of Lp(a). Measuring the mass of the Lp(a) particle is much better than measuring the cholesterol in Lp(a) particles. What you really want to do is try to find a lab that will give you an Lp(a) measurement in nanomoles per liter. Lp(a) levels above 50-60 mg/dl are associated with increased risk of CVD.",
