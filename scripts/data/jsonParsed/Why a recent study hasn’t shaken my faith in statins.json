  "content": "A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine suggested that lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins confers at best only “modest” benefit to patients. The study reviewed and analyzed data from 21 randomized clinical trials designed to investigate the efficacy of statins in reducing all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes including myocardial infarction and stroke. The authors reported an absolute risk reduction of 0.8% for all-cause mortality, 1.3% for myocardial infarction, and 0.4% for stroke among patients randomized to receive statin treatment compared to placebo or usual care.",

  "content": "The study has several shortcomings. First, it used LDL-C as the relevant variable for linking statin efficacy to clinical outcomes, yet LDL-C is not an ideal metric for determining the atherogenic risk. The most reliable risk-associated variable is the concentration of apolipoprotein B (apoB), the protein that associates with LDL particles. Another more reliable variable than LDL-C is non-high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. Second, the average treatment duration of 4.4 years across included trials is almost certainly too short to show the full potential effect of LDL-C reductions on cardiovascular risk and mortality. Lastly, the degree of LDL-C reduction was not considered. The efficacy of interventions is a function of two variables: time and magnitude.",

  "content": "Far from shaking up conventional wisdom about statins and the relationship between LDL and CV risk, last month’s study adds very little to our understanding of these therapies and their mechanisms. While we have a responsibility to question existing practices and, if warranted, revise therapeutic approaches, the data from this study do not provide justification for such revision, despite rampant – and potentially deadly – insinuations to the contrary in popular press and social media.",
