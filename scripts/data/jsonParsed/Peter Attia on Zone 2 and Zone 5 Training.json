  "content": "Optimizing exercise for longevity is different than optimizing for performance. Training at an energy system that is very demanding of the cardiovascular system, such as running a fast 10k, is past the point of optimizing longevity returns and can actually come at some cost to longevity. Instead, training for longevity involves focusing on the main energy systems of life: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 5. By training zone 2 and zone 5, weâ€™re structuring ourselves metabolically and structurally for longevity.",

  "title": "Zone 2 Training for Longevity",
  "date": "February 8, 2022",
  "context": "High Intensity & Zone 5 Training",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Zone 2 is the highest level of exertion that is effectively pure mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation before you start to net accumulate lactate. Zone 2 training can be done about four times per week, using a lactate meter to ensure the limit of exertion is not exceeded. This can be done on a stationary bike, treadmill, or an elliptical. For beginners, around 2 hours a week is a good place to start, but ideally, 3-4 hours per week should be dedicated to Zone 2 training.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Zone 5 is a high intensity zone and the fourth and final piece of exercise. While not much time needs to be spent in Zone 5, neglecting it completely can have negative effects on longevity. High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is more efficient when compared to aerobic exercise on a minute per minute or unit time basis. However, using both aerobic exercise and HIIT is optimal for longevity.",
