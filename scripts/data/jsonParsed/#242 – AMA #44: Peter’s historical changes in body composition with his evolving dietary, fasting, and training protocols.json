It's very accurate at measuring fat, and total body fat divided by total body weight gives your body fat percentage. It's recommended to get DEXA scans at least once a year.",

Second, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), which is one of the compartments of fat that is outside of the subcutaneous stores. Third, bone mineral density, which is important for diagnosing conditions like osteopenia and osteoporosis. Fourth, metrics of muscle mass, including appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI).",
