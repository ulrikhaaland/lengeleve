Peter’s response using himself as an example: Lipids. Pay attention to lipids, both advanced and simple lipids. Triglycerides. TGs are always something he’s paying a lot of attention to. Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin response, homocysteine, C-reactive protein. Also during keto days, his fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin response, homocysteine, C-reactive protein were all in good shape. He didn’t pay too much attention to hormones at that time, but he doesn’t recall any issues. Testosterone. Post residency (before keto days), he has really, really low testosterone (5th percentile). After he began his health journey, his free testosterone bounced back in a big way, solidly into the 30th to 40th percentile. Uric acid. One number that was persistently elevated back in the keto days, was his uric acid which was “through the roof”. He didn’t really understand why at the time, but today he would argue that that’s probably because beta hydroxybutyrate is competing for the same transporter in the kidney that uric acid is.

By 2021, Peter is on a maximally suppressive lipid regimen. He’s taking a PCSK9 inhibitor and a statin, effectively obliterating his apoB levels. There would undoubtedly be some fluctuation in apoB as a result of dietary changes, but it’s not really showing up. And the lipid markers that are a better indicator of fuel partitioning—HDL-C, triglycerides—are not really changing.

But in the summer of 2021, he added blood flow restriction (BFR) to his workouts (see episode #179 with Jeremy Loenneke). For nutrition, he really started to eat even more calories with the idea that he’s going to allow himself to gain weight and hope the majority of that will be lean muscle. Then in February 2022, he realizes he’s going to need shoulder surgery the next month (March). So he’s actually now doing prehab for shoulder surgery—still exercising just as hard, but he’s preparing himself to have that surgery. Prior to surgery, he gets another DEXA scan on 2/10/22. Total body weight: 187 pounds. Heaviest he’s been in a long, long time. His lean mass has gone up to 152.9 lbs (increase of 8.5 lbs). His fat mass increased by about 2 lbs. Even though he’s gained 10 pounds, his body fat % stayed about the same—the reason is, of course, his fat mass and lean mass increased in proportion to each other at the same body fat. Interestingly, his VAT is now up to 500 grams (now a little bit below the 10th percentile). So VAT went from basically being undetectable (3rd percentile) to the 10th percentile. Note that Peter’s goal for his patients is for VAT to be at or below the 10th percentile. Peter’s ALMI is 95th to 97th percentile and FFMI is above the 97th line.

The net effect of that bug was it really suppressed his appetite, but also his intense training went down and that has an appetite suppressing effect. 2 – But the other big thing that happened was he couldn’t carry heavy things.
