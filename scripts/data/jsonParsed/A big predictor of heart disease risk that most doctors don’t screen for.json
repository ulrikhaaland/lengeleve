Unfortunately, the paper is currently behind a paywall, but if you visit the link you can listen to a 30-minute summary. Here’s a good article discussing the paper. Will be exploring this topic in-depth soon. The timing was also perfect because my close friend Anahad O’Connor published this piece on Lp(a) in the NYT.",
