  "content": "Regular physical activity is one of the most important things people can do to improve their health according to the national physical activity guidelines. Exercise is associated with the reduction in risk of many adverse conditions, including metabolic dysregulation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Exercise is also associated with a lower risk of chronic lung disease, as well as with a lower risk of frailty and the debilitating or deadly falls and injuries that accompany it. Exercise might be the most potent “drug” we have for extending the quality and perhaps quantity of our years of life.",

  "title": "Generation 100 Study on Exercise and Mortality",
  "date": "November 28, 2021",
  "context": "Weekly Emails",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Researchers from Norway conducted a five-year study to test the effect of exercise and mortality in adults in their seventies living in the city of Trondheim. More than 1,500 participants in this study were randomized into one of three groups: a control group, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). After five years, just under 5% of the participants assigned to the control group had died, while the mortality rates in participants assigned to the HIIT and MICT groups were about 3% and 6%, respectively. The combined mortality rate of the HIIT and MICT participants was 4.5%.",

  "content": "Given the results, should we conclude that exercise has no effect on all-cause mortality? The recommendations also add that the amount of daily activity needed to avoid weight gain is about 60 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or a somewhat shorter duration of vigorous-intensity activity. The control group was compared to a HIIT and MICT group, which were essentially asked to follow the same recommendations as the control group three days out of the week. HIIT and MICT groups only differed from controls in that they were asked to exchange two of the 30-minute moderate-intensity physical activity sessions each week with two days of HIIT and MICT sessions, respectively.",

  "content": "Essentially, the study compared people asked to exercise regularly with people asked to exercise regularly with occasional supervision. The investigators acknowledged the high level of physical activity in the control group, “which probably reduced the study’s ability to detect statistically significant effects of exercise training on primary outcomes.” The researchers suggest the use of new study designs for further investigation, presumably designs in which the control group is less active than they were in this published study. The bottom line is that the control group is completely inappropriate from the standpoint of trying to determine cause and effect in this study.",
