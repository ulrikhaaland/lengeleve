  "content": "Regular physical activity is one of the most important things people can do to improve their health according to the national physical activity guidelines. Exercise is associated with the reduction in risk of many adverse conditions, including the four horsemen of chronic disease: metabolic dysregulation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Exercise is also associated with a lower risk of chronic lung disease, as well as with a lower risk of frailty and the debilitating or deadly falls and injuries that accompany it. In other words, exercise is associated with a lower risk of the conditions that kill the majority of US adults over the age of 40. Exercise might be the most potent “drug” we have for extending the quality and perhaps quantity of our years of life.",

  "content": "Researchers from Norway conducted a five-year study to test the effect of exercise and mortality in adults in their seventies living in the city of Trondheim. More than 1,500 participants in this study were randomized into one of three groups: a control group, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT).",

  "content": "About half of the participants were assigned to the control group and were asked to follow the Norwegian physical activity guidelines for 2012, which recommends 30 minutes of moderate-level physical activity almost every day. The other half of participants were assigned to the HIIT or MICT groups. Participants in the HIIT group were asked to exchange two of the five 30-minute moderate-intensity physical activity sessions each week (as recommended by Norwegian health authorities) with two “4-by-4” HIIT sessions, consisting of a 10-minute warm-up followed by four four-minute intervals at approximately 90% peak heart rate with three minutes of active recovery (about 60% of peak heart rate) in between. Participants in the MICT group were asked to exchange two of the five guideline-recommended 30-minute moderate-intensity physical activity sessions each week with two MICT sessions, consisting of 50 minutes of continuous work at about 70% of peak heart rate.",

  "content": "After five years, just under 5% of the participants assigned to the control group had died, while the mortality rates in participants assigned to the HIIT and MICT groups were about 3% and 6%, respectively. The combined mortality rate of the HIIT and MICT participants was 4.5%. The investigators concluded that combined MICT and HIIT has no effect on all-cause mortality compared with recommended physical activity levels, but they did observe a lower all-cause mortality trend in the participants assigned to HIIT compared with those assigned to MICT and controls.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The control group was not suitable to find out if exercise directly affects lifespans. The investigators acknowledged the high level of physical activity in the control group, which probably reduced the study’s ability to detect statistically significant effects of exercise training on primary outcomes. The Hawthorne effect refers to the alteration of behavior by the participants of a study due to their awareness of being observed. The control group is completely inappropriate from the standpoint of trying to determine cause and effect in this study.",
