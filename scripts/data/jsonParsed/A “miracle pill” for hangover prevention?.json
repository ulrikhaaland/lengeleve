  "content": "Myrkl hangover pills contain L-cysteine, vitamin B12, and two probiotics: bacillus subtilis and bacillus coagulans. L-cysteine covalently binds to acetaldehyde, creating a stable compound, which reduces the toxicity of acetaldehyde, the byproduct of alcohol metabolism that is thought to contribute to hangover symptoms. The inclusion of the two probiotics may increase your metabolic rate of alcohol and its byproducts, reducing BAC and less alcohol absorption. However, the increased rate of elimination of alcohol and acetaldehyde may help reduce hangovers, but this effect comes at the expense of the alcohol-induced “buzz.”",
