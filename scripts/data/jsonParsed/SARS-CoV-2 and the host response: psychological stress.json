  "content": "There are two major drivers of infection by, and complications of, SARS-CoV-2: (1) pre-existing immunity and (2) host factors rendering one more, or less, susceptible to damage from the virus. Pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is a topic being explored actively and, should it exist, one hypothesis is that it is mediated by previous exposure to other beta coronaviruses with the potential for cross-reactivity with the coronavirus of interest today. There are many host factors beyond pre-existing immunity that can render some people more, or less, susceptible to damage from the virus, but broadly can be separated into two major factors, those that are resilience-mediated and those that are immune-mediated. Exercise, for example—a physiological stressor—is related to both enhancement and diminution of the immune system, depending on the context. Moderate exercise appears to enhance the immune system and lower the risk of infections.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Psychological stress—when psychological distress exceeds a person’s ability to cope—can suppress resistance to infection. The rates of colds—which can be interpreted as the incidence of symptomatic infections—increased in a dose-response manner with increases in the stress-index score. The rates of infection overall—symptomatic or asymptomatic—also increased in a similar fashion. Higher levels of stress were associated with more than 2-fold risk of symptomatic infection, and nearly a 6-fold risk of overall infection. Higher levels of stress were highly associated with more infections, overall, and more symptomatic infections (colds).",

  "content": "Lowering psychological stress can reduce the risk of disease, both physical and mental. If psychological stress is a modifiable factor, the question becomes, how do we modify it in a favorable way? Practices to help manage psychological stress include consistent physical exercise, mindfulness or meditation, and talking to a mental health professional to see if there’s trauma being left untreated.",
