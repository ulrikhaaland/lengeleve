  "content": "I’ve been thinking a lot about psychological stress and how it relates to our response to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Can psychological stress—when psychological distress exceeds a person’s ability to cope—suppress resistance to infection? In a classic New England Journal of Medicine paper from 1991, Sheldon Cohen and two of his colleagues tried to answer this question by conducting the following experiment. A JAMA letter published this week, suggests that psychological distress (and loneliness) is on the rise.",

  "date": "June 7, 2020",
  "context": "COVID-19",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Broadly speaking there are two major drivers of infection by, and complications of, SARS-CoV-2: (1) pre-existing immunity and (2) host factors rendering one more, or less, susceptible to damage from the virus. There are many host factors beyond pre-existing immunity that can render some people more, or less, susceptible to damage from the virus, but broadly can be separated into two major factors, those that are resilience-mediated and those that are immune-mediated. Resilience-mediated factors may include the number and location of ACE2 receptors, pre-existing pulmonary reserve, endothelial function, and chronic inflammatory states—such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

  "content": "Nearly 400 healthy subjects, aged 18 to 54 were given nasal drops containing one of five respiratory viruses—rhinovirus type 2, 9, or 14, respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus type 229E—in doses intended to resemble what we generally see with person-to-person transmission. An additional 26 subjects were given saline nasal drops as a placebo. Starting two days before the viral challenge and continuing through six days after the challenge, subjects were quarantined in apartments—alone or with one or two others—and monitored daily for the development of symptoms of clinical colds. Approximately 28 days after the challenge, a serum sample was collected for serologic testing.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The rates of colds—which can be interpreted as the incidence of symptomatic infections—increased in a dose-response manner with increases in the stress-index score, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.98 when comparing the highest and lowest quartile groups. The rates of infection overall—symptomatic or asymptomatic—also increased in a similar fashion, with an OR of 3.45. After adjusting for confounders, ORs were 2.16 and 5.81 for the rates of colds and infections, respectively, meaning that when the investigators tried to control for variables that could bias the results, the associations became larger: higher levels of stress were associated with more than 2-fold risk of symptomatic infection, and nearly a 6-fold risk of overall infection.",
