  "content": "The recent Consumer Reports piece discussed per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) test results from 47 bottled waters. PFAS are a synthetic class of chemicals that include perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). They have been used for industrial purposes in the US since the 1940s. They remain in the body for a long time (they have a half-life of approximately 4 years). PFOA, also called C8, is an industrial surfactant that is used to manufacture many products such as carpeting and textiles. One study found that there is a “more probable than not” association between PFOA and 6 ailments: kidney cancer, testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, hypercholesterolemia, and pregnancy-induced hypertension. PFOS is a toxin used in stain repellents like Scotchgard. Higher levels have been associated with preeclampsia, thyroid hormone changes, and high cholesterol.",

  "title": "Regulations and Guidelines for PFAS",
  "date": "October 11, 2020",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There are no federal standards for levels of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water. The EPA has issued health advisories but not regulations, per se. It says that the combined amounts for these two compounds should be below 70 ppt, but other agencies like the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) submitted regulatory guidelines at far lower levels (3 ppt for PFOA and 2 ppt for PFOS) than the EPA’s limit. Separate guidelines are issued by a few states that have set their own more stringent limits that range from 12 to 20 ppt. The International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) holds that bottled water should have PFAS levels below 5 ppt for any single compound and 10 ppt for more than one.",

  "title": "PFAS in Topo Chico",
  "date": "October 11, 2020",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The amount of PFAS in Topo Chico is well below the 70 ppt from the EPA health advisory for maximum amounts in drinking and also below the more stringent state standards of 12-20 ppt. However, it is almost twice the amount of the IBWA standard of 5 ppt. Many studies that have been done suggest an association between PFAS and human illness but, much of the data is not statistically significant or it is based on observational data from small, non-representative populations. Because PFAS remains in the body for very long periods of time and because there is reasonable evidence that exposure is dangerous, it is wise to err on the side of caution and cut down on consumption to a few bottles a week.",
