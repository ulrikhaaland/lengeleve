  "content": "Research background is in understanding the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and aortic stenosis in relation to lifestyle and inherited risk factors. This includes extensive research in unraveling the role of Lp(a), HDL metabolism, PCSK9, and lipid-lowering therapies. About 20% of the world’s population is in the high risk category of Lp(a). Lp(a) is the single highest, genetically inherited trait that confers high risk of ASCVD. It is important to understand Lp(a) because even if you don’t have an elevated Lp(a), chances are someone you know does. The discussion includes the basic biology of Lp(a), the epidemiology of it, how it is inherited and how it is measured, how it impacts things besides ASCVD, such as aortic stenosis and myocardial infarction, the importance of measuring Lp(a) in order to target other risk factors of ASCVD, and how to manage lipid management for those who have high Lp(a). It also covers what we know about possible current therapies and treatments for Lp(a), including Niacin, Statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, as well as what’s possibly on the horizon with antisense oligonucleotides.",
