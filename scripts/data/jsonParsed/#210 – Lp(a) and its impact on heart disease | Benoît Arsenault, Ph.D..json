Now, they’re sending in signals that will drive pro-inflammatory, maybe pro-thrombotic, and pro-calcifying signals to these cells.

Peter notes that niacin raises HDL but the outcome trials are clear that this does not translate into a benefit. This makes him think about CETP inhibitors, they also cause HDL cholesterol to go up. But with this there were cases where more events were observed. Usually there was no effect or benefit of increasing HDL. This points to the complexity of HDL biology and how much we don’t understand. We don’t have an assay for HDL functionality. The amount of cholesterol in an HDL particle tells us nothing about how the HDL actually works. You can have high cholesterol in an HDL particle because of all the cholesterol that’s entering it, or you could have high cholesterol in an HDL particle because not much cholesterol is leaving it.",

  "content": "Back to Lp(a), reductions that would be beneficial and the time needed to see this benefit. In the case of Lp(a), it’s a little more confusing because niacin inhibits the production of Lp(a). What LDL and Lp(a) are doing to hurt you is easier to understand than what HDL is doing to help you. Peter asks, “So why do you think there is not a more clear signal between the use of niacin and the reduction of events?” The Mendelian randomization studies have been very clear that you will need a very large reduction in Lp(a) to produce cardiovascular benefits. The first study Benoît mentioned provides only modeling, no trial data. It estimates that you would need 100 mg/dL reduction in Lp(a) to get a benefit in a trial to be comparable to a stating treatment. Around a 20% reduction. It’s hard to estimate the time needed to get this reduction. The problem with looking at Mandalian randomization studies, you’re looking at primary prevention and at a lifelong reduction. This makes it hard to estimate the time needed for a trial to show benefit. One study showed that a 100 mg/dL reduction over a lifetimes was needed to take the mortality curve down to the next rung. Another study suggested 50 mg/dL, a 20% reduction was needed. But still over the course of one’s lifetime. With the statin trials, they have between 2-7years of treatment in patients that already have disease. So you cannot really compare apple and oranges. That’s obviously a caveat of those studies because you’re trying to estimate the results of a trial using lifelong effects.",

  "content": "With CETP inhibitors, there is evidence, at least for the anacetrapib, that it might lead to cardiovascular benefit. This is the Merk drug. They stopped the trial even though it was trending in a positive direction. One reason for that was that they saw a lot of drug accumulation in adipose tissue, which is not something you want, if you want to prescribe a lifelong treatment. Secondly, the treatment effect was not spectacularly high, maybe a 6% reduction in the rate of events. This was a revealed trial. It was stopped maybe 2-3 years ago. It was a big trial with 30,000 patients; big trials are needed. So what they showed is that it was the reduction in the number of apoB lipoproteins that actually mattered. “The risk was not proportional to the HDL rising effect; it was proportional to the apoB lowering effect”— Benoît Arsenault. If you plot all the clinical trials together, if you plot the apoB lowering effect to the reduction in cardiovascular disease, you can see that all these trials line perfectly on the line. Even that specific trial with anacetrapib, it fell right on the line. Same with PCSK9 inhibitors, same with ezetimibe, any LDL lowering drug that’s out there, maybe a few exceptions, but it will land on this line. So it’s really not about HDL so much. “It just further convinced us to hit on apoB containing lipoproteins as hard as we can”— Benoît Arsenault. Peter laments about the fact that we even have apoB.

  "content": "PCSK9 inhibitors are so effective in lowering apoB because they’re mimicking the most extreme loss of function of this gene; it’s taking away PCSK9 that does 3 things to reduce LDL clearance. Why don’t statins lower Lp(a)? Because Lp(a) levels are determined by their rate of production. One of the players that was unanticipated in Lp(a)/ apo(a) production is PCSK9. If you incubate liver cells with PCSK9, you’ll see the expression of apo(a) going up, and in lipoprotein turnover studies, you also see that. If you treat people with PCSK9 inhibitor, you will actually see a reduction in the production rate of apo(a). There was a nice study that showed this (though complex) by Gerald Watts in Perth, Australia. He also showed in a second group that if you treat patients with a PCSK9 inhibitor and the statin, you can actually see clearance of or increased fractional catabolic rate of Lp(a). Benoît notes, “There’s still so much that we don’t know in this area, and it’s not totally clear why we see this difference of PCSK9 inhibitors that’s depending on whether or not you’re treated with a statin”. PCSK9 inhibitors lower Lp(a) by 25-30%, but the variability is enormous. The variability is very important, and it’s another example where we need to study patients that have high Lp(a), because these are the patients that we want to provide an answer to. There’s only been one trial that had tested the effect of a PCSK9 inhibitor in patients with high Lp(a). There have been sub-analysis in Fourier and Odyssey outcomes and in all these post hoc analyses of PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with high Lp(a)— the reduction is 15%. In the Anitschkow trial run by Zahi Fayad at Mount Sinai in New York, and Erik Stroes in Amsterdam, they show that even though LDL is greatly reduced and there is a small reduction in Lp(a) (15%), arterial wall inflammation is not affected. Benoît’s takeaway: this means that there’s an important residual risk that’s associated with Lp(a) and we’re going to have to go after Lp(a) even in patients that have very low levels of LDL.",
