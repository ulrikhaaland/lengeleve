  "content": "This is a pretty unusual response to just lowering uric acid. But it’s also a great teaching point—Do NOT go after blood pressure until you’ve got the uric acid below 5. Only then start playing with the blood pressure medication. The broader point: Try to fix the insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome first (which in this case he didn’t have, but he did have the elevated uric acid) before you introduce drugs to treat blood pressure.",
