  "content": "There is some data in support of senescence in that cellular niche, but it’s very complicated biology. There was a large meta analysis of a genome wide association studies looking for the genetic correlation between illness of aging and loci. What you saw is that one of the very big peaks for diseases of aging maps into the control system for the establishment of cellular senescence (the p14arf locus). For type 2 diabetes… mutations that give rise to T2D live there. Mutations that give rise to late onset Alzheimer’s live their frailty lives there. Atherosclerosis lives there.",

  "content": "Your brain has many glial cells ⇒ The cells in your brain that are NOT your neurons but they hold the rest of it together. There’s a dramatic increase in senescent glial cells, specifically astrocytes and microglia. The question that needs to be studied: What would happen if you could eliminate senescent glial cells? Would that enhance cognition? Would it harm cognition? It’s hard to imagine that the pro-inflammatory environment created by this vast number of senescent glial cells is good for you. . . it would just be very hard to imagine that senescence is not playing a role in aspects of cognition loss as we age.",

There are wonderful things that you can do from the seat of academia in company creation if you are so lucky and so positioned to do so. 2—Animate what you do with a single beautiful idea. Find something that moves you, that literally gives you goosebumps. 3—Learn from people that are better than you. Find people with more experience that will have patience with you.",
