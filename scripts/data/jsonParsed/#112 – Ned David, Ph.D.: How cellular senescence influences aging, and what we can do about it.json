This led to the start of a company (Unity) that aimed to answer 4 specific questions: Do senescent cells contribute to natural aging? Could we find a disease, any human disease, that we could model in an animal where we can eliminate senescent cells and take that disease and either stop it or even better send it backwards? Could we find a molecule that could trigger the elimination of senescent cells from a living creature safely? Is getting rid of senescent cells safe?",

They decided to go with plan A because you wouldn’t have to dose the drug over and over again. In fact, you could potentially just take is one time, kill the cells, and sort of solve the issue. Many times, the “safety” of a drug becomes a problem because you have to take it a bunch, so this approach lowers that risk.",
