  "content": "Zone 2 training is defined as your highest metabolic output/work that you can sustain while keeping your lactate level below two millimole per liter (mmol/L). It is a measure of how metabolically healthy you are and how good your mitochondria are. The fitter a person is, the healthier a person is, the more work they can do with less lactate. For a given individual, we use this metric of zone 2 as a place to understand how metabolically healthy they are, how good their mitochondria are, and how much work can be done while keeping your lactate about 1.7 to 2.0 mmol/L.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The most effective ways to engage in zone 2 exercise include using a bicycle, treadmill, rowing machine, or elliptical. When doing zone 2, you want a machine where it's very easy to reproducibly produce the same output. For most people, running gets them out of zone two a little too quickly. With patients, brisk walking on an incline is preferred. You have to figure out which incline and speed will keep you, personally, in zone 2, but once you know then you can set it and go.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Training a deconditioned or metabolically ill individual can be a challenge. Someone who is very metabolically ill may be already at 2 mmol of lactate at rest. So right after they jump on the bike their lactate starts to shoot up. Essentially, they are immediately getting out of mitochondrial oxidation and they’re burning nearly all glucose instead of fat. In the beginning, rely on what’s called rate of perceived exertion (RPE). Combing that metric with heart rate and lactate and you can start to triangulate on zone 2.",

It’s a big part of maintaining the potassium concentration in the cell—An action potential requires sodium to rush in a cell and potassium to rush out of a cell. And those gradients have to be maintained. That requires electromagnetic force. Magnesium plays an important role in that.",

Magnesium L-threonate is less about the magnesium and more about what L-threonate does. L-threonate is a CNS transporter—magnesium doesn’t cross the blood brain barrier very effectively so the threonate is taking whatever magnesium you’ve got and getting it into the CNS. It’s being investigated for its potential benefits in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment and may improve sleep.",
