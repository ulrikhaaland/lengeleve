  "content": "Someone who is very metabolically ill may be already at 2 mmol of lactate at rest. So right after they jump on the bike their lactate starts to shoot up. So it becomes quite the challenge to get that person to sustain 45 minutes (recommended zone 2 dose). Essentially, they are immediately getting out of mitochondrial oxidation and they’re burning nearly all glucose instead of fat (which is not the purpose of dedicated zone 2 exercise). How would Peter go about training that person? Let’s say you take a person who’s resting lactate is 1.5 to 2.0 mmol (NOTE: Metformin will raise your resting lactate by the way). This persons mitochondria probably does not work that well. You put that person on a bike at 100 watts, their lactate could easily be 5.0 mmol in 20 minutes. What do we do with that person? How do we get that person in shape? Short answer is you just accept the fact that in the short term their lactate is going to blow past 2.0 (meaning their not in zone 2). So in the beginning, Peter would rely what’s called rate of perceived exertion (RPE). Combing that metric with heart rate and lactate and you can start to triangulate on zone 2. But the really metabolically inflexible person… It’s really an art to it sometimes you have to just rely more on RPE.",
