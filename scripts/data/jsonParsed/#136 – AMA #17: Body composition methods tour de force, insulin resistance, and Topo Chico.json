DEXA scanning also allows for the differentiation between subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat to some degree, and it involves a very trivial amount of radiation. However, hydration levels can impact the measurement, so it's important to maintain consistency in factors such as hydration level, time of day, sleep, and food eaten prior.",

However, this method requires a clear belief about how much air a person can expel from their lungs, and individuals who can't tap into that will artificially have a higher-looking body fat. Peter Attia prefers DEXA scanning over hydrostatic weighing, but he thinks it's okay and reasonable for comparison.",

Since fat is a nonconducting tissue, it opposes electrical current. In contrast, current is transferred through water by electrolytes. Therefore, passage of current through the body can be used to estimate total body water content, and with body mass can be used to estimate body fat percentage. While it is quick, easy, cheap, and has no radiation, it is not super accurate and is highly sensitive to hydration status. It can be good for seeing a trend over time.",

So when someone is insulin resistant, they will have high blood sugar after consuming carbohydrates because their muscles don’t take in glucose inefficiently because they aren’t able to respond to the signal of insulin. They’ll also likely have high levels of glucose in the morning because overnight their liver continues to make too much glucose and isn’t responding to the signal of insulin telling them to stop making it.
