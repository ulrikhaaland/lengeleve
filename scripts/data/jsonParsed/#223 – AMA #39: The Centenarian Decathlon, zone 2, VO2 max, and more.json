You’re in a lab and they’re putting a mask over your face, and they’re measuring with as much precision as is possible. This is still an inexact science of course, but they’re measuring the rate of oxygen consumption and CO2 production. Those two metrics are what allow you to calculate all the variables of interest. O2 consumption of course is all you need to calculate VO2 max. But CO2 production gives you not just how much CO2 you’re making, but it allows you to calculate the respiratory quotient, which then allows you to understand fuel partitioning and total energy expenditure. But just as with zone 2, there are other ways to estimate your VO2 max. If you have a really advanced sports watch, they’ll often have a feature on there that will sort of estimate your VO2 max based on how fast it thinks you’re moving, what your heart rate is, and then how much your heart rate recovers when you stop. Running based tests are also common such as where you run a given distance and then take the time that you ran that distance in, multiply, divide it by something and that’ll give you a VO2 max. How fast you can run a mile, assuming you’re running it all out, can be used to predict your VO2 max. And those running based tests are reasonably accurate.",

A Tabata is an interval that looks as follows: It’s about 20 seconds of all out work followed by 10 seconds of rest repeated eight times. This is the quintessential high intensity interval workout. These types of workouts absolutely increase VO2 max. Rucking also increases VO2 max. However, nothing does it better than about the four to six minute interval at about a one to one ratio of rest to recovery. This involves doing four minutes of about as hard as you can go for four minutes, followed by 4 minutes rest in between.

The amount of time this take really just comes down to how much other training do you want to put in for these other activities (strength/stability). It’s pretty hard to get there below 75 [MET hours per week}, if you’re going to devote 60 [MET hours per week} to your cardiorespiratory fitness.",

  "content": "There’s no area in which compounding plays a greater role than in this arena. It’s even more relevant than in wealth accumulation. If you start saving at 25, it’s a very different proposition than if you start saving at 45 or 55, if your goal is to retire at 65. But the reality of it is with exercise there is no lottery equivalent. There is no inheritance of money or equivalent. Everybody is on the same footing. Everybody is going to have to grind their way through the savings return compounded over time formula to get the benefits when they’re done. Time, intensity, and specificity are going to be necessary components to give you the optionality to be able to be as physically active as possible when you’re in the final decade of your life.",
