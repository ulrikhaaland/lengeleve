The importance of VO2 max, why it’s critical for longevity, how to improve it, and the value in starting VO2 max optimization early in life are also discussed.",

O2 consumption of course is all you need to calculate VO2 max. But CO2 production gives you not just how much CO2 you’re making, but it allows you to calculate the respiratory quotient, which then allows you to understand fuel partitioning and total energy expenditure.",
