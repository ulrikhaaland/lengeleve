Additionally, Peter dives deep into questions around VO2 max, such as why it’s critical for longevity, how to improve it, and the value in starting VO2 max optimization early in life.",

So it’s very difficult to be successful in a physical endeavor if you are not pursuing some sort of objective.

Your VO2 max, which is your maximum aerobic output, is the peak of the pyramid. If you want to have that high peak, if you want that massive engine, you have to have a huge base. 80/20 is kind of the rule of thumb, which is 80% of your time building the base, 20% shaping the peak.

So if you don’t have the technique, you’re going to hurt yourself on a rowing machine for 45 minutes. Typically Peter would suggest if people have access to a treadmill, that’s the easiest way to go. The biggest impediment to zone 2 is that it’s much easier to do indoors than outdoors and therefore it’s nowhere near as enjoyable. Walking outdoors, generally, isn’t going to cut it because for most people you need some elevation change, meaning an increase, you need to be walking uphill to make it work. For a person who is just starting, the treadmill is probably the safest and easiest. Peter likes the bike the most because it has even less impact, but again, for some people they’re so inefficient in that position that it becomes counterproductive.",

Running based tests are also common such as where you run a given distance and then take the time that you ran that distance in, multiply, divide it by something and that’ll give you a VO2 max. How fast you can run a mile, assuming you’re running it all out, can be used to predict your VO2 max. And those running based tests are reasonably accurate. Some of the machines (treadmill or a good stair climber) will tell you how many METs you’re working at.
