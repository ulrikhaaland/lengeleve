It was first discussed/measured in the 1920s by a guy named A.V. Hill. VO2 max does NOT tell you exactly how fast you can run, but it tells you what sort of aerobic engine you have to play with. The amount of oxygen reaching any given muscle cell may actually be lower. VO2 max numbers are typically reported in milliliters of oxygen per minute, per kilogram of body weight.

This is not only the highest recorded score in human history, but it’s also higher than all the rumors. However, he wasn't successful in his cycling career. The more he trained, the less efficient he got, meaning he could deliver more aerobic energy, but he used more aerobic energy in order to maintain a given pace.",

If you just take a bunch of elite athletes and you measure their VO2 max, you tend to see an inverse relationship — The people who have the highest VO2 max tend to have slightly lower, slightly worse economies. People that have the best economy, tend to have slightly worse VO2 max. There are two possible explanations for this phenomenon: You don’t tend to hit the lottery twice, meaning if you happen to have a VO2 max that’s 92, then you’re not going to have the best possible economy. The other possibility is that there’s actually a trade off—if you’re optimizing one physiological parameter it may come at the cost of the other physiological parameter.",
