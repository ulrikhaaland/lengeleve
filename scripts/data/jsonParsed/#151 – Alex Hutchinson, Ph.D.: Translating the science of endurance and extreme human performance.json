For example, the lungs, which are conventionally thought to be overbuilt and not a limitation, can in some cases be a limiting factor, especially in highly trained endurance athletes. These athletes can be limited by their ability to get enough oxygen in. Additionally, an athlete can be so fit that their heart pumps blood past the lungs so quickly that it doesn’t have time to fully stock up on oxygen, leading to exercise induced arterial hypoxemia. This is usually an issue at altitude, but in elite endurance athletes, about half of them exhibit it even at sea level. At every stage of the way, there can be limitations if anything is knocked off kilter, right down to the ability of the muscles to first extract the oxygen from the bloodstream and then to make use of it metabolically in the mitochondria.",

It would be interesting to start selectively dropping FiO2 21%, 20%, 19%, 18%, etc. Presumably if the lungs aren’t the limitation, you should still see the same absolute delta. This experiment would at least start to eliminate one of those variables, which would be FiO2 and capillary exchange, and then you start pointing to some of these other variables.",

If you’re thinking about the 90-year-old version of you in a chair—He needs to be able to get up—that gives you the motivation to do strength training. Once you stop competing in something, all this exercise stuff becomes abstract. The practice of medicine doesn’t do a great job communicating the why. Your body’s natural ability to fight off cancer when you’re fit is a much easier task than fighting cancer when you’re unfit simply based on the energetics of your immune system.",

  "content": "There has been criticism of most science journalists. Most of the articles are just sensationalized headlines and lack detail. A news story should be written with the understanding that very few people are going to go back to the primary source and read it … and this places an enormous responsibility on scientific journalism. The problem is perceived to be that journalism now follows the audience. It’s unhealthy for the news organizations to find out what people click on.",

  "content": "“To encourage good science journalism, you need people to read good science journalism.” But newspapers are realizing that following the audience has turned out to be a bad move because they’ve ended up losing the trust in audience. By giving people what they thought they wanted, you ended up basically giving them crap. And then having people recognize that they were being fed crap and then rebel against it.",

His articles started to get taken on by Runner’s World in 2012 and then moved over to Outside in 2017. So, it turned out there was an audience for that.",

The initial signals were the opposite—i.e., the less complicated it was and the more sensational it was, the more clicks they got. One possible solution: We need to move away from advertising and towards subscription-based models.",
