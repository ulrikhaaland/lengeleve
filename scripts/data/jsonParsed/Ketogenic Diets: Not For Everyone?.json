  "content": "The high-fat, very low-carbohydrate diet, also known as a ketogenic diet, may help to ameliorate metabolic syndromes like obesity and type 2 diabetes, and positively affect problematic cardiometabolic markers. However, a recent paper published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology highlights five cases in which patients had severe lipid perturbations while on the diet. These patients lost weight, but they were found to have elevated total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). These lipid perturbations were due to pre-existing conditions, some of which were identified in the paper, and the cases suggest that abnormal lipid responses to the ketogenic diet is driven, in part, by genetics.",

  "title": "Study on Genetic Factors and Diet",
  "date": "December 5, 2021",
  "context": "Ketosis",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Genetic factors can influence one’s physiologic response to diet. The ketogenic diet may interact with intrinsic factors to exacerbate underlying conditions, which may or may not be known upon starting the diet. Some patients in the study had an identified family history of cardiovascular disease, and in all cases, subjects responded to the diet with elevated TC and LDL-C. In one case, the patient had two copies of the apolipoprotein E2 gene variant, a variant associated with development of dysbetalipoproteinemia. This lipid disorder is characterized by the presence of atherogenic lipoprotein remnant particles, which are associated with significant elevations in triglycerides (TG) and calculated-LDL-C.",

  "title": "Concerns about Elevated LDL-C",
  "date": "December 5, 2021",
  "context": "Ketosis",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Elevated LDL-C is a concern for many because it is a measure of cardiovascular disease risk used in most health guidelines, including those by the American Heart Association. The LDL-C measure refers to how much cholesterol is carried in LDL particles, each of which also carries a single copy of apolipoprotein B (apoB). ApoB-containing lipoproteins transport cholesterol content into the arterial wall, which may cause plaque to develop. Given the one-to-one ratio of LDL and apoB, an apoB measure, compared to LDL-C, provides a more accurate measure of cardiovascular disease risk.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The study might have benefited from more complete clinical profiles for each subject. The investigators did not take blood measurements confirming nutritional ketosis. The study also failed to include other useful markers that would have helped create a better clinical picture and better guide for individualized corrective action. For instance, in addition to lipoprotein burden, measures of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, molecules such as uric acid and homocysteine that relate to endothelial function, and metabolic markers of insulin resistance/sensitivity and kidney function.",

  "title": "The Bottom Line",
  "date": "December 5, 2021",
  "context": "Ketosis",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Those who are starting a ketogenic diet or have experienced abnormal physiological responses to this diet can and should be tested for underlying predispositions. Collecting information to triangulate the responsible drivers of elevated LDL particles and apoB allows for appropriate diet modifications, unique to the individual. A ketogenic diet often has many metabolic benefits, even among those who respond with an increased burden of potentially atherogenic particles. In such cases, replacing dietary saturated fat or implementing lipid modulating therapies may preserve the diet’s benefits while mitigating possible cardiovascular risks. Thus, lipoprotein results should be interpreted in the context of other variables in the evaluation of metabolic health and cardiovascular risk.",
