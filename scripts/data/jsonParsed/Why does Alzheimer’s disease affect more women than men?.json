  "content": "Perimenopause is a “brain disease” and during perimenopause there are metabolic shifts in the brain that can predispose to acceleration of Alzheimer’s pathology. The disruption of sleep, the brain fog, problems with processing speed and attention, are all symptoms of perimenopause. Perimenopause transition is a huge unrealized risk factor for progression to dementia in an Alzheimer’s susceptible woman.",

Abdominal obesity: women with an enlarged waist circumference have a 39% increase in dementia risk. Interestingly, in men, muscle mass is a more important predictor than body fat, but we do not yet know why.",
