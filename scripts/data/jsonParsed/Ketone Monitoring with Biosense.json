  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Biosense uses proprietary units called ACEs, where 1 ACE is equivalent to 0.1 mmol/L of BHB. An ACE score of 5+ indicates ketosis, and the level of ACEs detected is influenced by the level of carbohydrate restriction, calorie restriction, or duration of fasting. A score of over 10 ACEs is recommended for a deeper and potentially more therapeutic state of ketosis, which can be achieved with a modified fasting approach or exercise.",
