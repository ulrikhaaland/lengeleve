  "content": "Ketogenic diets and fasting have rapidly expanded in popularity and clinical applications, and the benefits of both result, in part, from the physiological state of ketosis. The level of ketosis correlates with clinical management of many disease processes and also provides a lens into our metabolic flexibility. Ketone monitoring devices are thus powerful tools for providing actionable feedback on one’s health.",

  "context": "Ketosis",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Both ketogenic diets and fasting have the common effect of drastically limiting glucose availability in the body, which instead must then rely on fats for fuel. Insulin levels are suppressed, driving a sharp increase in fatty acid β-oxidation by liver mitochondria. Measurement of ketone bodies provides a means for quantifying the level of ketosis that an individual is experiencing. However, ketone production can vary significantly throughout the day, and based upon the current clinical trial results, it is concluded that multiple daily ketone measurements (3-5x/day) are needed to capture the full picture of daily ketone exposure.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In addition to giving rise to BHB, AcAc can alternatively be converted spontaneously to acetone, a small volatile organic compound that readily diffuses into the lungs and is expelled when we exhale. Breath acetone rises during a fast as the body mobilizes stored fat to meet its energy requirements. Numerous studies have correlated the level of breath acetone with fat loss, and elevated breath acetone while fasting indicates that your body has made the “metabolic switch” towards greater fat and ketone metabolism.",

  "content": "Readout Health developed Biosense®, which is currently the only medical-grade breath acetone device designed for tracking ketosis. The Biosense clinical trial showcased the technology and clinical data demonstrating a correlation of breath acetone with blood BHB. Compared with BHB tests, simply blowing into a Biosense device is considerably less invasive and more cost-effective. The Biosense device includes a free app with personalized ketone data and goal tracking, which is Bluetooth-enabled (when synced) and permits unlimited testing (no expensive strips needed).",

  "context": "Ketosis",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Biosense uses proprietary units called ACEs, where 1 ACE is equivalent to 0.1 mmol/L of BHB. Since nutritional ketosis is typically defined as blood BHB levels ranging from 0.5-3.0 mmol/L, an ACE score of 5+ would indicate ketosis. The level of carbohydrate restriction, calorie restriction, or duration of your fast will directly influence the levels of ACEs detected by the Biosense meter. The higher your ACE score, the deeper you are in ketosis.",
