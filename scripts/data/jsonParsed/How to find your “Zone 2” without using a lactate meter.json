  "content": "In a patient or a world class athlete you have the ability to do indirect calorimetry and lactate testing to determine Zone 2 training. But training normal people is different. The lactate measured in the blood is heavily influenced by production and clearance. The gold standard would be to measure fat oxidation. But even this can be confounded in people on a ketogenic diet. With patients, Peter will do a Zone 2 test based on their fat oxidation during an escalated VO2 max test. For example, their maximum fat oxidation may be 0.3 g/min, and this occurs at a wattage of 1.5 watts/kg",

  "content": "He would start with a metabolic test; this information can provide watts, or speed, or heart rate (many people don’t have a power meter). Peter brings up another metric he uses with patients, RPE. From his experience, he is in Zone 2 when his lactate levels are between 1.7-1.9 mmol. He can carry on a conversation but it’s not as comfortable. Iñigo agrees, exercising at a level where you can carry on a conversation and it feels a bit strained is a good surrogate for knowing you’re in Zone 2. You will be just at that threshold of not being able to carry on a conversation. The person you’re talking to will know you are exercising",
