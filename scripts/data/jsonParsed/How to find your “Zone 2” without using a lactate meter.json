  "content": "Metrics for finding Zone 2 threshold include lactate, heart rate, and more. In a patient or a world class athlete, indirect calorimetry and lactate testing can be used to determine Zone 2 training. The lactate measured in the blood is heavily influenced by production and clearance. The gold standard would be to measure fat oxidation, but this can be confounded in people on a ketogenic diet.",

  "content": "Training can start with a metabolic test; this information can provide watts, or speed, or heart rate. Another metric used is RPE, or rating of perceived exertion. From experience, being in Zone 2 is when lactate levels are between 1.7-1.9 mmol. Exercising at a level where you can carry on a conversation and it feels a bit strained is a good surrogate for knowing you’re in Zone 2.",
