TIP from Peter’s dentist: Anytime you eat something, chew a piece of xylitol gum for 10 minutes and then spit it out as a way to sort of get rid of it, even using a xylitol based toothpaste and things like that.

It’s chemical structure is the mirror image of fructose (an enantiomer) — a small difference that makes a HUGE impact. When you ingest it, it’s fully absorbed by the intestines which means: i) you do not get any GI distress ii) It’s effectively completely excreted by the kidneys. An animal study in rats reported that allulose only contributes to 0.3% of the energy deposit in animals. More data from animal studies suggest that compared to fructose and/or glucose, allulose may lower blood glucose, reduce abdominal fat, decrease insulin resistance, decrease fat accumulation in the liver; and prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. *But it also has another important effect: A meta analysis of human studies shows that allulose may drag glucose with it, so when you consume it with food it LOWERS postprandial glucose by an average of about 10%. Taste and mouthfeel: It probably has the best taste and mouthfeel of any of these things. It’s almost indistinguishable to sugar when you match it by quantity—so you have to plus it up by about 30-50%. Commercial use: Allulose has struggled to penetrate the market due to early classification as an “added sugar” on food labels. For example, Quest was using allulose in some of it’s products and were required to put “added sugar” on the food label. Partly due to Quest’s efforts, the FDA changed that ruling no longer requiring “added sugar” to be put on the label. In Oct 2019, FDA announced exemption of allulose from total and added sugars on nutritional label but adding 0.4kcal/g as carbohydrate.",

Epidemiology likes to bastardize things like diet Coke, but the reality is that diet Coke consumption is really just a proxy for people who are trying to lose weight. So when it says more people who drink diet Coke have diabetes than people who drink Coke, they’re missing something very obvious.

  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Why might people who go off of non-nutritive sweeteners sometimes report feeling better or losing weight? Peter’s experience with patients has shown numerous cases where a person stops drinking six diet Cokes a day and will get better/feel better. Possible explanations for this: 1 – All that aspartame in that situation was revving up their appetite and they were eating more elsewhere. So, by swapping diet Coke for bubbly water, or water, or coffee, or tea or something else, it reduced total caloric intake. 2 – Some mechanism that pertains to the gut biome. A couple of papers out there that have actually postulated that things like aspartame or other non-nutritive sweeteners can disrupt the gut biome: Saccharin, sucralose, stevia have been studied to alter gut microbiota (more research needed) (Ruiz-Ojeda et al., 2020, Liauchonak et al., 2019). obviously that would be a very plausible explanation for why the response to reducing intake of non-nutritive sweetener is so heterogeneous (in a good way). 3 – A psychological component. People feel like “hey, now that I’m really cleaning things up and I’m not drinking this can of diet Coke, I’m going to make behavioral changes”. You can think of this as the healthy user effect. The upshot: If anybody’s listening to this and they’re kind of plateaued somewhere in their health and they’re still drinking six diet Cokes a day, “I cannot strongly enough advocate that they stop it.” At least try to stop for a designated period of time (e.g., 90 days) to see how you feel. “Because in the end, it doesn’t really matter what a study says. It matters what happens to you.”",
