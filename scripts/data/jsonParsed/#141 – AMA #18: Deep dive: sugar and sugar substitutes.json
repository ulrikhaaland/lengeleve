  "content": "The conversation begins by defining the various forms of sugar, delineating between added sugar and naturally occurring sugar, and describing the important variables that determine the potential for metabolic damage from consumption. Glucose, Galactose, Fructose, Sucrose, and Allulose are all forms of sugar. Glucose and fructose are monomers — they form the simplest building blocks of carbohydrates. They even have the same chemical formula — same number of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygen. The difference is glucose is arranged in a six carbon ring, whereas fructose is arranged in a five carbon ring. This seemingly small difference makes all the difference in the world when it comes to their metabolic effects.",

  "content": "Important variables related to sugar consumption include density, volume, and velocity. Density refers to the concentration of sugar in a given volume, for example, a dried mango versus a whole mango. Volume refers to the actual quantity you consume. Velocity refers to the speed at which you consume sugar. All these factors play a role in the potential for metabolic damage from sugar consumption.",

  "content": "Food labels list both sugar and added sugar. However, it's important to understand that 'naturally occurring' sugar in foods like dried mangoes can be just as harmful as 'added sugar' in products like soda. The misconception is that the dried mango is somehow healthy and the coke is terrible. There’s really no difference in the carbohydrate molecules of sugar found in fruits or HFCS but the soluble fiber in the (non-dried) fruit stabilizes blood sugar.",

  "content": "How quickly do the molecules of sugar make their way out of the stomach and into ultimately the upper part of the duodenum, where they’re functionally going to come in contact with your liver? — that is the question of velocity. With fructose, the “heavy lifting” from a metabolism standpoint is going to be done in the liver. You have a whole mango, and you simply dry it out (remove all the water), it’s just becomes a mass balance equation — it’s now much more dense. If all you’ve given up is water and going from a regular mango to a dried mango, what you’re probably changing is the speed with which it might hit the liver. Additionally, going from whole mango to dried mango allows you to consume much more (volume).",

Alcohol sugars have more calories than others, and they have some advantages to them. Allulose is a molecule that stands in its own place, which is itself a sugar. It meets all the sort of structural classifications of a sugar, but it doesn’t behave like sugar.",

  "content": "Alcohol sugars are all monosaccharides — ‘naturally occurring’ things. Sorbitol and xylitol are caloric. Xylitol is basically matched in sweetness to sucrose. Whereas sorbitol is actually about half to two-thirds as sweet as sucrose. In fact, sorbitol is not even a “low-calorie” food, because if you actually want to get the same sweetness, you’re actually going to bring the caloric value right up to that of sucrose. Erythritol, on the other hand, is actually quite a low-calorie sweetener because it’s about 0.2 kilocalories per gram and it’s almost as sweet as sucrose (60% to 80%).",

It’s chemical structure is the mirror image of fructose (an enantiomer) — a small difference that makes a HUGE impact. When you ingest it, it’s fully absorbed by the intestines which means: i) you do not get any GI distress ii) It’s effectively completely excreted by the kidneys. An animal study in rats reported that allulose only contributes to 0.3% of the energy deposit in animals.",
