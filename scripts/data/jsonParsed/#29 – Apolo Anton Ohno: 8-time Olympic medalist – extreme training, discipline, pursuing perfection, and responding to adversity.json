By 2006, he weighed 155 lbs but could still leg press the same weight. He was significantly leaner. In 2010, he weighed 143 lbs and could leg press nearly 2,000 lbs. He had less ballistic power and stopped doing Olympic lifts. He did a lot of weighted plyometrics and spent much of the time purposefully atrophying his upper body.",
