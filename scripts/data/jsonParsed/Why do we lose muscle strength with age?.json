  "date": "June 11, 2022",
  "context": "Strength & Muscle Mass",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The loss of muscle quality is inevitable, progressing intrinsically at the cellular level at multiple steps along the muscle contraction pathway. Age is also associated with myosin structural changes that reduce its ability to remain in a strong-binding, force-generating state, so muscle contraction is weaker. Additionally, we accumulate oxidative stress-related DNA damage as we age, resulting in a decline in muscle mitochondrial function and lower mitochondrial density, ultimately leading to insufficient production of the ATP needed for muscle contraction.",

  "date": "June 11, 2022",
  "context": "Strength & Muscle Mass",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Another major factor contributing to muscle strength decline is the loss of neuromuscular innervation. Throughout one’s life, nerves constantly undergo cycles of innervating and denervating muscle fibers depending upon muscle usage. The more a muscle is used, the more neuromotor connections it develops, which leads to improved contractile strength. The opposite is also true: muscles that are seldom used become less innervated.",

  "context": "Strength & Muscle Mass",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In older populations, denervation appears to outpace reinnervation, independent of activity level. Studies suggest this may be due to unstable neuromuscular junctions, motor neuron death that occurs with aging, and the impaired ability of neurons to reinnervate fibers. The reduced density of neural connections to muscle fibers equates to reduced communication between the brain and muscle, resulting in lower force, lower speed, and overall compromised performance.",

  "context": "Strength & Muscle Mass",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Increased activation of muscle fibers through physical activity initiates a cascade of events that attenuate muscle strength loss. Active muscle releases a number of biochemical signals which promote growth of motor neuron fibers, induce them to form more connections to the muscle, and enhance excitatory signal transmission at the neuromuscular junction. These combined effects improve neuromuscular communication and lead to better control and increased strength of muscle contractions, counteracting the effects of aging muscles.",
