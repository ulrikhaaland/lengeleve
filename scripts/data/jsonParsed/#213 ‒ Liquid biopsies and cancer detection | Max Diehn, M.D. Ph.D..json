When looking at cell-free DNA, what are the different methods that can be used to predict if a cancer is present? We talk about these cell-free DNA, RNA signatures. We talk about methylation patterns. We talk about the importance of knowing mutation information. We talk about the difference in some of the screenings being approved by the FDA versus those that are being permitted to use for patients without FDA approval formally. We talk about the path to using blood alone as a screening for early detection and the use case for liquid biopsies.",

Often it’s zero for a stage I-II cancer patient, meaning the sensitivity isn’t very good. In stage IV patients they saw quite a lot, some patients had massive amounts. Occasionally he would see early-stage patients with a lot of CTCs. Caroline Dive from University of Manchester did a lot of these studies. Her group took blood from the draining veins at the time of the surgery (the lobectomy for lung cancer) and did circulating tumor cell assays. They found evidence that they could find more signals, meaning that sensitivity was better in that context. If you had 2 stage II patients, one is typical and has no CTCs while the second patient has a reasonably high burden of CTCs, studies show when you see high levels of CTCs, this is a bad thing; patients are at higher risk of recurrence. One complication in the CTC field is that even non-cancer patients can have circulating cells that look like CTCs using the markers available. A marker for CTCs should be expressed in cancer cells but not white blood cells. One marker is cytokeratin, a structural protein specific to epithelial cells. But, Max’s group and others have found healthy patients can also have cells that have cytokeratin expression but no white blood cell marker expression in circulating cells. Other people have gone further to do single cell sequencing of those to show that their genomes are actually normal and not mutated like cancer cells are. It appears that there can be epithelial cells circulating that are not cancer cells; this makes it complicated to look for the presence of tumor cells. This indicates that looking for CTCs is not a good cancer screening tool. Maybe this approach holds some promise for determining the course of adjuvant therapy in a patient. If they see a high number of CTCs then they may want to give the patient additional chemotherapy because of the increased risk of recurrence. This motivated Max to start work on liquid biopsies.

  "content": "Historically most of the reviews and textbooks argue that cfDNA comes from apoptosis. Cells that undergo apoptosis have their DNA chopped up as part of the process. Apoptosis is a type of cell death. It’s a controlled, programmed cell death that gets rid of cells in a tidy way. This is a type of cell suicide that can get activated. It’s critical for our development because sometimes cells have to die to make room for other cells. Apoptosis is part of our normal developmental homeostasis. It also is critical for getting rid of sick cells. DNA inside a cell is chopped up during apoptosis. DNA could also get released from cells through a non-apoptosis process, and it would likely become chopped up too. Necrosis is another way a cell can die and release some of its contents into the blood.",

CLiP stands for cancer likelihood in plasma. Published in Nature in 2020, Integrating genomic features for noninvasive early lung cancer detection. This method is purely based on mutations. How it works‒ sequence the plasma and the white blood cells of the patients you’re trying to screen. They’ve learned (particularly in older individuals) that there are mutations present in the leukocytes often that have been acquired through age through a process called clonal hematopoiesis. So those mutations that are in the white blood cells end up showing up in the plasma most of the time because the white blood cells die in the circulation and release their DNA and that’s part of the cfDNA. These mutations are not coming from the cancer; so you want to get rid of these from the testing process. Then use a machine learning algorithm that looks at the mutations that are left in the plasma and looks at things like the length of the cell-free DNA molecule (in base pairs, bp). Max and others have shown, that the cancer derived cfDNA molecules are a little bit shorter than that 170 bp. They look at the mutation present, what gene is it in, how long is the cfDNA fragment and the machine learning model tells them if they have seen this mutation before in lung cancer and the model ultimately determines a probability that that blood sample was from a patient with lung cancer or not. Max envisions this mutation based screening approach where you’re not actually using a catalog of mutations because that won’t work because every cancer is unique and you can have a mutation in any gene in any position. The machine learning is used to predict what would be a cancer mutation or not. In the follow-up work, he is trying to add more features.
