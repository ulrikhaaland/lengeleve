He also works to understand cancer cells by identifying molecular pathways and genes associated with disease. He’s interested in uncovering biomarkers that can predict response to therapy or predict patient survival and return of disease as early as possible. Clinically, Max is a radiation oncologist and he specializes in lung cancer. He manages a broad clinical research portfolio, and he focuses on improving these personalized therapies for patients with lung cancer.",

In this episode, we get a lot more granular around the nuances of the different ways in which not just we can look at circulating tumor cells versus cell-free DNA. When looking at cell-free DNA, what are the different methods that can be used to predict if a cancer is present? How can we look at the actual genes from the actual cancer that we know we’re searching for versus in a screening situation when we don’t know the gene that we have to look for other clues.",

One project focused on T cells, a critical part of the adaptive immune system. He was interested to see what genes are turned on and off in T cells when they are activated. DNA microarrays allowed him to see hundreds and thousands of genes changing as he manipulated T cells. He was able to build a catalog of all the genes that turned on or turned off when T cells were activated using different signals. This catalog has been very helpful for understanding the mechanism of T cell activation. This has gotten more interesting with the advent of immunotherapy.",

He remembers trying to write some papers in the call room, to finish up work from his PhD. Radiation oncology residency programs have a research track for individuals who are interested in laboratory based research called the home and pathway. In other fields this is called short tracking or fast tracking. The idea is they can trade in some of the clinical training time for research time. This gave him a postdoc time of about 2 years during his 4 years of radiation oncology residency. During that postdoc time, he had clinic activities about half a day to a day a week and the other days were in the lab.",

  "content": "All research projects begin with a clinical need. Treating early stage lung cancer patients left Max frustrated. Stage 1 or stage 2 lung cancer, which means the cancer hasn’t spread (as far as they could tell). He could cure the majority of these patients with targeted, high dose radiation. But the cancer came back for 20-25% of these patients. After he finished treatment, in the 1st follow-up visit 3 months after radiation, he couldn’t tell who was cured and who would have the cancer come back. State-of-the-art at the time was to have patients come back for scans every 3, 6, 12 months. It is hard to see things much smaller than one centimeter in diameter, maybe eight millimeters. This will depend somewhat on the location in the body. As a general rule of thumb, this is about a billion cells‒ a vast number of cancer cells.",

Once the cancer has spread to many places in the body, it cannot be removed or you can’t radiate it all. The problem is what’s called micrometastatic disease or microscopic disease that has spread elsewhere in the body, you could have dozens or even hundreds of these micrometastatic deposits in different organs; and these are all under 0.5 cm. The detection of micrometastatic disease is beyond the limits of our imaging methods; we can’t see them all.",

  "content": "The history of blood-based tests for cancer. There are a couple areas where blood tests for specific proteins are being used for cancer screening; they’re not great. PSA levels for prostate cancer. CEA levels for colon cancer. CA 19-9 levels for pancreatic cancer. These examples above are all protein biomarkers. Proteins made by cancer cells that are shed into the blood where they can be measured in a non-invasive fashion. A large issue with these protein biomarkers is that they are actually not that specific for cancer, meaning that these are also proteins that normal cells can make. Cancers often make more of these proteins. The problem is knowing how to interpret low levels of these proteins.",

Outcomes in breast or prostate cancer are actually much better; we can cure a large fraction of these patients. The vast majority of patients with lung cancer, historically, cannot be cured. This is why lung cancer is the #1 cause of cancer-related death. The incidence of lung cancer is going down in men and now also in women due to a decrease in smoking. Secondly treatment have gotten better. Screening is slowly getting better. While smoking is by far the largest risk factor for lung cancer, it’s not the only risk factor. Lung cancer can develop as a result of: pollution, radon gas or other things in the environment, genetic associations.",

There have been a lot of efforts to develop a screening test for lung cancer, given that it is the number one cause of cancer deaths. There have been a lot of failures. Initial studies focused on chest x-rays; there was little benefit due to low resolution. The National Lung Screening Trial took patients and randomized them to get either a low-dose CT scan or a chest x-ray. There was a relative reduction of risk of about 20% in the patients who got the low-dose CT scan. This was viewed as a win for using low-dose CT as a screening test. The absolute risk reduction was small, in the single digit %.",
