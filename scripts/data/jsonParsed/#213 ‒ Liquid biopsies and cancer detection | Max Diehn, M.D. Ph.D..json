  "content": "Max discusses the history of blood-based cancer screening and the importance of understanding the predictive value of tests—sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value – and how these metrics play into cancer screening. Max then goes in depth on the topic of liquid biopsies, including the history, current landscape, and possible future of liquid biopsies as a cancer detection tool. He discusses how these non-invasive blood tests can detect DNA/RNA from tumor cells released into the blood as well as the different methods one can use to predict if a cancer is present. He gets granular on the topic of cell-free DNA/RNA signature, methylation patterns, and the importance of knowing mutation information, and he ends with a discussion on the exciting future of liquid biopsies and how we can possibly get to the panacea of cancer screening.",

He was interested to see what genes are turned on and off in T cells when they are activated. He was able to build a catalog of all the genes that turned on or turned off when T cells were activated using different signals. This catalog has been very helpful for understanding the mechanism of T cell activation. The other project Max worked on during his PhD was to develop a method to isolate RNA that’s stuck to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) inside cells.",

For example, in his experiments with T cell stimulation, the cells are alive. This maintains the RNA. Only once the cells die does degradation start to happen. The experiment is designed carefully to immediately add solutions to protect the RNA after the cells are killed at the end of the experiment. So there’s not time for chemical degradation of the RNA. He did a lot of work on methods to stabilize RNA.",

This convinced him to be on the doctor’s side to help people, not just on the patient side with his father. He wanted to, “Help patients at the time of their life where it might be the worst time of their life as well as to try to move the field forward to improve treatments that while they worked somewhat obviously were not good enough.” He came to medical school with an inkling that oncology was where he wanted to be.",
