  "content": "The textbook went through, in great detail, the pathological staging of atherosclerosis; it was also littered with autopsy sections of coronary arteries from people who had died for other reasons. Looking at their coronary arteries, one realizes they already have atherosclerosis; they have oxidized apoB-bearing particles engulfed by macrophages and thickened intima. Notably, many of these people who died from other causes, but their coronary arteries were studied in autopsy, these people were quite young. A 26-year-old male victim of a gunshot wound; or a 27-year-old female who died in a motor vehicle accident, etc.",

It’s a very sobering fact. He doesn’t think this is true today, but it was 25 years ago. Maybe now one third of first events are fatal; sobering nonetheless.",
