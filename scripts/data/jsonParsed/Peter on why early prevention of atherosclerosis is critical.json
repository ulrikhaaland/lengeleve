These individuals, some as young as 26 or 27, have oxidized apoB-bearing particles engulfed by macrophages and thickened intima in their coronary arteries. While they may not have calcification or the types of plaque that would rupture imminently, they nevertheless had atherosclerosis.",

Further research has demonstrated apoB to be superior to LDL-cholesterol as a marker of the risk of vascular disease. Current research interests include understanding the regulation of plasma LDL, creating simplified but advanced diagnostic algorithms to recognize and treat those with and those at high risk of vascular disease, and developing new models to determine the absolute value of different strategies to identify and treat those at risk of vascular disease.",
