  "content": "A study conducted on 122,000 patients found that there is a monotonic relationship between fitness and mortality. The biggest gap is between the people in the bottom 25% who are categorized as low fitness and everyone above them. Going from low to below average is a 50% reduction in mortality over a decade. Going from low to above average is about a 60% or 70% reduction in mortality. The lowest improvement is going from high to elite. If you compare someone of low fitness to elite, it is a five-fold difference in mortality over a decade. Improving your fitness can have a significant impact on mortality rates.",

  "content": "When comparing the differences in fitness levels, it gives you a greater appreciation for how much improvement in mortality comes from improving your fitness. The biggest driver of mortality is end-stage renal disease in this cohort, which is the same as going from low cardiorespiratory fitness to above average cardiorespiratory fitness. Going from the bottom 25th percentile to being in the 50th to 75th percentile is a totally achievable feat.",
