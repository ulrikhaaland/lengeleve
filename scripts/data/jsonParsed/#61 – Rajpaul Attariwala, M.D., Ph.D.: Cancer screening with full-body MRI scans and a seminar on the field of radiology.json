Therefore, on the film on the other side it stays white. Unfortunately, there were lots of casualties due to radiation. Our understanding of radiation has actually been moved by really traumatic events such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki where we’ve actually been able to watch people over time. DNA of the cells get damaged and there’s a risk of inducing cancers with that. Different types of x-rays and scans have differing amounts of radiation.

It found that the younger you are, the greater the risk of cancer induction from CT scanners. Also, females are actually more sensitive to radiation than men. This is because the egg is actually produced during embryonic stage. As a result, that DNA is effectively frozen in time. Therefore, the younger you are, the fresher the DNA. Around age 12 is when this DNA comes out of the “frozen” state during the beginning of menstruation and that’s when these eggs start to be released.

What makes our blood red is actually the iron that’s contained within it. So what you can do is take all the blood that’s flowing to a particular organ like the head. And you can actually “excite” anything going up north to the brain (and so therefore that’s arteries). So you get to see all the exquisite arteries in your brain just by exciting that blood. Directionally, it’s so clear, you know which way your magnet is oriented, you know which way blood flow away from the heart, and you’ve got this beautiful iron floating around in water.",

We do the head first and that’s not nearly as much as doing mid and lower body. The thighs, for example, are probably where a ton of that heat gets generated right. When you look at basically the overall blood flow, which is what cools your body, the brain takes 20% of your cardiac output (it’s this big heat sink…it’s a just cools everything away) Whereas when you get down and lower to the legs, which you’re all muscle, it’s going to heat that up, and so that’s why we figured out how to orient these in what organization to make or what plan of sequences to make it not as uncomfortable.",
