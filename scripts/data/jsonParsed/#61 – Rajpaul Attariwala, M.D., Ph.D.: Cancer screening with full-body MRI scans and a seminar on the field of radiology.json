  "content": "It seems that where the machine might first be able to make a dent in what you’re doing is not the patient who gets their first scan, but the one who gets the repeat scan. Specifically, the paired t-test seems to be an easier problem to solve but an important problem to solve. When you actually go and you take a paired of t-test, and you actually do a subtraction of where you’re looking for the difference or that delta, it can actually stand out and become very, very simple and very obvious. Once that’s subtraction is done, I think that’s where machine learning will actually really help make us more efficient and at the end of the day, we just don’t want to miss anything.",
