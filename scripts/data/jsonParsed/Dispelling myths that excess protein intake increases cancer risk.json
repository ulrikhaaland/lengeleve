  "content": "Layne Norton dispels the myth that excess protein intake increases cancer risk through elevations in mTOR and IGF-1. He explains that mTOR elevations that lead to cancer originate mostly via insulin resistance. There’s a big difference between a dose of protein that causes mTOR to rise and go back down in a natural rhythm and a chronic stimulus. This is also tissue-specific; we’re talking about in skeletal muscle, not liver, not brain necessarily, those sorts of things. The same is true for IGF-1.",

If you look at people with elevated inflammation, their inflammatory markers are not super high but are elevated all the time. It’s the chronic pulse that’s the problem.",

  "content": "Layne Norton explains that mTOR plays a role in cancer, but it can’t be the cart before the horse sort of thing. People will say Rapamycin is an mTOR inhibitor and that’s a cancer treatment drug. But is it a good idea to use chemotherapy to prevent cancer? Peter Attia adds that Rapamycin has never been a particularly successful cancer therapeutic used constituently. It does show benefits for longevity in basically all animal models. So the extrapolation would be pulsatile rapamycin is probably beneficial.",

IGF levels have a J curve with mortality and therefore very, very high levels of IGF must be problematic.",

Meta-analysis looking at cancer and protein content of the diet look at above 70 g protein per day (1.2 g / kg body weight). Layne notes, “What they found was that at the highest levels of meat intake, but also with the highest levels of fruit and vegetable intake, there was no difference in cancer incidents between the lowest level of meat intake and even with the highest level of fruit and vegetable intake”. So high protein is not an issue in a healthy diet.",
