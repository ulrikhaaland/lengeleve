  "content": "Dispelling myths that excess protein intake increases cancer risk through elevations in mTOR and IGF. mTOR elevations that lead to cancer and whatnot, those originate mostly via insulin resistance. Elevations in insulin result in insulin signaling through AKT, which can then transmit to mTOR. There’s a big difference between a dose of protein that causes mTOR to rise and go back down in a natural rhythm and a chronic stimulus. This is also tissue-specific; we’re talking about in skeletal muscle, not liver, not brain necessarily, those sorts of things. The same is true for IGF-1. The amplitude of response from mTOR due to resistance training dwarfs what protein does. If we look at the meta-analyses on cancer incidence amongst resistance trainers, we see lower levels of cancer in people who resistance train.",

  "content": "Viewed in a certain light, exercise seems unhealthy but we know it is not. Exercise is a short-term stressor, it’s a controlled dose of a stressor that your body can handle. There’s a difference between an acute response and a chronic response. If you look at people with elevated inflammation, their inflammatory markers are not super high but are elevated all the time. It’s the chronic pulse that’s the problem.",

  "content": "We have this idea that like, there’s this perfect diet out there. That’s going to be the one diet that’s going to reduce cancer and cardiovascular disease and mortality and all that. And the fact is that there’s probably trade offs for everything. There are people that will say that protein increases cancer. There’s a ton of cofounders to that. Meta-analysis looking at cancer and protein content of the diet look at above 70 g protein per day (1.2 g / kg body weight). Most Americans eat high protein according to the RDA definition but where is this from? Burgers, hot dogs, and processed meat. What is the incidence of cancer in people who just have a high protein, but overall healthy diet? Here’s the thing, most people who eat high levels of meat eat low levels of fruits and vegetables. What they found was that at the highest levels of meat intake, but also with the highest levels of fruit and vegetable intake, there was no difference in cancer incidents between the lowest level of meat intake and even with the highest level of fruit and vegetable intake. So high protein is not an issue in a healthy diet. It suggests that the quality of the overall diet is what is important.",

The same is true for plant-based, intermittent fasting, etc. A lot of it boils down to: What are the food choices you’re making on balance? Are you getting enough fruits and vegetables and minerals and micronutrients? Every time we try to say, fruits and vegetables have these benefits on health that we see pretty consistently, so let’s try and take out these isolated micronutrients and give them in the supplements. We’re always disappointed with the results. We have to eat the whole food to get those benefits.",
