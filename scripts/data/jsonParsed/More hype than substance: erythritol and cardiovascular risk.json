  "content": "A study published reported that the common sweetener erythritol increases risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular (CV) death. Many processed food products and artificial sweeteners have begun to include erythritol among their ingredients over the past few years. Investigators first identified erythritol as a molecule of interest by conducting metabolomics analyses on fasting plasma samples from participants to determine which circulating compounds were associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: death, heart attack, or stroke) over a maximum 3-year follow-up period. Erythritol emerged as one of the top hits for MACE association.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The possibility that erythritol might contribute to MACE risk by enhancing blood clotting, thus increasing risk of vascular blockage was evaluated. They applied varying concentrations of erythritol or control solution to human platelet-rich plasma and observed a dose-dependent relationship between erythritol treatment and platelet aggregation, one of the early steps in blood clot formation. Additionally, injecting mice with erythritol sped the rate of clot formation relative to control solutions.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The authors demonstrate that everyone is in danger of extraordinarily high circulating erythritol levels if the sweetener is included in one’s diet. The investigators had participants consume a single erythritol-sweetened drink and found that circulating levels spiked by as much as 1000x baseline values within 30 minutes – well over the ranges at which clotting effects had been present – and did not return to more normal levels until more than a day later.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "As with most observational studies, the human investigations do not demonstrate causality. The authors present these data as evidence that erythritol raises MACE risk, but the fact that our bodies produce erythritol as a result of metabolic processes introduces a very high likelihood of a “third variable problem” – a situation in which two unrelated variables appear to be correlated because they are both influenced by a third, unknown variable.",
