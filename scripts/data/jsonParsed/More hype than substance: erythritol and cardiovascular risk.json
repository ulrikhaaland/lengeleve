  "content": "A study published this past Monday reported that the common sweetener erythritol increases risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular (CV) death. Investigators Witkowski et al. first identified erythritol as a molecule of interest by conducting metabolomics analyses on fasting plasma samples from 1,157 participants (the “discovery cohort”) to determine which circulating compounds were associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: death, heart attack, or stroke) over a maximum 3-year follow-up period. Erythritol emerged as one of the top hits for MACE association, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.22 (95% CI: 1.91–5.41, P<0.0001).",

  "content": "Witkowski et al. then evaluated the possibility that erythritol might contribute to MACE risk by enhancing blood clotting, thus increasing risk of vascular blockage. They applied varying concentrations of erythritol or control solution to human platelet-rich plasma and observed a dose-dependent relationship between erythritol treatment and platelet aggregation, one of the early steps in blood clot formation. Additionally, injecting mice with erythritol sped the rate of clot formation relative to control solutions, though it is worth noting that serum erythritol concentrations in this experiment were over double the highest concentrations seen in the human discovery, US, or Europe cohorts.",

  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The problem with interpreting these results as a condemnation of erythritol consumption is that diet isn’t the only source of circulating erythritol. This compound is also produced by our own bodies through a process known as the pentose phosphate pathway, one of the pathways by which we metabolize glucose. So how can we tell if dietary erythritol intake in particular is contributing to MACE risk?",

For those who would still rather steer clear until we have more data on this relatively new sweetener, there are plenty of alternatives available. Regardless of this study, I and most of my patients generally find erythritol to be the least appealing of sugar substitutes in large part because of the non-trivial gastrointestinal side effects many experience after consuming it.",
