Type 2 diabetes is defined as having a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) concentration greater than 6.5% which corresponds to an average glucose of approximately 130 milligrams per deciliter. However, this can be misleading in both directions due to factors such as the lifespan of red blood cells and blood loss.",

  "content": "A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) provides superior insights. It measures glucose continuously, providing data every five minutes in a 24 hour fashion. It can provide reports on average glucose over various periods along with the standard deviation and more. It measures in the interstitial fluid, imputing what the glucose level is in the blood without actually having to sample the blood. CGM actually gives you average blood glucose and you can reverse engineer and impute at A1c, which is much more interesting because you’re directly measuring the variable of interest.",

The data from the CGM would be analyzed by the doctor, providing a detailed look at the patient's glucose levels over a period of time. This could replace the need for an A1c or fasting glucose test. Similarly, some doctors are already using home blood pressure monitors for their patients. However, wearable technology for blood pressure monitoring is still not ready for widespread use.",
