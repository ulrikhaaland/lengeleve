Started treating mice at 4 months of age and treated them until death. Extended the median survival of the males and females 22% and 5% respectively. It extended peak lifespan by 11% and 9% respectively. One of the interesting findings in the study is that when they looked at the body weight and the body weight reductions in acarbose, they’re actually greater in the female mice. The median lifespan extension was 5% compared to 22% in males, yet you’ve got greater weight loss in the females than the males and the males extend their lifespan nearly three and half fold more than the females. In this case surprisingly it was the fasting glucose levels were higher in the acarbose mice versus the control mice. Their HbA1c levels were unaltered. They had higher fasting glucose, no difference in HbA1c, but basically the researcher said that it was consistent with the concept that it might just be the glucose peaks rather than average glucose. So the glucose peaks alone could be the factor here. Peter thinks they didn’t see a difference in A1c and they saw a higher fasting glucose because fasting glucose is measured after a long period of not eating and he animals that were taking acarbose would have a slower release of glucose in their GI tract.",

When looking at the 90th percentile survival, both male and female mice saw an extension of 12% and 6%, respectively. The effect did not seem to depend on weight or average blood glucose.",

  "content": "In 2019, mice were treated with acarbose at different doses starting at 8 months of age. The males did better with 11%, 17%, and 16% extension in lifespan. For females, the results were less than 1%, 5%, and 4%. The females continue to have a greater reduction in body weight, suggesting something else is going on here. The take-home point is that the peaks in glucose matter independent of average glucose, independent of weight or caloric intake, and the earlier you start in life, the better.",

  "content": "The ITP conducted a study on canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor that inhibits glucose reuptake in the kidneys. The study showed that it extended median and 90th percentile survival of male mice by 14% and 9%, respectively, but did not extend lifespan in female mice. It showed a lower fasting glucose and improved glucose tolerance in both sexes but only the longevity benefit in the male mice. Body weight was reduced more in the females than the males, suggesting it is not a CR mimetic by mechanism where the female mice peed out more glucose and therefore had fewer calories.",
