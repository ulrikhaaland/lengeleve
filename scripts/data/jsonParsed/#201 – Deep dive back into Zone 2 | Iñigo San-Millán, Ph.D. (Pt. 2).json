Normally glucose goes through glycolysis and ends up in the cytosol, outside the mitochondria, where it is oxidized to pyruvate. That pyruvate enters the mitochondria via a pyruvate carrier. In the mitochondria it’s oxidized to acetyl-CoA which enters the Krebs cycle (aka the citric acid cycle). Complete oxidation of glucose occurs via oxidative phosphorylation using the the electron transport chain. Fatty acids use a similar mechanism. Fatty acids get converted to acetyl-CoA through different mechanisms. Fatty acids are processed by CPT-1 then CPT-2; this converts them to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria for oxidation. But every time you use glucose, you produce pyruvate. And every single time, that pyruvate is going to be reduced to lactate. When glycolysis is utilized rapidly, this will deplete NAD+ and the only way to replenish it is to reduce pyruvate to lactate. This is necessary for glycolysis to continue. But this lactate enters the mitochondria through a specific transporter (MCT1), then a specific enzyme (LDH, lactate dehydrogenase) oxidizes lactate back to pyruvate so it can enter the Krebs cycle.

There are 2 fates of glucose byproducts. 1) Traditionally we think of glucose being reduced to pyruvate (via glycolysis), pyruvate entering the mitochondria then being converted to acetyl-CoA. This follows the same fate of the fatty acid (Krebs cycle + electron transport chain = ATP). As energy demands increase, no matter how fit you are, at some point you produce more lactate and don’t have enough cellular oxygen to go down this first route. 2) If there are enough MCT1 transporters in the mitochondria, you can bring lactate into the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation. Lactate is converted back to pyruvate. Pyruvate becomes acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle, and this will continue on to the electron transport chain where the majority of ATP is produced.

  "content": "Metabolomics reveals how cellular metabolism is altered in sedentary individuals. In sedentary individuals there is a decreased capacity of the mitochondria to oxidize fuels (pyruvate, fatty acids, and amino acids). There is also a significant decreases in the complexes that make up the electron transport chain. There is decreased capacity of the transporters that move different metabolites into the mitochondria. The transporter for pyruvate into the mitochondria is also dysregulated in sedentary individuals (as compared to active individuals). Similarly, oxidation of pyruvate in the mitochondria is dysregulated.",
