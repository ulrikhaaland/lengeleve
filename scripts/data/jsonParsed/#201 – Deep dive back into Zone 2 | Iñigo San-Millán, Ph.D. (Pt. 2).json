It was a very difficult climb and a very long climb; Pogačar’s mentality was wired like a champion. He knows the top of the climb is not the end of the stage. It has a very long descent. Having a big gap and knowing you have a big descent, and staying calm is an important strategy. The day before, 2 cyclists George Bennett and Sergio Higuita attacked in a short but very steep climb. There were maybe 12 riders left when they attacked. Then there was a descent and a long highway all the way to the finish line; so there was plenty of time to catch up. Tadej didn’t follow them; he strategized that he had time and would take the chance on beating them tomorrow. These guys were caught 2-3 kilometers to the finish line. So all those 12 guys got together the next day, and Tadej eliminated them one by one. This is how Tadej thinks— no panic, plenty of time today, “Why am I going to go full gas when I know that he’s going to go full gas and he might lose energy for tomorrow because he might pay for this at this time of the tour de France and we have plenty of time to catch him up”.",

When the racing season begins, there may be one stage race of 5-7 days then he will have a 5 day block (or 1 week) to recover before the next stage race. He alternates using different energy systems; each energy system has a time in the year where it is used in order to try to achieve certain goals. The intensity of exercise is important to stress the mitochondria and oxidative capacity. This will recruit mainly type 1 muscle fibers. Zone 2 exercise intensity is the best at stimulating mitochondrial function and fat oxidation and lactate cleanse capacity. Lactate can be used as a fuel. Lactate is a great fuel for cells; it’s probably the preferred fuel for most cells in the body. This is work that George Brooks discovered; Iñigo would not be surprised if he wins the Nobel Prize.",

A patient with metabolic syndrome can exercise for a couple hours with a blood lactate level of 2.5 mmol. A professional athlete is going to be hurting at that lactate level. 4 mmol is the gold standard for lactate threshold. Put a world class athlete and a recreational athlete at 4 mmol lactate and measure intensity and power output and ask who can maintain this output the longest. Intuitively you would think it would be the world class athlete; it’s the opposite. Iñigo observed this 20 years ago. Recreational athletes at the same blood lactate concentration would go about 30% longer because metabolically, it’s not as taxing for them as an elite athlete.

Lactate has 2 routes it can take. 1) Lactate can go from the fast twitch muscle fibers to the slow twitch muscle fibers. This is the lactate shadow that George Brooks discovered. Lactate is oxidized in the mitochondria of those slow twitch muscle fibers. When someone has good lactate clearance capacity, they will be good at oxidizing it for fuel and will not use the 2nd route. 2) Lactate can be exported to the blood. This occurs when there is poor mitochondrial function. When the ability of the mitochondria to take in and oxidize lactate is saturated, the lactate will be exported to the blood. This will be at a lower power output in less fit individuals. This is why looking at blood lactate levels in individuals at different fitness levels may not mean the same thing.

  "content": "As exercise intensity increases, one needs to oxidize more carbohydrates. As exercise intensity increases, one may get to the maximum for fat oxidation and in a moment switch to glycolytic fibers. As exercise intensity increases beyond a certain point, fat oxidation declines sharply and disappears. High intensity exercise requires energy to be produced quickly by glycolysis (utilization of carbohydrates). Lactate is the byproduct of glucose utilization. Figure 5 shows the comparison between blood lactate and carbohydrate oxidation at different power outputs in: elite athletes (A), moderately active individuals (B), and individuals with metabolic syndrome (C). The correlations are quite good because lactate is the byproduct of glucose utilization. In the elite athletes (A) the gap is wider; they use a lot of glucose. The larger the gap between the blood lactate curve and carbohydrate oxidation curve, the more efficient the individual is in clearing lactate (oxidizing lactate). Here the lactate doesn’t show up in the blood, it stays in the muscle. This reflects the lactate shuttle (MCT transporters at work); this allows the mitochondria to use lactate as a fuel.",

In the mitochondria it’s oxidized to acetyl-CoA which enters the Krebs cycle (aka the citric acid cycle). Complete oxidation of glucose occurs via oxidative phosphorylation using the the electron transport chain. Fatty acids get converted to acetyl-CoA through different mechanisms. Fatty acids are processed by CPT-1 then CPT-2; this converts them to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria for oxidation. But every time you use glucose, you produce pyruvate. And every single time, that pyruvate is going to be reduced to lactate; this is the key concept. Glycolysis utilizes NAD+ and transforms it to NADH + hydrogen. When glycolysis is utilized rapidly, this will deplete NAD+ and the only way to replenish it is to reduce pyruvate to lactate. This is necessary for glycolysis to continue. But this lactate enters the mitochondria through a specific transporter (MCT1), then  a specific enzyme (LDH, lactate dehydrogenase) oxidizes lactate back to pyruvate so it can enter the Krebs cycle.

We know that metformin inhibits complex I, which is key for mitochondrial function. It’s part of the electron transport chain. He will see someone showing up with a lactate of 3.5 mmol at rest and the first thing he asks is if they are taking metformin; many times the answer is yes. He thinks elevated lactate levels are an artifact of taking metformin. Peter notes that patients taking metformin, their fat oxidation is suppressed because when they undergo metabolic testing, it show a very, very low level of fat oxidation. So their blood lactate levels don’t really speak to what is happening in the mitochondria.

Iñigo’s colleague at the University of Colorado, Brian Bergman, is working to characterize the content of these fat droplets. One thing they know is these fat droplets are very high in ceramides and diglycerides. Ceramides are key in the athelosclerotic process;they are a hallmark of cardiovascular disease. Historically it has been shown that ceramides are released from the liver. Now he is seeing that ceramides are in intramuscular triglycerides.",

Iñigo is working to establish the connections between type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at the mitochondrial level. We know that about 80% of people with type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease (and vice versa), which is why it is called cardiometabolic disease. “Could the nexus of all that be a mitochondrial impairment?”— Iñigo San-Millán. Peter comments, he’s going to need to do a 3rd podcast in a couple years when all of this data is published. There’s going to be a lot more questions to be answered.",
