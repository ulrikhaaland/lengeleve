  "content": "A recently published study investigated the efficacy of a weight loss drug – semaglutide – as a treatment for obesity in an adolescent population. In adults with obesity, these medications have demonstrated impressive weight loss effects. A 68-week phase III semaglutide trial reported body weight reductions of over 17% from baseline.",

  "content": "A double-blind, randomized trial was conducted with 201 adolescents aged 12 to <18 with overweight or obesity. They were randomized to receive either once-weekly semaglutide or placebo for a period of 68 weeks. At the end of the intervention period, the average change in BMI among participants in the semaglutide group was -16.1% from baseline, compared to a slight increase from baseline in the placebo group (+0.6%).",

Data in adults show that body weight reductions on semaglutide rebound if treatment is ceased. These findings indicate that the medications must be taken indefinitely to sustain weight loss.",

But we still know so little about these medications and their effects, and more thorough research is needed. Each case must be evaluated individually to determine whether benefits outweigh possible risks. Age is an important variable in that evaluation, and minors run the greatest risks with regard to developmental impacts and long-term health.",
