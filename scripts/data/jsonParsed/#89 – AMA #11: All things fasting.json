  "content": "The overnight fast is the standard fast that almost by definition everybody does between dinner and breakfast. Time restricted feeding (TRF) is the idea where you increase that window from just an overnight fast into a slightly longer window. Alternate day fasting (ADF) means that every other day you do something other than eating ad libitum. Intermittent fasting (IF) is undergoing a fast (of at least 24 hours) at some frequency. 5:2 hypocaloric fast is another popular variation of fasting where five days out of the seven-day week you’re eating normally but two days out of the seven-day week (but not successive days), you are typically eating a hypocaloric diet of 400 to 600 calories. Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) is a trademarked protocol coined by a company called L-Nutra which sells a prepackaged five-day fast. Prolonged fasting/multiple-day fasting is a true fast is water only (plus minerals) for a period of time (typically three to seven days at a time).",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "For 2020, Peter plans to switch to a 3-day water-only fast once per month. There will be a more consistent exposure to fasting but at the same time, he may not be going as deep into the physiologic effects of fasting. Peter’s intuition is that 3 days is probably the minimum amount of time needed to hit some of the important physiologic benchmarks such as glycogen depletion which leads to inhibition of mTOR, activation of AMPK, a significant reduction of glucose and insulin that triggers autophagy and the inhibition of senescent cells.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter relies heavily on his CGM to give him insights during his fast. He looking for thinking like, what’s the behavior of my glucose at night? When in a fed state, his nighttime glucose can actually be quite erratic and he tends to run the highest glucose at night. When in a fasted state, that erratic nature of glucose tends to vanish by the end of 48 hours (and certainly by the third day of only consuming water). He basically has a flat line of glucose and it’s a very low number, typically in the 60s. The only thing that can make it budge is exercise.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Subjects were fasted for 40 days on water-only. After a month+, they maintained the blood glucose of about three millimolar which would be in the high 50s. The body is breaking down triglycerides into free fatty acids which are then used to make the ketones. The backbone of that free fatty acid is glycerol which then becomes gluconeogenic substrate. The liver takes that backbone of glycerol (three carbons) and it makes glucose. So even though you’re not eating, you’re still able to make glucose in the liver and the brain is still dependent on glucose even in a fasted state.",

Supplement protocol includes Magnesium, Methylated B vitamin complex, Sodium. He does NOT take rapamycin or metformin during a fast. On the three-day fast Peter recently did, he did NOT supplement any sodium at all and felt great. On the seven-day fasts, he’s historically required two additional grams of sodium which he takes in the form of bouillon.",

It’s pretty easy for the body to undergo some atrophy during a fast, and If we’d like to minimize that it’s [through strength training]. During a fast, the body’s lean mass can undergo some atrophy. The best way to combat that is by strength training (about 30-60 minutes ideally). He attempts to get in at least 60 minutes of strength training per day during a fast.",

T4 is inactive so the body has to convert it into either the active hormone which is T3; or the anti-active hormone which is called reverse T3.",
