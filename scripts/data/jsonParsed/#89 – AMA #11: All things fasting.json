When fasting, Peter’s changes out the magnesium oxide with a slow absorbing version of magnesium and he also continues to take magnesium L-threonate. He does NOT take rapamycin or metformin during a fast. On the three-day fast Peter recently did, he did NOT supplement any sodium at all and felt great (i.e., not lightheaded).

So the body will fight like hell for that extra milliequivalent of potassium and it will do so at the expense of sodium often and/or magnesium. So that’s why supplementing those things becomes an optimal way for your body to preserve potassium, and it’s much safer to supplement magnesium and sodium than to supplement potassium.",

In an environment where food is scarce, the body absolutely wants to slow down your metabolism. The greatest tool it has for doing that is by making more reverse T3 via an up-regulation a type of deiodinase enzyme that makes it. And it will do so at the expense of making the active T3. For Peter personally… He measures thyroid function during towards the end of his fasts and he’s “blown away” at the deterioration of thyroid function. So not only has that slowed his metabolic rate down but, as a result of that, he is much more sensitive to cold. Usually a week after re-feeding, Peter’s thyroid function is completely back to normal. And after years of fasting, he’s seen no long-term signs of concern",
