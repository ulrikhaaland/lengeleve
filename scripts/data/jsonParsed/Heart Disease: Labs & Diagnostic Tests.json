  "content": "In Peter’s practice, apoB is the most important metric they look at to predict risk (though not the only marker). Labs to identify biomarkers of ASCVD include the full lipid panel, Lp(a) (measured at least once), apoB, and APOE (genotype). These measures tell about the risk but not how much atherosclerosis is currently present. There are not great biomarkers for assessing how much atherosclerosis is present. Additional measurements factor into how risk is managed, such as homocysteine, uric acid, thyroid function, iron, and ferritin.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Diagnostic tests to determine the level of arterial damage present include CAC, CTA, CIMT, and more. The 2 most important things we can look at are: 1 – Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and 2 – A CT angiogram (CTA). The CT angiogram (CTA) is a much better test, but it comes at a higher cost and it comes with more radiation. Really, the CAC and the CTA are a very important thing that we use also in risk prediction, especially if the patient is themselves on the fence about preventative measures.",
