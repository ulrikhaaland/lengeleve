Their superpower is how long they can go before they get the first chink in their armor. But once that disease sets in, they’ve basically been exposed to kryptonite and they are now just mere mortals like the rest of us. In other words, they simply have a “phase shift” of about 20 years before they get chronic disease compared to the average person.

The closest monotherapy outcome trial was SHARP – which was a trial of people with significant renal impairment—For year one, it was simvastatin + ezetimibe vs ezetimibe monotherapy vs placebo and starting at year 2 and thereafter it was simvastatin + ezetimibe vs placebo. In the SEAS trial (to see effect on aortic stenosis outcomes) it was simvastatin + ezetimibe vs placebo. In post-hoc analysis, the statin + ezetimibe vs placebo did reduce events of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) but not atherosclerotic-related events.",
