  "content": "Calcium scans vs. CT angiogram (CTA) [21:15]. Ethan tells patients, “What you get from a CTA is clarity and more information, which in most cases is really, really good”. This comes at a small cost in terms of increased radiation, some potential risk of the contrast (relatively small), and the biggest cost it it’s hard to get it paid for. Calcium scans are also paid for out of pocket (90%), but they are inexpensive (a $100-200). If CTA’s were covered universally, Ethan would go to this test over the calcium scan. It provides so much more information. In a lot of cases (like when Peter was 35), we don’t have a lot of data and the calcium score by itself just doesn’t add that much. Peter tells his patients that the IV contrast is virtually a non-risk outside of a handful of settings, which are clearly well understood and we know how to handle those pretty well. The radiation these days is low, in the neighborhood of two millisieverts for a person our size. That’s 4% of your annual allotment of radiation. The typical cost is $2,000 to $2,500. Some insurance carriers are able to negotiate a lower rate. The rate is also different at different institutions. Ethan advises patients to shop around. What do you get for your money? What different information do different scanners provide? Different scanners provide different resolution. The amount of radiation exposure is also different. Peter notes this can be 10x different; some scanners expose you to 20 millisieverts (up to 40% of your annual allotment for radiation, which Peter thinks is too much). Ethan points out another layer of complexity‒ how these different tests are applied and getting the information. When Peter orders these CTA scans, he gets beautiful images‒  they’re 3D reconstructed and then they’re 2D sectioned. You’re looking at the lumen, the tube of the artery. In both a CTA and calcium scan, that little speck of calcium shows up in the wall of the artery. You’re also looking for soft plaque, but soft plaque doesn’t show up anywhere in the calcium score. So you can have a significant burden of cardiovascular disease without any calcium; that’s the thing that might gets missed a lot and that shows up in that 15% of people who have a zero calcium score. Another possibility is that where the calcification is placed is not problematic; it’s just that it’s a harbinger of whatever it took to get there. Do you look at patients with a high burden of soft plaque and no calcification as having even higher risk? Ethan thinks a high burden of plaque is a problem, period.",

There were two trials that looked at FFR (fractional flow reserve) in combination with CT-angiography, FAME and FAME 2. FFR is performed in a cath lab; it’s basically a way to detect a pressure gradient across a stenosis. Ethan explains it to patients with this analogy‒ if you take a garden hose and squeeze it, there is pressure proximal to where your finger squeezes the hose, and the pressure on the other end is going to be lower. Effectively what they do is use a wire with a pressure sensor on one end, they put a wire one end of a blockage and another wire on the other end of the blockage and measure the delta. FFR = pressure distal to the lesion ÷ pressure proximal to the lesion. Using a mathematical formula, you can impute the diameter of the artery relative to the diameter of the unobstructed artery (or the garden hose in this analogy), and that gives you a way to get at the severity of the blockage. Ethan thinks of the FFR as high-grade, modest, and low-grade; this has been the #1 tool developed to try to supplement the information you get from that very qualitative assessment of how bad does a lesion look visually.

Ethan thinks it’s plausible. We know that increasing shear forces across the endothelial surface can certainly lead to damage and that would potentially increase calcification. In patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, those who exercise at extreme levels do appear to have an increased rate of calcification of that valve. Ethan qualifies this‒ none of these studies are controlled. He thinks the same could be true in a coronary artery vascular bed. The increasing shear, as you would expect to by increasing flow as you would during extreme exercise, could potentially lead to some damage and therefore calcification. There is the example of people taking statins where there is a disconnect between the amount of calcification in the artery and the amount of risk. It’s incontrovertible that statins probably do increase the risk of calcification despite lowering the risk of events.",

  "content": "We don’t have the 40 years of really rigorous randomized trials showing that some exercising versus some version of placebo increases the risk of calcification. Would Ethan tell some patients not to exercise to that extreme level? He’s on the fence. If a person goes from 50 MET hours per week of exercise to 100, and that increases their calcification, does that increase their risk? Let’s assume that high amounts of cardiorespiratory fitness come at the expense of some endothelial damage (we don’t know if this is true, but it is mechanistically plausible). Let’s assume that risk increased with this increase in exercise, but is that risk more or less than the benefit gained from the additional exercise? Other things that increase the burden of calcification are net negative (smoking more, having higher blood pressure, having worse lipids), and the correction of that works in the same direction as the improvement of the risk modifier. With exercise, it’s not the same. It seems unambiguous that more exercise is better than less, and more calcium is worse than less. Ethan puts this in the context of a patient who has a calcium score of 800. Does this mean anything if the patient exercises a lot? Ethan is not yet comfortable with saying “Don’t worry about that”. Ethan tells patients that we have to assume that that calcium is representative of plaques in the arteries, and that having plaques in the arteries is a bad thing, and we should treat you accordingly even though you exercise a lot. Further, if you want to be sure, have a CT angiogram done to see how much plaque you actually have. Ethan doesn’t know of any evidence that this calcification is not plaque related (extravascular, in the intima or media). “I can’t give you a free pass on the calcium because you exercise a lot”‒ Ethan Weiss. Exercising is great; don’t stop exercising. But the burden of proof is on us to show that that is not risky, and if we did a CT angiogram and it showed you didn’t have any plaque and all the calcium is extravascular somewhere else, then sure, Ethan would be okay with that. But that if we do it and we see plaque, he’s not aware of any data that would say, “Let’s not treat you,” which is the subtle but important difference between the statin story because the people on statins are already by definition on the risk-reducing therapy that’s been shown to save lives. There is still that lever to pull in the exercise person who is statin-naive.",

We had a sort of permissive hypertension in elderly people because we thought they required it; it was just part of the aging process. Only in the past 10+ years have we begun to ask specifically, in well-designed clinical trials, is this the case when it comes to looking at important clinical outcomes. Ethan’s take on this is different than it was 15 years ago; he now thinks that 120/80 mmHg is normal no matter where you are in life and anything above that is abnormal. Ethan tells his patients he wants to get them as close to 120/80 mmHg without harming them. Harms can be in the form of side effects or impact on lifestyle. Toxicity, hyperkalemia, risk of death. It’s not a simple intervention like treating LDL or apoB lower and lower; where there’s really no danger at all of lowering these. There is a consequence of lowering blood pressure too low. Peter asks for clarification, “When blood pressure drifts up to 125, 130, 135, 140 in an aging population, we’re actually calling that pathologic in the same way that I think we would all agree that the reduction in glomerular filtration rate. The reduction in ejection fraction, the reduction in pulmonary function, okay, yes that occurs with aging, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not part of an aging process and therefore part of something we want to minimize. Correct?” Ethan agrees and adds that we lose muscle mass as we age. Is that something we want to accept as normal or do we want to do what we can to preserve the muscle mass we had when we were younger? We need to fall back on what good, high quality clinical trials have shown; it’s not an opinion-based thing. We have evidence that being closer to 120/80 impacts [improves] mortality and that permitting 140/90 (even in an older person), leads to a significant increase in risk of dying.",

It would be great to do a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor (and have this over time serially). This would provide a sense of what the average blood pressure is over a 24-hour period. When you’re sleeping, your blood pressure should be low (that’s physiology). When you’re out and about doing things, it’s going to be higher. A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor can quantify all the spikes. It’s an old-school cuff. Ethan has never seen the device but he imagines that it has some hardware attached to to that tells it to inflate and measure blood pressure just as you would with one that you have in your office. It measures once a minute (or whatever it is) over the course of 24 hours. So it’s constantly inflating, deflating, over the course of the day. Patients of Ethan who’ve worn them say that after a while you get used to it and just can ignore it. We know that hypertension during sleep is abnormal. Sleep should be a time when your blood pressure is the lowest. A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor is another tool we have to get at this question. It’s interesting that we measure blood pressure just once or twice a year and we assume this very variable number is actually meaningful. It’s remarkable that it has been meaningful at all considering the poor sample we are taking. Peter asks his patients to measure their blood pressure twice a day at home, using the method described for at least two weeks once a year. They will measure more if they have reason to do so.",

Then a small step increase in people who had was was then classified as normal. Then a large step increase in people who were considered high normal or even early stage hypertension. But this was a prospective observational study, so the NIH designed a study to prospectively evaluate whether treating people to these two different goals resulted in a change in outcomes. To Ethan’s recollection, there was nothing about the different agents used [in the SPRINT trial] that was meaningful. People got to the two goals they were randomly assigned to, but it wasn’t blinded because you couldn’t be blind to your blood pressure (summarized in the figure below). You can ask the question, was it a benefit of the medicines or was it a benefit of the blood pressure. But the reality is this was a really striking difference such that the NIH stopped the trial early because of benefit in that group with lower blood pressure. “I think it [the SPRINT trial] was one of the most important and practice changing trials that we’ve had.

The generally accepted principle of this is that one of our remarkable advantages of evolution as a species, is our ability to store energy. We have this vast network of subcutaneous adipose tissue (white adipose tissue) that is incredibly adept at storing triglycerides. People have very different genetic capacities for how much fat/energy they can store. Peter likens this to a bathtub. Everybody has a different size bathtub, and the water coming in the bathtub is how much you’re eating, and the water leaving through the drain is how much energy you’re expending. If you’re accumulating fat, you are obviously consuming more than you’re expending. But at some point you could fill that bathtub up, and water can escape the bathtub, and that’s when really bad stuff happens. You don’t need to get a lot of water out of the tub for really bad things to happen (ask anybody who’s had a leak in their house).

Are we not adequately using the tools we already have? Are we missing something else? Is it a combination? Ethan would guess it’s a combination of the two, and this is what he wants to focus the rest of his career thinking about. Peter agrees, it’s a combination.",

He thinks about how little he knows about his own metabolic health, even though he has a good sense from any blood test you can do. A DEXA scan will tell how much VAT (visceral adipose tissue) he has. His transaminases are adequate, so he assumes he has no liver fat. Otherwise, it’s a real blind spot. Ethan points out that we start with the most blunt tool of all (BMI) then move on to other things, but our resolution into metabolic health is still very low.",

  "content": "Ethan’s thought experiment on metabolic health and coronary artery disease. Is the problem with VAT? Is that a defect and the ability to store fat where it should be stored (in the gluteal femoral depot)? Is there something different about VAT? Is there truly a benefit to having more fat in the gluteal femoral? To your bathtub analogy, if you could make a bigger bathtub, would you be more metabolically healthy? Gerald Schulman did an experiment where he looked at a mouse model where the mice had profound insulin resistance and he would just put more and more subcutaneous fat into those mice. And they got fatter and they got less insulin resistance. Paradoxically as they got fatter, they got healthier.",

  "date": "March 20, 2023",
  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "We think that there’s a group of people who represent some polygenic version of this [lipodystrophy] where there’s a relative decrease in fat in the legs. Ethan thinks what we’re going to learn is that gluteal femoral storage capacity is going to be an important driver of risk in this context. And finding ways to change that (if it’s possible) would be of great benefit. If you talk to the plastic surgeons, they’ve begun to understand that there are metabolic consequences to taking fat out of places like the legs and the hips that are very different from taking fat out of the belly. Peter thinks this is also playing a very big role in people who aren’t showing up for bypass at 38-years-old, who don’t have complete lipodystrophy (where they have no ability to store fat on their legs and hips). The question is, are there targeted and directed therapies that can be aimed at the metabolic tip of that spear? This is what Ethan is doing, and he thinks so. They need to do the experiment to demonstrate that. But using human genetics as a guide, there are a large number of alleles that seem to confer this concordance of change in both directions.",

They are common enough that you can find heterozygotes and homozygotes, and it looks like there’s a dose response. Therapies will be tested first in patients with lipodystrophy. Ethan hopes and expects we will move beyond that and try to target other metabolic associated diseases, and ultimately the most metabolic associated disease, which is ASCVD.",

There’ll be some papers coming out soon with collaborators of Ethan’s that will show that the FMR (fat mass ratio) itself conveys more risk even than smoking status. If you have a high FMR (meaning you have a lot of fat up here and not very much fat down here), your risk of significant bad things in the form of coronary disease events is higher than it would be even if you smoked cigarettes.",

Of the single gene mutations that cause disease, the most common is FPLD2 (a mutation in lamin gene), and this leads to progeria, cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophy, and lipodystrophy.",
