Women were castrated by removal of the ovaries to eliminate estrogen to treat breast cancer, it helps in some cases, but not many. If the adrenal gland removal didn’t work, we then would take out the anterior pituitary gland at the base of the brain because that gland produces a hormone that stimulates either the ovary or the testicle to make the responsible hormone. They even started to prophylactically remove the ovaries of those who previously had breast cancer to try to keep it from coming back.",

Picking up in the 1950-1960s, Robert Wilson’s book, Feminine Forever, has encouraged many women to get on estrogen. Premarin was the primary source of estrogen. Premarin, acronym for pregnant mare urine, is still the most used form of estrogen today. In the early 1970s, there was a sharp rise in uterine cancer. Turns out, estrogen, given alone, can increase uterine cancer by 5-fold. So estrogen replacement fell off dramatically. In the late 1970s, it was learned that progesterone together with estrogen, nullified the risk of uterine cancer, so HRT started to increase again. It continued that way until about 2002 when it was estimated that about 16 million women in the United States were taking HRT. Either estrogen alone if they didn’t have a uterus, or the combination, if they did have a uterus. That constituted about 22% of the appropriate age population in the US. By 2004, HRT use was down from 22% to 10% of age appropriate population. By 2010, HRT use fell to 5%. This was largely due to the first publication of the Women’s Health Initiative.",

But this was never a normal population, and as soon as the study came out in 2002, it was immediately extrapolated to all women everywhere. Exclusion of symptomatic women: women who were especially symptomatic were excluded. The reasoning being is that there was a concern that if you took in women who had serious vasomotor symptoms and they were randomized to the placebo, your drop-out rate would be too high. That would be alright, if you acknowledge that up front, says Avrum, but the WHI reported “findings” that HRT had absolutely no benefit on quality of life.

  "content": "The question of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) after a diagnosis of breast cancer is still open without an obvious conclusion. However, some evidence suggests it might not be harmful, and could be beneficial. For example, getting pregnant after having a diagnosis of breast cancer does not compromise the prognosis. There are approximately 15 studies on the subject and only 1 of them showed an increase in breast cancer risk.",
