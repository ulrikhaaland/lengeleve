  "content": "Carol and Avrum’s 2009 paper, Hormone Replacement Therapy: Real Concerns and False Alarms, has a beautiful time course of hormone replacement therapy in women: Figure 2. HRT and Breast Cancer: A timeline of relevant events and studies. Image credit: (Bluming and Tavris, 2009). Men vs. Women: Comparing the early history of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Using the example of how we treated prostate cancer in men with breast cancer in women… The number of women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer is approximately comparable in the United States. And the number of women who die of breast cancer is comparable to the number of men who die of prostate cancer each year. Therefore, the medical establishment made the false leap that testosterone is responsible for prostate cancer and estrogen is therefore responsible for breast cancer. Prostate cancer was treated initially by castration of the testicle ⇒ it doesn’t cure it, but it helps in some cases. So, women were castrated by removal of the ovaries to eliminate estrogen to treat breast cancer ⇒ it helps in some cases, but not many. For prostate cancer, if the castration didn’t work, we stopped and gave palliative care. With breast cancer, if castration didn’t help, we kept removing things… Adrenal glands of women (by the way, adrenal glands make a small percentages of circulating testosterone, but we never removed the adrenal glands of men). Once you remove the adrenal gland, you have to replace the hormones that were necessary for survival, which they did. If the adrenal gland removal didn’t work, we then would take out the anterior pituitary gland at the base of the brain because that gland produces a hormone that stimulates either the ovary or the testicle to make the responsible hormone. We used to do hypophysectomies and while I was in practice, we did that, says Avrum. But again, the anterior pituitary makes many hormones that are necessary for survival so they had to replace many of those hormones. They even started to prophylactically remove the ovaries of those who previously had breast cancer to try to keep it from coming back. And even after all of this, “we didn’t really help too many women with that”. “Let me reiterate, we did nothing like that for men and we hurt a lot of women by doing that. We did it with good intentions, but we hurt them.” Early history of HRT using estrogen. A book in 1968 called Feminine Forever by Robert A. Wilson. The book essentially said women should take estrogen forever and it’ll be an eternal fountain of youth. But that’s not true, that book was oversold, and the doctor who wrote that book was paid for by the drug company who made estrogen. This book did a lot of damage to the trust of community in terms of using estrogen as a treatment. But estrogen did do some very good things… ⇒ First, estrogen can relieve the symptoms of menopause. And it’s not just hot flashes and night sweats, symptoms include: Palpitations cognitive decline joint pains sleep disturbances depression. “It usually lasts about seven and a half years, not two years, and in some women it goes on for decades and women are taught to suck it up and deal with that.” Estrogen and heart disease. In 1991, an article was published: Uncertainty about Postmenopausal Estrogen — Time for Action, Not Debate. It suggested that estrogen is also capable of reducing significant heart disease by up to 50%. “That was 1991 and we now know that estrogen has been shown repeatedly to help diminish the risk for significant heart conditions.”",

  "content": "It has to do with the reduction of progesterone. And in some women, the fall of progesterone during the end of the luteal phase is so rapid (for reasons we don’t understand) it produces a drastic change. Female hormones rapidly decline (not gradual). Women have hormones such as luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and they are coming out of the pituitary and telling the ovaries to make yet more hormones. Then suddenly, during menopause, their production seem to drop off a cliff. Why? ⇒ Evolution may have wanted women to be able to reproduce up to a point and then it turns off the hormones that are responsible for allowing reproduction (i.e. this cycle of rising estrogen, progesterone falling). This is a crucial thing to say, Peter. This is really important. I assumed that in menopause, estrogen declines. I think that’s the way women see it. It just declines the way testosterone declines in a slow, moderate way. No, estrogen plummets to 1% of what it was before menopause. I think most women have no idea that it’s that great a drop in estrogen levels and no wonder that many of the symptoms that women have, which by the way include depression which they’ve attributed to a ‘midlife crisis’. No, it could be an estrogen depletion crisis as well. I think it’s really important for women to understand that this is not just as a little fall off, it’s really a major drop.",

There was so little hesitation in cutting women up, removing this part and removing that part, things that would never have been tried with men. Feminine Forever by Robert Wilson oversold the benefits of estrogen. Robert Wilson was paid by makers of estrogen treatments to write the book. It created even further skepticism. It also created a defiance in the feminist community of “the hell with all of you on this estrogen, I don’t need it, it doesn’t make me feminine forever and who dares to think that I need to be feminine forever in that traditional way!” The routine use of hysterectomy on the assumption that a woman, once she’s had her children, doesn’t need to have her uterus. And by the way, since we’re removing your uterus, let’s remove your ovaries as well because what the hell, they’re just there, let’s take them out as if they have no function.

In many cases, we couldn’t even find what the absolute numbers were.”",

If you accept that, anything that we say at this point is irrelevant. . .but I’ll take your question.” “What has resulted from that is people are saying, ‘Well, the problem really isn’t estrogen.

Every responsible investigator I know wants to make the point that buying something because it’s got the word bioidentical, which sounds comforting, is a mistake.” Premarin (the most common estrogen medication) is an acronym for pregnant mare urine It is the longest studied form of estrogen. We, now, have 60 years of data with Premarin. Most of the studies that show the benefit for estrogen are studies that were done on Premarin Premarin contains at least 10 different forms of estrogen, including some that are the most beneficial forms of estrogen for brain health, which is not present in “bioidentical forms” such as estradiol or estriol. “My preference is Premarin because we have the most data supporting it.” says Avrum ⇒ Progesterone: “As far as progesterone is concerned, micronized bioidentical progesterone appears to be the safest form of progesterone administration.”",

However, bone mineral density a poor substitute but it’s the best we have. The true test is how much a bone can be flexed before it snaps. Calcium and vitamin D help mostly with the outer shell of the bone. But it is the internal girder network of the bone which is important. In a postmenopausal women who is not on estrogen, calcium and vitamin D have no protective effect against hip fracture. Bisphosphonates do help prevent hip fracture almost as well as estrogen does. However, if you take them for longer than five years, you have an increased risk of fractures within the femoral shaft. Estrogen will decrease the risk of osteoporotic hip fracture by up to 50%.
