  "content": "The NYT article was based off of a study suggesting a dose-dependent relationship between increasing daily physical activity 10-30 min and lower risk of death among US adults, regardless of baseline activity level. From 2003 to 2006, 4840 NHANES participants aged 40-85 years were evaluated based on accelerometer data recorded for 7 days. Let me repeat that, the data was recorded for only 7 days. A total of 1165 deaths were reported in the mortality follow-up (mean of 10 years) completed in 2015. The participants were categorized into 8 groups according to the amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) they performed, as measured by accelerometers (i.e. total daily activity of 20-39 minutes, 40-59 minutes, and so on). From a previous publication, they found accelerometer measurements surpassing a certain threshold correlated well with a sustained VO2 expenditure equivalent to MVPA. Activities such as gardening, mowing the lawn, and walking are sufficient to be considered as MVPAs.",

  "content": "The problem is that without critical understanding of the limitations of observational studies, the author of the news article didn’t recognize major flaws to the study. If results from scientific papers are not thoroughly scrutinized and the media further sensationalizes the findings, then they run the serious risk of exacerbating misinformation and causing more harm than good.",

  "title": "The Calculation",
  "date": "April 30, 2022",
  "context": "Exercise & Physical Health",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "To estimate the number of annual deaths prevented from increasing MVPA, the authors basically multiplied the U.S. annual deaths of those aged 40-84 in 2003 with the rate of deaths within each MVPA group and designated the result as the population attributable fraction (PAF). Furthermore, the PAF was calculated by multiplying the prevalence of MVPA in each group with the hazard ratio (HR, or risk of death) of each of the 8 MVPA groups, which were adjusted for covariate factors including age, sex, race, education level, BMI, diet, alcohol use, smoking status, comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, cancer, chronic diseases), mobility limitations, and general health. In other words, these values approximate the likelihood of death given a person’s physical activity level and from demographic factors or disease. From this calculation, the authors concluded that increasing physical activity by 10, 20, or 30 minutes per day was associated with a decrease in U.S. annual deaths of 6.9% (111,174), 13.0% (209,459), and 16.9% (272,297), respectively.",

Comparison of mortality rates in the control and treatment groups would then permit us to draw some conclusions about the causality of any potential effect.",
