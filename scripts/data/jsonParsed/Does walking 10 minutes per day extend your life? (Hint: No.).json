  "content": "A study suggests a dose-dependent relationship between increasing daily physical activity 10-30 min and lower risk of death among US adults, regardless of baseline activity level. From 2003 to 2006, 4840 participants aged 40-85 years were evaluated based on accelerometer data recorded for 7 days. A total of 1165 deaths were reported in the mortality follow-up (mean of 10 years) completed in 2015. The participants were categorized into 8 groups according to the amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) they performed, as measured by accelerometers. Activities such as gardening, mowing the lawn, and walking are sufficient to be considered as MVPAs.",

  "context": "Exercise & Physical Health",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "To estimate the number of annual deaths prevented from increasing MVPA, the authors multiplied the U.S. annual deaths of those aged 40-84 in 2003 with the rate of deaths within each MVPA group and designated the result as the population attributable fraction (PAF). The PAF was calculated by multiplying the prevalence of MVPA in each group with the hazard ratio (HR, or risk of death) of each of the 8 MVPA groups, which were adjusted for covariate factors including age, sex, race, education level, BMI, diet, alcohol use, smoking status, comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, cancer, chronic diseases), mobility limitations, and general health.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "From this calculation, the authors concluded that increasing physical activity by 10, 20, or 30 minutes per day was associated with a decrease in U.S. annual deaths of 6.9% (111,174), 13.0% (209,459), and 16.9% (272,297), respectively. The study claims that approximately 110,000 annual deaths can be prevented if US adults aged 40-85 years increased their moderate-to-vigorous activities by 10 minutes a day.",

  "title": "Study Limitations",
  "date": "April 30, 2022",
  "context": "Exercise & Physical Health",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The study has several limitations. The accelerometer recording lasted for only 7 days. The authors have basically taken one week’s worth of physical activity information and extrapolated it to the participant’s lifetime. Another major concern for this study is the healthy user bias, which occurs when participants of a treatment are healthier because of factors other than the treatment’s effect. Finally, one of the biggest problems with this and nearly all observational studies is the question of correlation vs. causation, a source of virtually limitless misinterpretation and misrepresentation of scientific results.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "When encountering articles with flashy headings that claim doing X will result in Y, it is important to read these pieces with a critical eye. Ensure that the methods are solid and cover what the study aims to prove. Can their methods address the question they’ve posed? Be wary of confounding variables that the authors overlooked. Look for evidence that demonstrates condition X directly causes condition Y. These skills will help you to sort through the piles of articles selling snake oil, and eventually, identifying their flaws can even be fun.",
