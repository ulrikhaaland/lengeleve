  "content": "A study on time-restricted feeding (TRF) looked at 'early TRF' (eTRF), which refers to shifting the feeding window earlier in the day. Participants ate between 8 am and 2 pm each day, in a 4-day randomized crossover study. The control schedule was a feeding window between 8 am and 8 pm. Participants wore continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for part of the study. The eTRF group had lower 24-hour glucose levels, particularly when asleep. Glucose excursions were also reduced during eTRF. Insulin levels were also significantly lower in eTRF compared to control. eTRF tended to increase morning cortisol levels and decrease them at night, suggesting an improvement in circadian rhythm. eTRF induced changes in circadian clock gene expression, affecting 6 out of the 8 circadian genes tested. In particular, eTRF increased both SIRT1 and the autophagy gene LC3A compared to control. The study suggests that avoiding food for several hours before bed may help lower nighttime cortisol and overnight glucose, and possibly improve sleep quality. The eTRF group showed lower glucose, glucose excursion, and insulin levels. They also showed an increased expression in the autophagy gene LC3A, suggesting that more autophagy occurred during eTRF. The SIRT1 gene was also upregulated in the morning during eTRF.",
