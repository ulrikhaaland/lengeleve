Nearsighted means one sees things near well; one sees better up close, and needs glasses to see things at a distance.

  "title": "Presbyopia and Cataract Formation",
  "date": "March 7, 2022",
  "context": "Podcast",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter asks about the person who says they are near and farsighted; is that an accurate statement. No, it’s actually probably that they’re presbyopic, which is that they see well far away. Their focusing ability is compromised, typically through age, and they can’t see up close. Peter is very interested in the details of this because a few years ago this rocked his world, it didn’t happen gradually but seemed to happen overnight. When a person is born, and when they are young, the lens of their eye is extremely elastic. It’s like a gummy bear, and it can change shape to bring near objects into focus. With age, and this is universal, the elasticity of the lens goes down, and one is no longer able to zoom focus in. So one has to start pushing things farther and farther away or get some optical aid like a pair of spectacles to see up close. That process continues as the lens become less elastic and harder, eventually resulting in a cataract where it begins to lose its optical clarity. With a cataract, the lens is stiff, hard, and starts to become opaque. Steven thinks that cataract formation is a universal component of days on earth. He doesn’t recall seeing many people in their 70s without some degree of cataract formation. It starts to become universal. However, there are things that can pathologically prematurely cause cataract formation. Some of them are surprising, like being electrocuted can actually cause premature cataract formation; trauma, head trauma can certainly do it. Typically the eye is in the head, and if the head receives trauma, there’s going to be a certain amount of trauma in the eye itself. Peter clarifies, the point is, it doesn’t have to be direct trauma to the eye. Forces of the brain are presumably also being reverberated through the vitreous fluid. The eye is a fluid-containing organ, and when it receives trauma, those same forces come to bear on the eye itself. It is more common to develop cataracts when one has direct eye trauma, but even head trauma alone can predispose someone to cataract formation. Certainly, diabetes is a cause of premature cataract formation. Steroid use, corticosteroid use can lead to cataract formation.",

That protein does not turn over or exchange, but the membrane (the candy coating, the so-called lens capsule) can allow molecules to diffuse in and out. A classic example of this— someone will point out, hey, my vision, my glasses prescription suddenly changed; they became much more nearsighted, or farsighted in the space of a month.

The timeframe for that to happen is over a period of several weeks. If the blood sugar goes up there may be a lag of a month or two before the vision change.

This is a lipoic acid choline ester; the safety study was just published. Yes, and the onset of cataract. At the moment it’s in the early experimental phase. This compound must be applied in a topical fashion. So putting in an eyedrop and that drop has to run the gauntlet of going through the cornea, which has lipid layers and water-soluble layers. It’s got to get through all that into the aqueous humor in the front and then through the lens capsule into the lens to actually do its work. That’s why this particular drug or compound is a choline ester, because that allows it to get through that lipid layer in the front, through the water-soluble portion of the cornea, and then hopefully into the lens itself. This is not easy to do; the lens is a relatively privileged area, both from an immunological, but also a pharmacological standpoint.",

If one can make the pupil small pharmacologically and get it into the sweet spot (which is probably about 1.6 millimeter) one can suddenly see up close again. This expands the depth of focus.

The theoretical limit of how well one can see is defined by essentially the pixelation of their retina. This is the spacing of the cells of those photoreceptors discussed earlier. This varies from person to person, but it’s somewhere in the vicinity of about 20/08 or so. With a sharp enough image, one could theoretically see better than 20/10.

But then the eye begins to regard that contact lens as a foreign object. So one’s body just begins to attack it, coat it with all sorts of immunological debris. One is susceptible to pollen, dust, whatever it is that coats this formerly pristine object. And let’s say there is correction for astigmatism in that contact lens, where its orientation is important. Every time one blinks, that contact lens moves a little bit. All of those factors contribute to optical performance that is less than what could be achieved with spectacles or laser vision correction.

Since the length of the eye cannot be changed; what can be changed is the curvature of the front of the eye. The curvature doesn’t have to change that much; think about how thin a contact lens is.

  "content": "Long before this patient ever laid down on this gurney to have this laser treatment done, their eye was digitally mapped using what is referred to as a wavefront sensing device. A known uniform beam of light is sent in and he looks at how it bounces back from the back of the eye. That reveals what are the distortions present in this eye; how much nearsightedness, farsightedness… Diagnostically, this is part of the workup for laser vision correction. They look at how a particular eyeball distorts light as it goes through the optical pathway. This technology was developed for telescopes that have to contend with atmospheric distortion, like the Keck. In the eye they have the benefit of not having to deal with real time, evolving distortion, but he can take a snapshot of what the distortions are in the eyeball. Part of that involves the ability to track the eye. They have to lock onto, and register the eye with the equipment. The laser can track any movement one makes far more rapidly than it is possible to move the eye. It doesn’t matter if the patient’s eyes are moving during this diagnostic because the laser is moving. The fear of the patient, “I’m going to mess it up.” is not a ridiculous fear; it’s universal. Steven tells patients, “Hey, I’m not going to let you do anything to mess this up” The laser will not fire unless the patient is within its range of tracking, and the laser will move faster than the patient can move. So PRK is changing the shape of the eye by vaporizing the tissue. It’s a laser that’s scanning around the cornea where it does a little treatment here and there. Thermally one doesn’t want to do another shot right next to the previous one, so it moves over to another area to let the tissue cool down for a few milliseconds. This takes anywhere from 15 seconds to 2 minutes. The worse the prescription is, the longer it takes. So a -10 would take a minute or so. It depends on the laser and the overall treatment size. This fixes the astigmatism and all the little distortions. He measures all the little optical distortions, the coma and trefoil (terms optical physicists are very familiar with), and does his best to eliminate them with laser vision correction. For PRK this takes 2-3 minutes, plus the Valium time. The patient takes Valium a half an hour before; it works pretty quickly when they chew it.",

But another step is introduced in the procedure, the flap; if the flap is not performed correctly, it can lead to problems. There is more dry eye following LASIK compared to PRK. Some people have data to show that dry eye is equal in patients receiving LASIK and PRK, but he thinks there is more dry eye following LASIK; it’s controversial. The majority of patients are back to their baseline in about 60 to 90 days.",

So this is a pressure related optic neuropathy. Glaucoma is not known to have any symptoms until the very end. The peripheral vision is damaged at the end of glaucoma. Most people will not detect a slight reduction in their peripheral vision, particularly if it’s segmental. There will be just a little area off to the side that they can’t see. But as glaucoma progresses, it can affect central vision, and then it becomes symptomatic. Luckily glaucoma has become much more treatable. The pharmacological management of glaucoma has gotten way better. And there are numerous laser procedures that can treat glaucoma, what are referred to as minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS).",

It runs in families, so there is a family history component but it’s not simple heredity. It is not coupled with diabetes. There’s some relationship to hypertension, blood pressure; but it can be seen in patients who are not hypertensive at all. It’s very common.",
