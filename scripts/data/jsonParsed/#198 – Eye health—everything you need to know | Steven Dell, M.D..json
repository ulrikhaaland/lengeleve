The next thing is the pupil, which is the hole in the iris. Behind that is the lens, it’s really one of a couple of different lenses inside the eye; but the lens behind the pupil. Then there is the vitreous cavity and in the very back. The retina, which attaches to the optic nerve, and that’s what goes to the brain. Images come in; they’re bent by the cornea first, then bent again by the lens, and then they focus (hopefully) on the retina. In a perfectly sized eye, in someone who doesn’t need spectacles to see, images come from say, optical infinity, which is for the purposes of this discussion, is about 20 feet or beyond where light rays come in parallel, and they’re bent so that they fall perfectly on the retina.",

The theoretical limit of how well one can see is defined by essentially the pixelation of their retina. This varies from person to person, but it’s somewhere in the vicinity of about 20/08 or so. With a sharp enough image, one could theoretically see better than 20/10.

There are two drivers of nearsightedness in the plastic developing human: 1) Deprivation from outdoor light 2) Near work. The risk of nearsightedness can be cut in half by going outside. The light is really the most important driver of protection from nearsightedness. So if one is outside on a bright sunny day, they’re releasing a fair bit of dopamine from the retina and dopamine inhibits the growth of the eye.

It’s really the UV filter that is helpful in terms of protection of eye health. One could wear clear spectacles, as long as they had UV protection, and still achieve the benefit of sunglasses. It’s not the tint that protects the eyes; it’s the ultraviolet protection. The same is true for car windows.",

The way this came about was an engineer at IBM realizes that excimer lasers, used to etch microchips, could also be used to change the curvature or make cuts in human tissue. And because of the nature of this ultraviolet laser, there was essentially no bystander trauma to the adjacent tissue, so the tissue could be etched or cut. Further, because it generated no heat, there was typically no immune response generated, so these incisions would heal without scarring.",

The curvature doesn’t have to change that much; think about how thin a contact lens is. Only a little curvature needs to change in order to focus the light on the retina. PRK does this with an excimer laser on the very front part of the cornea. The very front coating of the cornea is called the epithelium. He removes that layer of cells with a solution of alcohol eye drops; it just sloughs right off, and it grows back in the same configuration. Then he uses a very carefully calibrated laser to change the shape of the cornea.",

But as glaucoma progresses, it can affect central vision, and then it becomes symptomatic. Luckily glaucoma has become much more treatable.
