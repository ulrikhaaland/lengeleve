There’s a well-studied phenomenon called metabolic endotoxemia. The gut microbiome has a huge role in regulation of weight (independent of calories). Our low fiber, high sugar, high processed food diets increase bad bugs in the gut. Antibiotics, acid blockers, antiinflammatory drugs, hormones all screw up our gut as well. And environmental toxins, such as glyphosate, is super toxic to the microbiome. They start to disrupt the gut microbiome. They disrupt the lining of the gut. This allows the absorption of bacterial products, bacterial toxins as well as food antigens. And they start to create an inflammatory response. This is partly a problem because about 60% of your immune system is in your gut. At least a third of our metabolites in our blood may be from microbiome. And these non-human bacteria that are regulating your immune system, activating your mitochondria, regulating your DNA, affecting your brain chemistry (mood), and affecting all sorts of diseases.

Rhona Applebaum (VP at Coca-Cola) ran GEBN and she found a bunch of scientists (like James Hill) who she could co-op, paid them lots of money, and funded research to actually promote the idea that all calories are the same.

The explosion in crop yield was a combination of nitrogen-based fertilizer, crop rotation, industrial farming, and selective breeding.

That way, the plants will survive getting sprayed but the weeds will die. Why might GMOs be problematic? First, it MIGHT be harmful to be eating an organism that now has a gene that looks different from the gene that we evolved to consume it. Secondly, it enables the use of chemicals (e.g., RoundUp/glyphosate) in a higher concentration than you would be able to use them in the absence of genetic modifications to the plant. In other words, the food is getting exposed to Roundup (glyphosate) and it may be harmful for people to be consuming that.
