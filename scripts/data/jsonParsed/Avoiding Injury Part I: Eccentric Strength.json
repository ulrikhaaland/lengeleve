  "content": "Accidental injury is among the leading causes of death in the developed world, and even when an injury itself is not directly responsible for ending one’s life, the associated debilitation can hasten the onset and progression of other health concerns. Although falls and other accidents are typically sudden and unexpected events, we can nevertheless take steps to make them less likely to occur – and to make them less severe when they do happen.",

  "title": "Importance of Eccentric Strength",
  "date": "July 23, 2022",
  "context": "Stability",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Eccentric strength is the strength associated with muscle lengthening, as opposed to concentric strength, which is the strength associated with muscle contraction. During eccentric movements, muscles act as shock absorbers and braking systems against external forces such as gravity, and the importance of this function for the prevention of falls and injuries can’t be overstated. This ability to use muscles for deceleration and controlled movement also reduces force experienced by joints, providing yet another means of avoiding injury.",

  "context": "Stability",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Despite its importance, eccentric strength is a less intuitive concept than concentric strength, which may explain why it’s so often missing from training regimens. The links throughout this newsletter are intended to provide more information on eccentric strength and how it plays a role in overall stability and injury avoidance, and below I’ve included a few links to short video clips with specific exercises for eccentric strength training.",
