  "content": "Time restriction (TR) possibly contains the simplest dietary prescription: limit your eating to a window of X hours. For example, “Only eat between noon and 8 pm each day.” Most people are already doing something like a 10/14 TRF schedule, even without a modicum of effort (i.e., not eating for 10 hours; eating within a 14-hour window).",

  "content": "The metabolic flexibility experienced with TRF is certainly on par with what is experienced during a longer journey in nutritional ketosis. For example, though eating only one (large) meal per day at dinner, one can work up to doing a 6-hour very tough bike ride on nothing but water in the first half of the day.",
