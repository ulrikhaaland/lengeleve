  "content": "Research is being conducted on lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis. The focus is on the metabolism and function of high density lipoproteins (HDLs). HDL biology is much more complex than LDL biology. People generally think of HDL as the “good cholesterol”. In this discussion, the biology of the HDL, its genesis, its origin, its metabolism, its life cycle, and its function are discussed. It also covers why it has been so complicated to use pharmacologic interventions on the HDL side to impact atherosclerosis. The greatest success of modern medicine, especially as it comes to cardiovascular disease, has been the ability to manipulate the apoB side of the equation as opposed to the apoA side of the equation.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There are two families of lipids‒ the apoB family and the apoA family. Lipoproteins are these big complexes that evolved to transport lipids within the blood. Lipoproteins have lipid in their core, and then they have proteins that dot the surface. The proteins allow them to be transported in very complex and sophisticated ways within the bloodstream. ApoB lipoproteins evolved to transport triglycerides as a source of energy, from the gut to adipose and muscle and heart, as well as from the liver (during times when we’re fasting). They’re very important in terms of causal relationship to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). HDL is a very complex lipoprotein. HDL doesn’t have this key protein apoB. HDL is characterized by a different protein called apoA-I. HDL also transports cholesterol and other complex lipids.",

It is a core protein of HDL, but unlike apoB, there are several molecules of apoA-I on any given HDL particle (anywhere from 1-4, maybe more). ApoA-I doesn’t stay with the particle, it can exchange onto other types of HDL particles, but even sometimes onto apoB lipoproteins. In the last decade we have learned that apoA-I is a secreted protein put into the blood by either the intestinal enterocyte or the hepatocyte in the liver as a free protein (more or less). One of the first steps that has to happen for HDL to be formed is that once HDL comes out of the cell, it engages with a key transport protein called ABCA1.",

Once you start getting below mammals, things change in terms of lipoprotein metabolism. There are thoughts that HDL is the primordial lipoprotein that evolved early as a transport system for lipids within circulatory systems in lower species. And that the apoB system evolved subsequently. Many animals (mice, dogs, pics, rabbits) make apoB in both the gut and liver. So it’s not that these species don’t have apoB.

Mammals evolved apoB to efficiently capture fats in the diet for energy purposes. Absent lifestyle things that raise apoB, it simply increases with aging. As we age, the apoB concentration goes up; we are less efficient in clearing apoB from circulation.",

People who lack apoA-V have really high triglycerides and are at major risk for ASCVD.

The foam cell (the lipid loaded macrophage) is a core pathologic feature of atherosclerotic vascular disease, and it’s also the first thing you see. Macrophages have very well-established mechanisms for ridding themselves of cholesterol. Keep in mind, no cell (except the liver cell) has the ability to metabolize cholesterol to other sterol species. Cells can make plenty of cholesterol, but the only way cells can deal with their cholesterol is to efflux the cholesterol‒ to push the cholesterol out of the cell and get rid of it.",

Questions remain about cholesterol efflux and how to target this clinically. One person with an HDL cholesterol of 50 might have something about their HDL pathway that is super functional at driving efflux, whereas, another person with the same HDL cholesterol doesn’t do nearly as well.
