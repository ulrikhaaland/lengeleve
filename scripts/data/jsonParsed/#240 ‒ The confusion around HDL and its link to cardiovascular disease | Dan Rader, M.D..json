In this discussion we really talk about everything from the biology of the HDL, its genesis, its origin, its metabolism, its life cycle, to its function. We also talk about why it has been so complicated to use pharmacologic interventions on the HDL side of the equation to impact atherosclerosis. We speak about CETP inhibitors, which are a class of drug that have been repeatedly used to try to increase HDL cholesterol with the hopes that that would reduce cardiovascular disease. We end the conversation around some of the new thinking around HDL and neurodegenerative disease.",

HDLs are acted upon by lipases. Lipoprotein lipase is an example, and it’s critically important for triglyceride metabolism and energy metabolism. Two close cousins to lipoprotein lipase are (1) hepatic lipase and (2) endothelial lipase. As their names suggest, they are each made in different places, but they both chew on phospholipids on the HDL. This results in modification of the phospholipid composition of the HDL particle, and each has different effects. These change the protein composition of the HDLs in ways we don’t fully understand. They also have other important biological effects that we don’t fully understand. These lipases evolved for some reason ( Dan will come back to when we talk about the CNS at the end). The one thing Dan knows is that lipases are really critical for HDL metabolism. Another protein that is very relevant to HDL is cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). CETP transfers cholesteryl esters between apoB-containing lipoproteins and HDL. CETP is a major modifier of the HDL particle in terms of its size and composition. People who lack CETP have hugely elevated HDL cholesterol levels (way over 100). That told us that CETP siphons cholesterol out of HDL, and when you don’t have CETP, you have a lot more cholesterol in HDL. Mice don’t have CETP; this is one difference between mice and humans.

The positive valence of HDL as a particle is because of this function. According to this theory, the more effective you are at picking up cholesterol (efflux) and returning it to the liver for secretion, the more you protect against atherosclerosis.",

  "content": "If you interrupt that process, HDL goes up, but the process of reverse cholesterol transport is being constipated, and therefore, there’s increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. One of the great goals of the field has been‒ can we promote that first step of this process? Can we figure out a way to promote the process of cholesterol efflux from the macrophages (and maybe other cells in the atherosclerotic plaque) to acceptors like HDL in order to protect or even regress atherosclerotic plaque, as a way of trying to reduce risk? HDL is almost certainly not the particle that is driving this first step of the efflux of cholesterol from the foam cell and the macrophage. That is maybe why simplistically raising HDL cholesterol (like with CTP inhibition) doesn’t actually reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. Questions remain about cholesterol efflux and how to target this clinically. But are there other ways more creatively that we might be able to drive that process? Might it be that different people (even with identical HDL cholesterol levels) have different function of their HDL? If we could measure function efficiently, might we have a better way of assessing risk and maybe even targeting interesting therapies more so than just measuring this fairly not so dynamic measure of HDL cholesterol itself?",

  "date": "January 30, 2023",
  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Back to reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), how often is it happening that an apoB-bearing lipoprotein (an LDL for example), is floating around, not yet in an artery wall, and a HDL comes along, collides in the artery itself, dilapidation takes place, and the HDL takes some of the cholesterol back to the liver? Dan doesn’t think this scenario occurs that often. As discussed with CETP, the directional flux of cholesterol in the blood is more from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins rather than the other way around. It’s more likely that there is something about HDL/ apoA-I interacting with cells to promote efflux of cholesterol rather than interacting with other lipoproteins (like apoB lipoproteins). Dan then developed what he calls an ex vivo cholesterol efflux assay. You start with a blood sample, and isolate HDL (get rid of the apoB-containing lipoproteins). Next, put this HDL on cells that were labeled with cholesterol. Then, measure the effectiveness by which that HDL removes cholesterol from these cells. Dan was struck with the differences in the ability of HDLs for extracting cholesterol from cells when comparing HDLs from different individuals, even between individuals that had the same HDL cholesterol level.",

So apoA-I somehow gets to the brain through the blood. There is a lot of observational data that strongly suggest that apoA-I is protective against neurodegenerative disease. Dan thinks this is plausible because two of the major genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s that are expressed in the brain are ABCA1 and ABCA7. ABCA1 is that lipid transporter that rids cells of cholesterol, and apoA-I  interacts with it and promotes it. ABCA7 is a very close relative of ABCA1 that structurally looks very similar, but we don’t know exactly what it does. Dan thinks it’s a safe bet that ABCA7 is transporting some sort of lipid to something in the extracellular space (whether that’s apoA-I or apoE or something else). So the plausibility of apoA-I being protective against neurodegenerative disease, particularly Alzheimer’s, is quite high.",

Dan thinks this is because measuring apoE (in total plasma) isn’t that helpful in the limited clinical studies that have been done. You would need to take a CSF sample because the levels of apoE in the CSF and blood do not correlate much at all (in the few studies that have measured it in both blood and CSF).
