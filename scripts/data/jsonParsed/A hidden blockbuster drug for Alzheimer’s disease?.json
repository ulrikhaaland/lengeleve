  "content": "Pfizer's rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Enbrel could potentially reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by 64%. Pfizer found this out in 2015 by going through medical insurance claims, identifying people with RA and dividing the patients into two groups of 127,000 each: one group of patients with an AD diagnosis and the other group without. In 2016, a study was published yielding results very similar to Pfizer's internal findings. It found that Enbrel was associated with a decreased risk of AD in RA patients (unadjusted odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI 0.08-0.94; p = 0.03).",

  "content": "Pfizer chose not to take Enbrel any further, nor did they make the data public. Researchers in one of Pfizer's divisions suggested that for a mere $80 million Pfizer could have designed a clinical trial to test this question in the only way it can be answered—prospectively with randomization. Pfizer is not pouncing on an opportunity to sell a drug that might reduce AD risk by 0.15%.",

  "content": "The majority of people taking Enbrel have RA. In that 2016 study, the prevalence of AD in over 9,000 RA patients ≥ 65 years-old was 3% compared to 1.4% for patients without RA. If Enbrel truly does reduce the risk of AD by ~60% in this population, it might bring the prevalence down to 1.2%, which would obviously be wonderful, but what Enbrel does for someone with RA may be entirely different than what it does for someone without it.",

In other words, the failure rate was 99.6%. Hard to imagine it’s improved much since 2014.)",

There is no evidence anti-TNF drugs like Embrel are reversing AD. So, at best, a drug for prevention better be pretty inexpensive, pretty safe, and pretty easy to disseminate widely for decades before a disease takes hold.",

In patients without, 302 out of 127,000, or 0.24%. The absolute difference is thus, 0.24% less -0.09%, or 0.15%. For the purists out there, this is only an estimate since the cohorts were matched and not random, but it’s likely in the ballpark.",
