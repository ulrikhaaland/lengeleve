  "content": "Pfizer’s rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Enbrel, a substance that inhibits an inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-ɑ), could potentially reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The drug company found in 2015 that Enbrel appeared to reduce the risk of AD by 64%. They went through medical insurance claims, identified people with RA and divided the patients into two groups of 127,000 each: one group of patients with an AD diagnosis and the other group without. Then they looked at how many people in each group had taken Enbrel. In the AD diagnosis group, there were 110 people treated with Enbrel. In the group without AD, 302. This difference of nearly 3x, given identical denominators, gives you an intuitive sense of why the reduction is approximately ⅔.",

  "content": "A study published in 2016 yielded results very similar to Pfizer’s internal findings. Investigators looked at 8.5 million insurance claims data to determine the risk of AD among RA patients and whether anti-TNF drugs (including Enbrel) for RA was associated with a lower risk of AD. It found that Enbrel was associated with a decreased risk of AD in RA patients (unadjusted odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI 0.08-0.94; p = 0.03). In English, this means a decreased (relative) risk of 67% with a 3% chance of this being “luck” and not “real” in statistical terms. The authors concluded that etanercept (i.e., Enbrel) “is a promising candidate for the treatment of AD in the future.”",

  "content": "The majority of people taking Enbrel have RA. In that 2016 study, the prevalence of AD in over 9,000 RA patients ≥ 65 years-old was 3% compared to 1.4% for patients without RA. That’s more than double the rate. If Enbrel truly does reduce the risk of AD by ~60% in this population, it might bring the prevalence down to 1.2%, which would obviously be wonderful, but what Enbrel does for someone with RA may be entirely different than what it does for someone without it.",

In other words, the failure rate was 99.6%. Hard to imagine it’s improved much since 2014.",

  "content": "Maybe anti-TNF drugs have a role in AD. But for this to be true, it would likely require a longer exposure during the pre-AD phase of a person’s life. There is no evidence anti-TNF drugs like Embrel are reversing AD. So, at best, a drug for prevention better be pretty inexpensive, pretty safe, and pretty easy to disseminate widely for decades before a disease takes hold.",
