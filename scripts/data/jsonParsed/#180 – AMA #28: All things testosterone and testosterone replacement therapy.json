Two dominant carrier proteins for testosterone are sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. SHBG is responsible for about two-thirds of the carrying capacity, whereas albumin is about one-third. It's only the unbound portion of testosterone that is able to actually exert the biological influence.",

LH and FSH are released from the anterior pituitary gland into the bloodstream and their targets are two specific types of cells in the testes. The net result of this is the production of testosterone. When testosterone is low, the feedback cycle to the brain ultimately is to ramp up the secretion of LH and FSH. Conversely, when testosterone is high, the signal that’s sent back is to inhibit the production of these things.",

The most common thing that we see clinically that results in that picture, i.e., low testosterone, but with an inappropriately low LH and FSH, is sleep deprivation and hypercortisolemia, i.e., Lots of stress. And that can result in the brain not sending the right signal to the testes. That’s important from a clinical perspective because how we treat low testosterone—and when we do make the decision to treat—it is highly dependent on being able to differentiate between those two paths.",

But for males, the very lowest dose, I would see having any efficacy would be about 50 milligrams weekly, but typically it’s about a hundred to 120 weekly. In our practice, for men who are using testosterone, we would prescribe it twice a week, subcutaneously. So you would take the weekly dose if it’s a hundred and instead you would take 50 every three and a half days, or basically you’d go twice a week. We even have some patients who are fine doing this daily. And so they’ll take one seventh of a weekly dose subcutaneously every single day.",

However, Peter believes that the study hasn't been retracted and has problems with it. The group that received testosterone replacement therapy had a 52% relative risk reduction in all events or a 10.1% absolute risk reduction.",

There were just so many repeated errors in this study, including the statistical correction, the accidental inclusion of 10% women in a study of men, etc. In response to these errors, 29 international medical societies and more than 160 physician-scientists from 32 countries petitioned JAMA to retract this article, citing “gross data mismanagement and contamination” that rendered the study “no longer credible.” The FDA was forced to look at this, but they ultimately concluded that this study was so limited that they could not attribute the reported findings to testosterone treatment.",

  "content": "A retrospective study of a health insurance database that reported rates of nonfatal MI in the period up to 90 days after a T prescription and compared these rates to MI rates in the previous 12 months. Essentially they looked at the moment someone got a testosterone prescription and looked at, What was the risk of a non-fatal MI in those 90 days. And how does it compare to the rates of MI in the previous 12 months for the same patient? The authors reported the rate ratio of MI post-prescription to pre-prescription was 1.36, and the rate in men older than 65 years was 2.19. In short, that would mean that in all men, there was a 36% increase in MI. And in older men, it was a more than doubling in the risk of EMI. The FDA wrote that it’s “difficult to attribute” the increased risk for non-fatal MI seen in the Finkel study to testosterone alone and not consider that the study participants might have remained hypogonadic and thus had higher risk for non-fatal MI. In other words, this study didn’t have a control group who were untreated so you have no idea if that change in MI rate should be compared to something that is better or worse. We don’t actually know if these MIs were higher, lower, or unchanged with respect to testosterone.",

The meta-analysis paper also looked at some observational studies, which showed no increase in mortality or cardiovascular mortality. However, these studies were small and underpowered, and a large, well-done randomized controlled trial is needed. The TRAVERSE trial is a five-year trial with 6,000 participants using AndroGel for this trial, and the primary endpoint is Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).",
