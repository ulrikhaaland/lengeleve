  "content": "Testosterone is a steroid hormone derived from the cholesterol family and it exerts its effect through binding to an androgen receptor. It is only the unbound portion of testosterone that is able to exert the biological influence. Testosterone influences gene expression and is responsible for a number of things, including the anabolic or growth characteristics. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is another important hormone that is about three to six times more powerful than testosterone.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The body naturally regulates testosterone levels through a feedback loop involving the central nervous system, specifically the hypothalamus. In response to low testosterone, the hypothalamus secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone which triggers the anterior pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones target specific types of cells in the testes, resulting in the production of testosterone. When testosterone is low, the feedback cycle to the brain is to ramp up the secretion of LH and FSH. Conversely, when testosterone is high, the signal is to inhibit the production of these hormones.",

From clinical experience, that’s a very normal physiologic dose of testosterone. Probably the lowest dose I’ve ever seen a male patient take is about 50 milligrams weekly. But for males, the very lowest dose, I would see having any efficacy would be about 50 milligrams weekly, but typically it’s about a hundred to 120 weekly. So 200, every two weeks is on that kind of normal, low end dose. For what it’s worth, I’ve never been a fan of intramuscular dosing and or dosing at every two weeks, because the half-life is three and a half, four days. And therefore you tend to have a very high peak and then a period of having normal doses, and then you kind of fall off. In our practice, for men who are using testosterone, we would prescribe it twice a week, subcutaneously. So you would take the weekly dose if it’s a hundred and instead you would take 50 every three and a half days, or basically you’d go twice a week. We even have some patients who are fine doing this daily. And so they’ll take one seventh of a weekly dose subcutaneously every single day.",

Conversely, the other two figures show basically mirrored graphs. In other words, the testosterone and the testosterone plus finasteride graph are basically the same graph, which suggests that the effect we’re looking at is due to testosterone and not dihydrotestosterone. We saw about a four kilogram increase in lean mass—that’s not a trivial amount in three years, especially for men of that age (~71 years)—that’s about nine pounds of lean mass that was added during three years. In terms of fat mass, they lost close to 10 pounds.

Most urologists are more optimistic that there is no relationship between prostate cancer and testosterone replacement therapy. However, in men who are non-surgical candidates for prostate cancer, who undergo chemical castration, we have to wait at least five years before we would consider replacing testosterone in those patients.",
