  "content": "THC is not a good sleep aid for teenagers as their brain is still developing. In adults, THC does make you fall asleep faster, reducing sleep latency, but like alcohol, it blocks REM sleep. With regular use of THC, you start to lose the sleep latency benefit and many people get 'rebound insomnia' when they try to quit using it.",

  "content": "There's not enough data yet on CBD as a sleep aid, although the data is more promising than THC. Early data shows that CBD might help in falling asleep faster and it does not have the same negative impact on REM sleep. It might also benefit some sleep disorders like reducing severity of sleep apnea and helping PTSD-related sleep problems. However, it's dose dependent and the optimal dose is not clear yet. There's a hypothesis that CBD may decrease your core body temperature, leading to better sleep. Another hypothesis is that it has indirect benefits through its reduction of anxiety, a major cause of insufficient or poor sleep.",
