THC does make you fall asleep faster (reduces sleep latency), but like alcohol, it blocks REM sleep. With regular use of THC, you start to lose the sleep latency benefit, and if you try to quit using it, many people get “rebound insomnia”.",

Early tentative preliminary evidence suggests it does not have the same negative impact on REM. Also fewer dependency issues and don’t get insomnia rebound. CBD might also benefit some sleep disorders. Might reduce severity of sleep apnea. Might also help PTSD-related sleep problems.",
