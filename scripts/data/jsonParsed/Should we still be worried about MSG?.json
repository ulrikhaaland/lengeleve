  "content": "Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a widely used food additive that has been the subject of controversy over its safety. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated MSG as a Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) ingredient in 1958. Despite requests over the years to remove the GRAS designation, the FDA kept it on the list given the available evidence. There’s no evidence to substantiate the claim that MSG causes ill effects in most people who consume it. A minority of people are hypersensitive to glutamate and MSG in food—added or natural—and in a study where MSG was given at 3 grams, in the absence of food, sensitive individuals had short-term, transient adverse reactions.",

  "content": "MSG is the sodium salt of an amino acid called glutamic acid. Glutamic acid is a nonessential amino acid, meaning that our bodies can produce it. The sodium salt form of glutamic acid both occurs naturally and synthetically—it makes food taste extra tasty. MSG is not high in sodium and actually allows for far less added salt given its flavor-enhancing properties. It contains one-third the amount of sodium as sodium chloride (table salt), about 12% versus 39%.",

  "content": "The syndrome refers to the complex of symptoms, often attributed to MSG, like burning sensations in the mouth, facial pressure, headache, maybe some chest pain. However, symptoms occur after eating “Chinese” restaurant food with added MSG, but not in others—further suggests the entire argument is devoid of merit.",

  "content": "In the late 1960s, research on infant mice found that MSG had toxic effects on the brain and it was associated with other health issues. However, the levels of MSG that were found to be toxic resulted from force feeding over a short time period, so the data’s applicability to human infants in real-life situations was unclear, and many other studies could not replicate these results. Almost no ingested MSG passes the blood-brain barrier, meaning that dietary MSG does not gain access to the brain. Decades of research demonstrated no danger from MSG consumption. Many separate scientific reviews concluded that concentrations of MSG in food are not hazardous to human health.",
