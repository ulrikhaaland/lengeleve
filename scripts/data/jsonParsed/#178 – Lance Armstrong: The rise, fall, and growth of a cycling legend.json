Finally, Lance recounts some of favorite stories from his cycling career, reflects on his legacy, and explains how he stays fit at age 50.",

It was an age group team. There are different categories; the most serious is age group swimming That’s where Michael Phelps grew up swimming. On one end of the spectrum is country club summer leagues. One swims some laps, has a few meets, all the parents are there. There is high school swimming. Then, the most serious training is age group swimming. At 12 Lance didn’t know how to swim. He could have faked freestyle but didn’t know any strokes. He showed up and the coach stuck him with the six- and seven-year-olds. Thinking back, he never questioned it; he just stayed swimming. After a month of that, he moved over a lane and was with the 8-year-olds; then a month later he moved over again. He just kind of kept going across the pool until less than a year later, he was a legit swimmer. It’s still one of his great loves. Peter asks if he is swimming for both high school and age group competitions. Yes and no. He turned pro in triathlons at 15.",

He said the doctors didn’t seem to have concerns about blood clotting at those levels. Lance comments that people on Everest have a hematocrit of 70. Was there a noticeable difference from 1994? Oh yeah; it’s a very effective substance. Was it being used as often in the one-day races as it was in the grand tour? Yes. It would help you on Paris-Roubaix as much as any race. One’s getting 10% more hemoglobin or hematocrit. One’s also getting at threshold 10% more power. Power meters  – Lance first started using the SRM in ‘98. Lance’s functional threshold power in 1999.

In ’98 he went back out to shop teams; there was almost zero interest. He negotiated $200K as a base and performance bonuses, $1000 per UCI point. He competed in Paris-Nice in ‘98 but quit due to the weather and the crosswind of the peloton. Part of Lance just wanted to sit around and eat tacos all day and TexMex.",

Never meeting your father and having this man around. Never having that figure in your life, and the figure that was there was wildly defective. He doesn’t think 15-year old Lance would have listened to anyone coming with advice. Going back to the question, even then at 15, he drove a fast car and every green light was a competition.
