Normally it shuts down at night and that’s part of the mechanism of what we call the sleep-wake switch. Orexin, like many other hormones and chemicals, seem to be under the control of our 24 hour circadian rhythm which is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Another part of regulation of orexin is independent of your sleep-wake, it’s actually dependent on your body’s energy balance. When animals go under conditions of starvation, these orexin cells sense the change in the energy balance and they start dumping out more orexin which forces the animal artificially awake for a longer period of time. In humans under conditions of fasting, Matt thinks you are giving the body an ancient, evolutionary signal of starvation which causes the brain to dump more orexin into the system and therefore your sleep becomes compressed. *Partial explanation for why sleep metrics improve while in a fasted state:",

Matt is not aware of any literature showing good causal evidence that magnesium supplementation actually improves someone’s sleep. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, so if good scientific studies are done, we may find it helps. The placebo effect is one of the most reliable effects in all of pharmacology, so if you think that magnesium is giving you a benefit to the quality of your sleep, maybe there’s no harm in it.

  "date": "September 7, 2020",
  "context": "Sleep",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Matt says there is evidence starting to emerge about how sleep deprivation leads to poor gut health. Early data is showing that when you sleep deprive either human beings or animals, you see a shift in the gut microbiome balance away from the bacterial bent and more towards the fermented bent of the microbiome. That shift is interesting because there’s an association between poor health outcomes and a gut microbiome with a fermented bent. Using that logic, sleep deprivation is pushing you into a gut microbiome profile that is not optimal. Another experiment mimicked jet lag and it also produced that same deleterious shift towards the fermented gut. More recent data comes from a Harvard paper—If you sleep deprive fruit flies (and rats), they will die. But this study investigated what could be killing the fruit flies when they’re deprive of sleep and they focused in on free radical damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS). They found a vast amount of ROS proliferating—NOT all over the body in all of the major organ systems—but it was expressly happening in the gut of the fruit flies. So something strange is going on in the gut regarding free radical damage caused by a lack of sleep. Next, that same Harvard study did something elegant—They started dosing the flies with ~20 different antioxidants and they were able to keep the flies alive despite sleep depriving them if they treated the reactive oxygen species. The most interesting insight from that study—Melatonin is a remarkable antioxidant. They found melatonin to be one of the chemicals that seem to be beneficial in preventing these reactive oxygen species. Caveat: We don’t know if this is going to be replicated in animals, in mice or rats, and we certainly don’t know if this is true in humans. But if it did, then melatonin could be an interesting counter measure to help us protect human beings when we have obligatory sleep deprivation.",
