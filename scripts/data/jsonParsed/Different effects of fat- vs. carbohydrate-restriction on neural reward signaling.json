  "content": "The prevailing theories on obesity pathogenesis – the “carbohydrate-insulin model” and the “energy balance model,” both discussed in detail in my recent podcast interview with Dr. Stephan Guyenet – seem to agree that not all calories are created equal, but the question remains: how exactly are they different?",

  "title": "Reduced Fat vs Reduced Carbohydrate Diet",
  "date": "August 20, 2022",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The researchers sought to determine how a reduced fat (RF) diet versus a reduced carbohydrate (RC) diet impacted reward signaling in the brain. Though small, the study featured a robust randomized crossover design in which 17 volunteers with obesity were assigned to either an RF or RC diet to achieve 30% calorie restriction relative to a weight-maintaining baseline diet (tailored to the calorie needs of each individual based on resting energy expenditure measurements).",

  "title": "Effect of Dietary Fat on Neural Reward Circuitry",
  "date": "August 20, 2022",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "To their surprise, the investigators found that participants on RF diets – but not those on RC diets – exhibited reduced activity in response to food cues relative to baseline in the caudate nucleus and putamen, two areas of the brain known for their involvement in reward processing. Further, the RF diet decreased dopamine receptor binding potential, whereas the RC diet did not. The critical implication here is that dietary fat may have a greater effect on neural reward circuitry than dietary carbohydrate, which might explain why low-fat diets are often difficult to maintain.",

  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Hall and colleagues also investigated the effects of each diet on food intake and food choices among participants. After each calorie-restricted phase of the study, volunteers remained at the facility for an additional 3 days with ad-libitum access to a vending machine containing foods and beverages ranging in fat and carbohydrate content. During this time participants received all food from these vending machines, which contained breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack items. The authors reported that participants typically consumed more high-carb/high-fat foods as well as more sugar-sweetened beverages following the RF diet than following the RC diet. However, it’s critical to note that total calorie consumption during this ad-libitum phase was equivalent following RF and RC diets.",

  "title": "Different effects of fats and carbohydrates on neural signaling",
  "date": "August 20, 2022",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The study provides evidence that calories from carbohydrates and calories from fats are not identical in their effects on neural reward signaling. Fats and carbohydrates are metabolized on different timescales, and their respective downstream effects on neural signaling are thus also likely to occur on different timescales. It’s possible that a 2-3 hour timeline was simply better suited to detect alterations in signaling from fats instead of carbohydrates because it aligns better with the natural timescale of fats’ effects on dopamine. If carbohydrates have minimal effects at 2-3 hours postprandially, it’s unlikely that reducing carbohydrate intake will result in any detectable change in those effects at that time point.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The bottom line is that a calorie from one source is not always the same as a calorie from another source. Altering the study duration or neuroimaging timelines could lead to different observations. Further, follow-up studies would be necessary in order to elucidate the relationship between reward signaling and food choices, as this study establishes an interesting correlation but was not designed to test causation.",
