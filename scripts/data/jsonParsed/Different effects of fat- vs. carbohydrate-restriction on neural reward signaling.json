  "content": "“A calorie is a calorie” seems like a simple and obvious statement. But to obesity experts, this phrase is loaded with implications that have been hotly debated for decades. Do different macronutrients vary in their ability to drive obesity? The most prevailing theories on obesity pathogenesis – the “carbohydrate-insulin model” and the “energy balance model,” seem to agree that not all calories are created equal, but the question remains: how exactly are they different?",

  "title": "Study on Reduced Fat and Reduced Carbohydrate Diets",
  "date": "August 20, 2022",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The researchers sought to determine how a reduced fat (RF) diet versus a reduced carbohydrate (RC) diet impacted reward signaling in the brain. The 6-day calorie restriction protocol involved only reduction of either fat or carbs – the other two macronutrients remained unchanged relative to baseline. Neural reward responses were measured by fMRI and PET scans in response to visual food cues during baseline and on Day 5 of RF or RC diets.",

  "title": "Findings on Reduced Fat and Reduced Carbohydrate Diets",
  "date": "August 20, 2022",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The investigators found that participants on RF diets exhibited reduced activity in response to food cues relative to baseline in the caudate nucleus and putamen, two areas of the brain known for their involvement in reward processing. Further, the RF diet decreased dopamine receptor binding potential, whereas the RC diet did not. The critical implication here is that dietary fat may have a greater effect on neural reward circuitry than dietary carbohydrate, which might explain why low-fat diets are often difficult to maintain.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Hall and colleagues also investigated the effects of each diet on food intake and food choices among participants. The authors reported that participants typically consumed more high-carb/high-fat foods as well as more sugar-sweetened beverages following the RF diet than following the RC diet. However, total calorie consumption during this ad-libitum phase was equivalent following RF and RC diets. Though RF appeared to have a greater effect on food choices, it did not alter overall calorie intake relative to RC, making it difficult to ascertain what these results mean for the development of obesity.",

  "date": "August 20, 2022",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "This study was short, as the rigor of an in-patient testing environment prohibits extensive study durations. A longer study conceivably might have revealed a gradual divergence between diets in their subsequent effects on overall calorie intake for instance, or it might have shown a shift or reversal in effects on reward signaling as a result of long-term circuit adaptations. Notably, the authors do not appear to have measured how body weight or other metabolic parameters may have changed over the course of the interventions.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Fats and carbohydrates are metabolized on different timescales, and their respective downstream effects on neural signaling are thus also likely to occur on different timescales. The fMRI and PET scans in this study were conducted 2-3 hours after a meal, a wide range over which one’s metabolic state could change considerably.",

  "title": "Conclusion",
  "date": "August 20, 2022",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Above all, they provide robust evidence that calories from carbohydrates and calories from fats are not identical in their effects on neural reward signaling. However, it would be premature to review these results and conclude that fats exert effects on reward circuits and carbs don’t – or even to conclude that fats exert a greater effect. Altering the study duration or neuroimaging timelines could lead to different observations. Further, follow-up studies would be necessary in order to elucidate the relationship between reward signaling and food choices, as this study establishes an interesting correlation but was not designed to test causation. So all in all, this study shows that, when it comes to neural reward signaling, a calorie is not a calorie. But what exactly that means is still very much up for debate.",
