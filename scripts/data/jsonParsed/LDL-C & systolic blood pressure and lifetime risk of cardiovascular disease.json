  "content": "For those interested in human longevity, the prevention of cardiovascular disease has long been at the forefront. Looking at 5-year age groups, from the ages of 40-44 to 70-74, death rates for vascular disease (i.e., heart disease and cerebrovascular disease) is the second-leading killer (or a close first) in the United States, behind cancer deaths. By the time we reach 75-79 and beyond, death from vascular disease begins to take over in a big way. The rates of death rise monotonically to the point where a form of vascular disease is about 10 times more likely to show up on a death certificate of someone 95 years of age or older. Vascular disease is the final common path to death.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "For more than 20 years, Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies have been used to evaluate whether observational data might be related to disease causation. MR is based on the assumption that a genetic variant influences only the variable of interest, and since genetic variants are randomly allocated at birth, MR is less susceptible to confounding and reverse causation compared with observational epidemiologic studies. MR is considered to be a natural randomized control trial because genotypes are passed down randomly from parents to their offspring.",

  "date": "November 10, 2019",
  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Recently, a group of investigators used MR to study the association of genetic variants related to a lifetime of lower cholesterol in low-density lipoproteins (LDL-C) and lower systolic blood pressure (SBP; the number on top of the blood pressure ratio, corresponding to the pressure in the arteries during contraction of the ventricles of the heart) with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Genetic variants are also known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced as snips), which can be discerned by genotyping (e.g., 23andMe) and gene sequencing.",

  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Participants with genetic LDL-C scores higher than the median (ergo, lower LDL-C) had an odds ratio (OR) for major coronary events of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72-0.76; p < .001) compared with participants with genetic LDL-C scores at or below the median, which means a 26% relative risk reduction. The investigators noted that this scaled to an OR of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.43-0.48) per 38.7 mg/dL (or 1 mmol/L) lower LDL-C values. In English, for every 38.7 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C, the risk of major CV events was reduced by 54%. Participants with genetic SBP scores higher than the median (ergo, lower SBP) had an OR for major coronary events of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81-0.86; p < .001) compared with participants with genetic SBP scores at or below the median, which translates to 17% relative risk reduction. This scaled to an OR of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.52-0.59) per 10 mmHg lower SBP. Again, in English, for every 10 mmHg reduction in SBP, the risk of major CV events was reduced by 45%.",

  "title": "Implications of the Study",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "This Mendelian randomization demonstrates that a reduction of SBP by 5 mmHg and a reduction of LDL-C by 22.4 mg/dL, over the course of one’s lifetime, reduces risk of major adverse cardiac and vascular events by 53%. [And if you play with eTable 4, you can see all other permutations of this—I’m just pointing out the largest one.] Because of the frequency of this disease, a relative reduction of this much is also an enormous absolute risk reduction. It seems at least plausible that these results can be extrapolated further, which the authors suggest, to a reduction of SBP by 10 mmHg and a reduction of LDL-C by 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL). These yield a risk reduction of 45% and 54%, respectively, and note that these are independent, meaning in each case the other variable is not also being reduced.",

  "content": "Mendelian randomization can provide powerful evidence on mechanisms of disease and trying to determine the potential effects of modifiable exposures and health outcomes, but MR is not immune from limitations. One of the major threats to MR establishing causation is pleiotropy, which is the potential for SNPs to have more than one specific phenotypic effect. What if the same SNP that is associated with lower LDL-C levels also has an effect on some other aspect of CV risk? For example, say it somehow improves endothelial function. We may be fooled into thinking that the SNP confers CV protection because it lowers LDL-C, but it may be protective for some other reason, or its effects on LDL-C may be only telling part of the story.",

  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "If you look at the 100 SNPs used in the genetic LDL-C score, the SNP that had the largest effect size in terms of lower LDL-C levels—a reported -15 mg/dL—happens to be the T allele on rs7412. This SNP happens to be part of the APOE genoset evaluation that many people use to find out what alleles they have to determine risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Having one T allele on rs7412 effectively means you have a “2” in terms of APOE status. Having two copies means you’re an APOE 2/2, which is associated with a reduced risk for AD. So, if we were looking at AD risk and LDL-C levels in a Mendelian randomization study, it’s possible we might conclude that reduced risk of AD from this SNP is entirely due to its effect on LDL-C levels, when there are a number of other plausible mechanisms.",
