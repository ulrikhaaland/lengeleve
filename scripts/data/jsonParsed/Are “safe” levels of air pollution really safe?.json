  "content": "Over the last several decades, air quality studies have convincingly demonstrated that air pollutants are associated with numerous morbidities and early mortality. Extensive evidence shows that long-term exposure to airborne fine particles is strongly associated with negative effects on the respiratory system (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, and lung cancer), the central nervous system (oxidative stress and neuroinflammation leading to stroke, dementia, and neurodevelopmental disorders), and development (preterm delivery, low birth weight, and birth defects).",

  "content": "In the U.S., according to the EPA’s Air Quality Trends report surveying 206 cities across the nation, the average mean PM2.5 was 13.06 µg/m3 in 2000, 9.87 µg/m3 in 2010, and 7.96 µg/m3 in 2020 – a reduction of PM2.5 air pollutants by approximately 20-25% every decade. It’s clear that PM2.5 concentrations are now at their lowest national averages in recent records – even in dense metropolitan areas like New York City and Los Angeles, levels are well below the safe limit recommended by the EPA.",

  "content": "Trying to understand the effect of low air pollution on human health is a challenge. While it might be possible to determine the acute effects of high levels of pollutants by using short exposures in controlled test environments, assessing the health effects of long-term exposure at low concentrations does not afford such opportunities for controlled study environments. By necessity, study cohorts would need to be constantly exposed to very distinct environments in order to breathe distinct air, thus opening the door for a host of systemic differences in culture, diet, occupation, age, and climate, to name only a select few.",

  "content": "A recently published epidemiological cohort study provided data collected from seven European countries between 2000-2017 as part of the “Effects of Low-Level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe” (ELAPSE) project. This enormous dataset included over 28 million subjects ages 30+, and investigators analyzed these data to assess the relationship between long-term exposure of low level pollution and deaths from cardiovascular disease, non-malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, and overall non-accidental causes.",

  "content": "What can be done to reduce our own exposure to particulate air pollution? Taking cars off the road or banning burning of fossil fuels aren’t practical solutions, at least in the foreseeable future. While we might have limited power to impact our outdoor air environment, countermeasures can be taken within the home to reduce our individual exposure. Limiting smoke production from wood-burning fireplaces and other sources is one strategy for reducing pollution originating from within the home. Another strategy – which also reduces pollution that enters the home from outdoors – is to use a HEPA filter in everyday life.",

Using this information, we can modify our behavior in order to minimize exposure to (and damage from) PM2.5.",

  "content": "The large body of literature with consistent findings indicate there may be significant benefits to lowering the total amount of air pollutant exposure one receives over a lifetime. The EPA is currently proposing to revise the annual standard to below the 12 µg/m3 limit based on scientific evidence gathered during their 2020 policy assessments. The World Health Organization (WHO) has already lowered its own recommendations for safe PM2.5 limits from 10 µg/m3 in 2005 to 5 µg/m3 in its 2021 guidelines. Even in “green cities” where PM2.5 exposure is comfortably below the current U.S. EPA limit, efforts to further reduce exposure are likely to be beneficial for long-term health, and HEPA filters are a relatively affordable option for doing so.",
