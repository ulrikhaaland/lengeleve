  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "46-year-old male patient with normal BMI was diagnosed with essential hypertension, with blood pressure ranging from 140/90 to 160/90 mmHg. He was treated with lisinopril (ACEi) bringing him into the 130/90 range. His medication includes Uloric 40 mg QD, Lipitor 20 mg, and Repatha added in 6/2020. His medical history includes essential hypertension, mixed hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerotic heart disease with evidence of calcification on CAC. His nutrition is low carb with no signs of metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance. He exercises regularly with weight training 3x/week and Zone2 training 3 hr a week. His initial labs showed uric acid was 6.1, which was stubborn and never went down with dietary changes. After ~18 months on Uloric, his uric acid was 'fixed', his hypertension resolved even with a persistently high homocysteine, and he no longer required ACE inhibitor for blood pressure.",

  "content": "Things that can drive up uric acid levels include consumption of foods with lots of DNA and RNA (i.e., protein sources), yeast in beer, fructose, and genetics. Despite eating and exercising well, some individuals can't get their uric acid below 5.5 without using allopurinol. It is important to manage uric acid levels and try to fix the insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome before introducing drugs to treat blood pressure.",
