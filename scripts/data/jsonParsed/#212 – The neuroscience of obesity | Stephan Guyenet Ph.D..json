The input of fuels into the system leads to an increase in circulating metabolic factors that is now driving energy balance into the fat cell. The conventional model contends that fat tissue is simply a result of how many calories you happen to eat or how much you decide exercise. However the energy balance model acknowledges the brain regulation of both body fat and appetite. It contends that body fatness regulated by the energy intake and expenditure via the brain.",

If you understand the mechanism of obesity, then it should be easier to address. Most obesity drugs (weight loss drugs) were discovered in haphazard ways.
