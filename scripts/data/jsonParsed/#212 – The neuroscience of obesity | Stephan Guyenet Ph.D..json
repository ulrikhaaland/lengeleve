  "content": "There were insurance life tables in the early 1900 that suggested that people who had obesity had shortened lifespans and greater risk of certain diseases. This became controversial with a series of studies about the “obesity paradox” that Katherine Flegal was involved in. In these studies, looking at a graph of the relationship between BMI and longevity, the nadir (the lowest point on the graph) was in the overweight range. This finding was repeated in meta-analyses of millions and millions of people. This had people suddenly saying, “Well, maybe higher body fatness is not bad. Maybe it’s actually protective.” The reason this is called a paradox is because there is lots of evidence that excess body fat contributes to all kinds of diseases: type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers. How could obesity be productive for mortality when it’s driving all these diseases that are the leading causes of mortality? This is why it’s called the “obesity paradox”. Research has come out since then suggesting this is an artifact of the observational data. There are probably a few things going on. The biggest one is, people who are sick often lose weight. There are lots of health conditions that cause people to lose weight: poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Alzheimer’s disease, cognitive decline.

Peter’s recent surgery is an illustrative example. He had shoulder surgery less than 3 weeks ago. In the 18 days since his surgery, he’s lost 9 lbs. His BMI probably went from 26 to 24. On paper, this looks good, but he would argue there is nothing superior about his health today compared to 18 days ago. Of the 9 lbs he’s lost, probably 7 lbs were lean body mass.

Instead of correlating your current BMI with mortality risk, it asks the question “What’s the heaviest you’ve ever been, and how does that correlate with your health outcomes?” This aims to screen-out an health conditions you may have developed that might have caused you to lose weight. With this method, it sharpens the association between BMI and mortality. The nadar (lowest point on the graph of lowest longevity) now shifts to a lower BMI. Now a BMI in the lean range looks best. Further, there is a larger difference between being the mortality of people who are lean and those who are obese. This analysis excludes a bunch of people who were formerly in the obese category; it puts them in a lower category. Their health outcomes are terrible. Those who used to be classified as obese are now just overweight or lean. But they have massively elevated rates of chronic disease and mortality. They are bringing all this excess mortality into the lower weight categories.",

Stephan points out, “Probably a lot of people listening will have seen graphs of NHANES data where it kind of spikes around 1980.” The 1980 data was actually a multiyear survey that spanned somewhere around ‘76-‘84. 1978 was about the average of that data. Today the range is much narrower. So we don’t know exactly when obesity rates began to go up, but it is somewhere in the range of ‘76-‘84. During this time period (‘76-‘84) big changes happen to the diet. Somewhere from the late 70s – early 80s obesity went from around 15% to 43% of US adults. This includes people where 20 years old. So if you look at the lifetime risk, it’s well over 50%. “More than half of US adults will be classified as actually having obesity at some point in their life if the current context is maintained”‒ Stephan Guyenet. The same is true for type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of all diabetes is around 10-12%.

This is needed to get statistically significant results. You’re looking at millions of people. There are also a lot of genomic markers, so tremendous statistical power is needed to detect anything with a high level of confidence. The latest of these studies is on the order of 800,000 people. An example of studies that have saturated heritability are GWAS studies of height; they looked at around 3 million people. These studies have gotten all the information they can about common genetic variants that correlate with differences in height. Stephan thinks studies of BMI will be saturated in the near future. Soon we may know all the common genetic differences that correlate with differences in BMI. So far, GWAS have identified 900 venetic variants. This suggests that differences in BMI between individuals are genetically very complex. BMI is determined by a lot of different genes with very small effect sizes. So you’re getting this sorting of all these different genes and whatever combination you get determines whether you are susceptible or not to obesity in a fattening environment.",

Stephan adds the intuitive question, “Why can some people effortlessly stay thin and other people have to really struggle to maintain their weight and maybe are not able to”. Looking at genomic differences, one can identify genes and the tissues where they are expressed. There was a paper that looked at 48 different traits of all kinds of diseases, personality traits, other stuff; they asked “What does the tissue enrichment look like?” If you look at body mass index, it looks like psychiatric diseases and educational attainment. All of those are heavily enriched for brain-related genes to a similar degree. The biology of BMI is heavily enriched for brain-related biology. Peter adds that psychiatric diseases are some of the most heritable in medicine; schizophrenia has a heritability index of 0.6-0.7 (or more).

  "content": "A review of the “Carnivore diet” [1:21:45]. People lose weight on a carnivore diet, is this the motivation for going on this diet?  Why does it result in weight loss? Stephan reviewed a book on this diet, The Carnivore Code. We don’t have any good data on the impact of carnivore diet on weight; there are no randomized control trials. Anecdotally, people lose a lot of weight. Stephan speculates that a carnivore diet has multiple properties that make it an effective weight-loss diet. 1 – It has very little carbohydrates. Being on the extreme of the fat:carbohydrate ratio in either direction is more slimming than being in the middle. 2 – The variety of a carnivore diet is very low. You can prepare meat in different ways. You can eat chicken, fish, beef, whatever but the variety is greatly, greatly reduced. 3 –  You’re cutting out all the highly-processed, calorie-dense foods. Everyone agrees these foods drive excess intake and increased body fatness, though we could debate why.",

  "content": "Peter notes that a carnivore diet may have a role in overcoming some acute illness. One of the core tenets is that plants are low-grade toxic. Peter is biased toward thinking that plants are valuable. What is the thesis of a carnivore diet? Everything is toxic except grass-fed animal foods. Even tap water is considered not optimal. The book spends a lot of time going through the litany of all the potentially harmful compounds in plant foods. “There is a bias toward thinking if it’s in a plant, it’s healthy; and I don’t think that’s true.”‒ Stephan Guyenet. There are some plant compounds that are not good for some people. If you eat a lot of spinach, you can get kidney stones from all the oxalate. There are studies suggesting that the glucosinolates in cabbage family plants might contribute to type 2 diabetes. Kidney beans, if you don’t cook them enough, they can be really toxic because of the lectins.",

And most importantly, what are the empirical outcomes that we can see when its impacts on health are directly studied?” Stephan evaluates new ideas people come out with, about a healthy diet. Take lectins for example, Gundry suggests we shouldn’t eat certain plants because they contain lectins. This is a bottom-up approach, extrapolating empirical effects on health from mechanism. Stephan thinks its better in a complex field like nutrition to start with the empirical evidence. You first need a study to suggest that there’s an actual effect on health. Then you can try to understand the mechanism.",

This is better than the typical effect of diet and lifestyle strategies but you have to keep taking the drug. See an obesity specialist. For people who just want to lose a few pounds, try to give the nonconscious brain signals to regulate things in a more slimming direction. Here are some ways to control these signals to your brain: 1 – Control your food environment and the sensory cues your brain is exposed to. 2 – There’s a wide variation in the number of calories it takes to feel satisfied at a meal and this depends on what foods you are eating. It’s intuitive to eat until you feel satisfied and then stop eating. The satiety point can be reached with vastly different numbers of calories.",
