If you could layer liquid biopsy on top of diffusion weighted imaging MRI, the best colonoscopy, the best mammography, etc…you can theoretically construct a point where you can catch every cancer prior to its clinical presentation. The technology to start to see shed DNA from tumors (before they reach one centimeter) in blood biopsies is in sight, says Keith.",

But, given the lack of good evidence, Peter isn’t so sure the stem cells are that effective. And Peter is a little worried about the risk that the stem cells could acquire a life of their own (and presumably turn cancerous). Keith explains that a truly wild type stem cell will find its home, find its niche, and its proper influences, and behave accordingly. Unless it were to become a non-wild type through external manipulation outside the body or when it’s potentially fragile and capable of picking up aberrations that aren’t corrected. But stem cells are notably hardy cells that can survive insults remarkably well and correct them.",
