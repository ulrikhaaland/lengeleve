  "content": "Alcohol inhibits vasopressin, so it’s a potent diuretic, which means you’ll need to get up to urinate more frequently. It also negatively impacts: resting heart rate, heart rate variability, temperature and respiratory rate. Frequent wake ups (fragmented sleep) is a common side effect of alcohol consumption. Fragmented sleep is a predisposing factor for greater likelihood of amyloid and tau pathology, which are the two proteins that seem to contribute right now to Alzheimer’s.",
