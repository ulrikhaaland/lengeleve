With a bare metal stent, the body will re-endothelialize the inside of the stent within three weeks or four weeks but now that is prevented from happening. Before drug-eluting stents, the standard of care was to take Plavix for one month and you’re done. Today’s standard of care is that Plavix is taken for 6 months.

  "content": "Keyto is a company that created a portable breath analyzer for acetone. This sensor is ultimately all about solving the question: How do we use technology to help people change their behavior? The one unique fact about the keto diet that’s different from all the other diets is it allows you to follow a biomarker which acts as a guide to help your own adherence and help reinforce some of these behaviors. A good sensor (like Keyto) that people could carry around with them, and be accurate enough, could actually help guide behavioral changes.",
