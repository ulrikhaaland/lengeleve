We have focused on this 70% number because it’s what we can measure clinically… but there’s nothing to suggest that there’s a magic in that number that would put somebody at a greater risk, as opposed to somebody who had 50% The work of Michael Davies, much of the fatal plaque rupture events happened in arteries that had only 30 or 40% The paradox of stable angina People can have 90% inclusions and be highly symptomatic, but just incredibly stable The more the stenosis increases, the more likely it tells you that the downstream musculature has found some other way to acquire oxygen So someone who’s walking around the 95% stenosis is very likely to suffer death in the case of that plaque rupturing But the fact that it hasn’t ruptured yet makes it seem unlikely it will rupture in the future",
