Yajnik proposed the Soldier to Diplomat Hypothesis in which insulin resistance is an evolutionary adaptation that allows humans to preserve more glucose for brain function. Gerald (Jerry) Reaven who coined the term “metabolic syndrome” agreed that there is likely an evolutionary reason to preserve glucose for brain function. Dr. Yajnik’s research supports that hyperinsulinemia in utero may have some adaptive function to facilitate brain function and cognition (has positive trophic impact).",

A zone 2 fitness test uses lactate as a proxy to clamp lactate in order to assess maximum ATP production. Samples lactate after long stage time interval (10-15 minute) on fixed power setting on a treadmill or bike. Produces a lactate performance curve. Lactate threshold is in the 3.8 to 4.2 millimolar range and the performance curve remains below this range (below aerobic threshold).",

  "content": "In his insulin resistant Asian patients with lean body morphologies, Ronesh emphasizes balancing physical activity that builds aerobic endurance without compromising muscle mass. Exclusive or predominant weight training facilitates increased glycogen storage capacity but patients became cardiovascularly deconditioned without doing other kinds of exercise. He observed that cardiovascular deconditioning had impact on further improvements in insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. Ronesh observes lean Asian patients more readily lose muscle mass than other ethnic groups when doing volume endurance training. As an explanation, studies in athletes reveal AMPK inhibition of mTOR but Ronesh hypothesizes that the threshold for mTOR inhibition may be lower in an Asian patient population.",
