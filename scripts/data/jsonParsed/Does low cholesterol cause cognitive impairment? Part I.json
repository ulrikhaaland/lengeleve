  "content": "There’s a widely held notion that what is good for the heart is good for the brain. But when it comes to cholesterol levels, there’s some concern that lower may not be better in the case of the brain. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is primarily driven by three things: lipoproteins, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. There are several drugs that can reduce the amount of cholesterol and the lipoproteins that escort them through the body. Statins and PCSK9 inhibitors are known to reduce LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). But do the CVD benefits of lipid-lowering drugs come at a cost of increased risk of cognitive impairment? Cholesterol is a major constituent of the human brain and is the body’s most cholesterol-rich organ, containing about 20% of the body’s total cholesterol. Cholesterol is essential for normal brain development and is critically important for brain function.",

  "content": "A recent randomized controlled trial found, after nearly two years of treatment, there was no effect on cognitive function in those taking a PCSK9 inhibitor called alirocumab compared to placebo. The body has four distinct “pools” of cholesterol, in which tissues have regulatory mechanisms to maintain their respective homeostasis. The brain synthesizes its own cholesterol and does not exchange cholesterol with the other aforementioned pools, which means that cholesterol concentrations outside the brain have no direct impact on brain cholesterol. The brain’s cholesterol pool is a closed, self-sufficient system since it cannot exchange and excrete cholesterol, unlike other cholesterol pools in the periphery. There is no relation between plasma cholesterol measurements and tissue pools of cholesterol. Several other studies have demonstrated that PCSK9 inhibitors induced dramatic reductions in plasma LDL-C concentrations to as low as 10 mg/dL without adverse cognitive effects.",

  "content": "Newborns to young children have very low total plasma cholesterol compared to adults. Developing infants have quite low plasma cholesterol (between 100 and 130 mg/dL) and yet have the highest demand for cellular cholesterol, as they are in a period of rapid brain development. If plasma cholesterol were an accurate proxy for the cholesterol needed for our tissues and organs, we’d all be dead.",

  "content": "It still does not fully satisfy my need to know if aggressive statin use, at least in some people, might be associated with poor cognitive outcomes. Much of the data we have discussed are based on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors, which are the most potent lipid-lowering medications available. But their mechanism of action increases lipoprotein clearance from the circulation via the liver by directly inhibiting a protein that degrades LDL receptors (LDLR). Conversely, statins work primarily by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, which has the knock-on effect of increasing liver expression of LDLR and clearance of LDL. So, while the manner in which these two drugs work is similar (LDLR-mediated), the mechanisms by which the two affect LDLR are different. Is it at least possible that statins, specifically, may alter brain cholesterol synthesis?",
