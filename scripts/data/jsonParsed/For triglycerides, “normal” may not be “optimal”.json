  "content": "The 2020 study investigated the relationship between serum triglycerides (TG) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Triglycerides are composed of three fatty acid molecules bound to a glycerol backbone. The study found that the positive correlation between CVD risk and average TG levels begins at TG levels around 50 mg/dL. Above this level, risk continues to rise with increasing TGs, with each doubling of serum TGs corresponding to a CVD risk increase of 65%. The relationship starts to weaken around 150 mg/dL before almost completely leveling off above 200 mg/dL, indicating that increases in TGs above 200 mg/dL confer no additional CV risk.",

  "date": "May 14, 2022",
  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "These results suggest that the risk associated with TG levels may be due to elevations apoB–containing lipoproteins (remnants and LDLs). This is consistent with genetic studies which have shown that the risk associated with elevated TGs can be accounted for through their association with elevations in apoB, in which case, measurement of apoB itself would provide the most accurate information about CVD risk.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Interestingly, the relationship between TG and CVD risk varied significantly between men and women, with a stronger association for women vs. men (HR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.50–2.14 vs HR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.15–1.55). These remarkable differences strongly signal a need for gender-specific guidelines for what constitutes “optimal” TG levels.",

Although these data further indicate that truly “optimal” TG levels may be even lower than 100 mg/dL and may differ significantly between men and women.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The critical point is now to recognize that lipoprotein-related CV risk is more accurately reflected by the number of apoB-containing lipoproteins rather than their TG content. The knowledge that apoB may be a more direct metric of CV risk than TGs should prompt the medical community to rethink conventional interpretations of TG levels when apoB information is not available.",
