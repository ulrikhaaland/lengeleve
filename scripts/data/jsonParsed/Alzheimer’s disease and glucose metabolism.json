  "content": "Accumulating research suggests glucose hypometabolism in the brain is not just a marker of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), but a maker of it. Observational studies suggest patients with diabetes (particularly type 2, T2DM) have an elevated risk of developing AD and other forms of dementia. Different variants of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) allele affect glucose metabolism in the brain in mice. Mice with two copies of the APOE2 variant are more efficient at utilizing glucose than APOE4 mice, which could help explain the associated protection of the APOE2 variant, and elevated risk of APOE4 seen in study after study in the US population.",

  "content": "There is a focus on testing diabetes drugs among patients with AD and other forms of cognitive impairment. Studies are also looking at whether diet and exercise might delay cognitive impairment. Effective treatments for diabetes may also help treat AD. If T2DM increases the risk for AD, lowering the risk of T2DM may lower the risk of AD as well.",

  "content": "A study looking at positron emission tomography (PET) scans of people at high risk for developing AD have detected decreases in the rate of glucose metabolism in the brain decades before the appearance of AD symptoms. If abnormalities can be detected early, they can be addressed early.",
