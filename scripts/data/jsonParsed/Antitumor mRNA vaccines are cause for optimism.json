  "content": "Moderna recently announced the efficacy of a personalized mRNA vaccine in combination with traditional immunotherapy in treating patients with stage III/IV melanoma. The ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial KEYNOTE-942, sponsored by Moderna in collaboration with Merck, revealed that the group receiving adjuvant mRNA vaccine treatment and Keytruda demonstrated a 44% reduction in risk of recurrence or death compared to the group receiving the PD-1 inhibitor drug alone. The preliminary announcement was picked up by several mainstream news outlets, followed shortly by heated debate and misinformation on social media.",

  "content": "Vaccines may enhance the immune response to cancer by priming the immune system to recognize cancerous cells. Though cancer vaccines are designed for treatment rather than prevention, they function in a manner analogous to that of vaccines against viral or bacterial pathogens – i.e., by introducing an antigen or set of antigens associated with the abnormal cells in order to train the immune system to recognize them and mount a targeted response.",

But since normal cells often express these proteins as well, this approach can result in toxic autoimmune responses against healthy tissue, demonstrating the need for tumor-specific antigens.",

  "content": "Unfortunately, the ways in which cancer cells differ from healthy cells vary from person to person and from tumor to tumor. For those of you who may recall my discussion with Dr. Rosenberg, one of the most amazing insights of the past few years is that while each person’s cancer may have on average about 100 mutations (give or take), at least 80% of cancer patients have mutations that are recognized by their own immune system. That’s the good news. The bad news is that virtually none of these immunogenic mutations are shared across people. Thus, creating vaccines for tumor-specific antigens is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor; it requires a tailored approach for each individual patient and tumor.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Of the many categories of vaccines, nucleic acid-based vaccines – i.e., those involving DNA or RNA as a template to code for antigens – offer distinct advantages when it comes to personalization and other challenges. RNA vaccines consist of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed in vitro from DNA encoding antigens of interest (e.g., proteins present specifically in pathogens or cancer cells). After entering a cell, the mRNA is used as a template for creating the antigen proteins, which are subsequently presented on the surface of certain immune cells to stimulate a targeted, highly-specific immune response to tumor cells bearing those antigens. mRNA vaccines offer several practical advantages over other vaccine types, including lower production costs and enhanced safety, but particularly with respect to cancer, we have reason to expect that they may also be more effective.",

  "title": "Combining mRNA Vaccines with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors",
  "date": "January 7, 2023",
  "context": "Cancer",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "As you may recall from my previous newsletter on immunotherapy, the difficulty of recognizing abnormal cells is not the only challenge the immune system faces when it comes to battling cancer. Tumor cells can also actively suppress immune reactions, in part by activating “immune checkpoints.” These checkpoints normally serve to block immune activity against healthy tissue but can be hijacked by cancer cells in order to evade destruction. So we now have two problems: how to make “custom” treatments for each patient, which mRNA vaccine technology can do, and how to rev up the immune system to attack the cancer, now that it recognizes it. In other words, although creating personalized vaccines against specific tumor antigens may help the immune system to identify abnormal cells, doing so does not guarantee that the body will then mount a full immune response to destroy those cells. This is where Keytruda enters the story. Keytruda is part of a class of drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors and acts by suppressing the activity of the checkpoint protein PD-1. The drug has rightfully been celebrated in its own right since receiving FDA approval in 2014, with melanoma patients on Keytruda showing significantly higher recurrence-free survival than those on placebo (HR: 0.57; 98.4% CI: 0.43 – 0.74; P<0.001). But according to Moderna’s recent announcement, Keytruda in combination with mRNA-4157/V940 reduces risk by an additional 44% relative to Keytruda alone. While it’s worth reiterating that these data are very preliminary, they do make sense. An mRNA vaccine stimulates a highly-specific immune response against a given tumor, and a PD-1 inhibitor removes a barrier which would otherwise prevent that response from proceeding. One treatment presses the gas, the other lifts up on the brakes. A logical and potentially very potent combination.",
