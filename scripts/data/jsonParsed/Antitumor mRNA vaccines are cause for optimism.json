  "content": "Moderna’s recent announcement on the efficacy of a personalized mRNA vaccine – in combination with traditional immunotherapy – in treating patients with stage III/IV melanoma. The ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial KEYNOTE-942, sponsored by Moderna in collaboration with Merck. Patients with stage III or IV melanoma underwent surgical tumor removal, after which they began treatment in one of two randomly assigned study arms: the experimental group received the immunotherapeutic PD-1 inhibitor drug pembrolizumab (trade name Keytruda) plus the novel anti-cancer mRNA vaccine mRNA-4157/V940, while the comparison group received Keytruda alone. The groups were then followed for comparison of recurrence-free survival (RFS). The group receiving adjuvant mRNA vaccine treatment and Keytruda demonstrated a 44% reduction in risk of recurrence or death compared to the group receiving the PD-1 inhibitor drug alone.",

  "content": "Vaccines may enhance the immune response to cancer by priming the immune system to recognize cancerous cells. Though cancer vaccines are designed for treatment rather than prevention, they function in a manner analogous to that of vaccines against viral or bacterial pathogens – i.e., by introducing an antigen or set of antigens associated with the abnormal cells in order to train the immune system to recognize them and mount a targeted response.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Creating vaccines for tumor-specific antigens is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor; it requires a tailored approach for each individual patient and tumor. From a routine tumor biopsy, it’s possible to determine the DNA signatures specific to a given case of cancer. For mRNA-4157/V940, Moderna used these signatures to create personalized mRNA vaccines to target unique mutational hallmarks in the tumors of each individual patient, theoretically enhancing efficacy against that tumor while reducing the likelihood of off-target autoimmunity.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "mRNA vaccines offer several practical advantages over other vaccine types, including lower production costs and enhanced safety, but particularly with respect to cancer, we have reason to expect that they may also be more effective. A single mRNA strand can encode several antigens, and therefore, a single immunization can induce the immune system to recognize and target multiple cancer cell hallmarks, reducing the risk that variations among the abnormal cells might permit some to evade detection.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Tumor cells can also actively suppress immune reactions, in part by activating “immune checkpoints.” These checkpoints normally serve to block immune activity against healthy tissue but can be hijacked by cancer cells in order to evade destruction. Keytruda is part of a class of drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors and acts by suppressing the activity of the checkpoint protein PD-1. Keytruda in combination with mRNA-4157/V940 reduces risk by an additional 44% relative to Keytruda alone.",
