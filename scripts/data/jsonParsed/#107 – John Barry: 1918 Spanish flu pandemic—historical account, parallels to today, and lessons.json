  "content": "In the western world, the case mortality was about 2%. The mortality was higher in the less developed world mostly because the west had been exposed to the milder first wave which provided immunity to many. The 1918 virus, like coronavirus, but unlike most influenza viruses, could bind to cells in the upper respiratory tract which made it easily transmissible. Additionally, it could also bind directly to cells deep in the lung which meant you were starting out essentially with viral pneumonia. People are so turning dark blue from lack of oxygen. Nose bleeds were common. Could also bleed from mouth, eyes, and ear. Unlike most influenza viruses, the 1918 virus could pretty much attack any organ. It was killing people in their 20s and 30s. Which is very atypical of the flu which normally kills the elderly and immunocompromised. But the peak age was 28 … suggesting that the stronger your immune system, the worse off you were. COVID-19 patients are getting hit in the same way in terms of it being an Acute respiratory distress syndrome ⇒ the virus when it was in the lung, the immune system attacked it with everything it had. However… With the 1918 flu pandemic, the majority of people died of secondary bacterial pneumonia and much less from the virus itself. Some say only 5% of the people died directly because the virus. John says that is mistaken and he estimates about 30-40% died directly from the virus (and the other 60-70% died from secondary bacterial pneumonia).",

His books have also been embraced by experts in applicable fields: in 2006 he became the only non-scientist ever to give the National Academies Abel Wolman Distinguished Lecture, a lecture which honors contributions to water-related science, and he was the only non-scientist on a federal government Infectious Disease Board of Experts. He has served on numerous boards, including ones at M.I.T’s Center for Engineering Systems Fundamentals, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Society of American Historians. His books have involved him in two areas of public policy. In 2004, he began working with the National Academies and several federal government entities on influenza preparedness and response, and he was a member of the original team which developed plans for mitigating a pandemic by using “non-pharmaceutical interventions”– i.e., public health measures to take before a vaccine becomes available. Both the Bush and Obama administrations have sought his advice on influenza preparedness and response, and he continues his activity in this area.",
