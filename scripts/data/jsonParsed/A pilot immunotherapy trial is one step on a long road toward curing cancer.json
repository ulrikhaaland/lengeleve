  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Because checkpoint modulators won’t work against cancers that are mismatch repair-proficient. When cells can’t correct DNA replication mistakes, they accumulate more mutations with each cell division cycle. Thus, mismatch repair-deficient tumors develop an unusually high number of mutations, generally at least an order of magnitude greater than mismatch repair-proficient cancers (think 1000 mutations instead of 100).",

  "date": "June 18, 2022",
  "context": "Cancer",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "As stated above, the immune system can only recognize cancer cells as abnormal because those cells include mutations which differentiate them from normal cells, so tumors with a high mutation burden are recognized (and subsequently destroyed) more easily and efficiently than those with fewer mutations. As Dr. Rosenberg explained on the podcast (clip below), immune checkpoint modulators are thus most effective against highly mutated cancers, but they have little effect on cancers with lower, more typical numbers of mutations.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Looking ahead, one of the next hurdles for immunotherapy is how to make T cells better at recognizing cancers without a high mutation burden. One option is adoptive cell therapy, in which the select T cells which do respond to tumors are engineered or isolated from a donor. The cells are grown in a lab in large numbers, after which they’re introduced into the patient. Research on this strategy is in its early stages but has become a principal focus for Dr. Rosenberg and other investigators.",
