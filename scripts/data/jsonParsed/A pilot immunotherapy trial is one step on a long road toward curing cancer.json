  "content": "In a cohort of 12 participants with rectal cancer, a novel drug “completely obliterated a cancer in every patient.” No radiation. No chemotherapy. No surgery. The new medication, dostarlimab, is an example of a class of drugs called immune checkpoint modulators, which constitute one branch of the broader treatment approach known as immunotherapy. Immunotherapy for cancer treatment is founded on the concept that tumor cells have mutations which differentiate them from normal cells, making it possible for the body’s own immune system to recognize the cancer cells and destroy them. This approach offers a level of selectivity that isn’t possible with more traditional treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, and even surgery.",

  "date": "June 18, 2022",
  "context": "Cancer",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Though the immune system can indeed recognize many cancers, the subsequent immune response is, in the vast majority of cases, too weak to overcome tumor growth and spread. Cancer cells can also evade the immune system by producing particular molecules which suppress an immune response, for instance by inhibiting the action of effector T cells and promoting production of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. The goal of immunotherapy is thus to assist the immune system in overcoming these challenges and doing what it’s meant to do: eradicate abnormal cells.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Accomplishing this goal requires treatments of varying degrees of aggressiveness depending on the patient and on the tumor. In very rare instances, the immune system is capable of fighting advanced cancer all on its own, resulting in spontaneous regression without treatment. For others, simply jump-starting the immune system’s natural activity in sufficient: some of the earliest successes in immunotherapy came during the 1980s when melanoma patients were treated with high doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine which plays a key role in immune stimulation by promoting T cell growth and activation.",

  "context": "Cancer",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The NEJM results are certainly exciting – total elimination of cancer in any patient is worthy of celebration – but when we look more closely, we find that even with a 100% response rate, dostarlimab, like IL-2 therapy, is unlikely to be a universal cancer cure. Only 12 patients have thus far completed the full treatment regimen out of a starting cohort of 16, all of whom had locally-advanced (stage II or III) rectal adenocarcinoma. These cancers all shared the key characteristic of “mismatch repair deficiency,” meaning that they included mutations which impair a cell’s ability to correct mistakes in DNA during replication.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "One of the next hurdles for immunotherapy is how to make T cells better at recognizing cancers without a high mutation burden. One option is adoptive cell therapy, in which the select T cells which do respond to tumors are engineered or isolated from a donor. The cells are grown in a lab in large numbers, after which they’re introduced into the patient. Research on this strategy is in its early stages but has become a principal focus for investigators.",
