Possible benefits of batokines: Heart—cardioprotection via FGF21 and IL-6, Pancreas—preservation of beta cells, Liver—fatty acid oxidation, so presumably it might lower fatty liver, lower white adipose tissue, so you have more lipolysis and more glucose uptake, Inhibition of myostatin—potentially the increase in brown adipose tissue activity inhibits myostatin.",
