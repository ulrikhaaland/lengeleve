Performed over 10 weekly sessions, the study showed that “participants reported significant improvements in their quality of life after session six.”",

  "content": "There was no control group in this study. The study was not randomized. How can we possibly know if any effect, however small, was not more of a result of some other factor associated with being in a study, such as the attention of the investigators? Did you notice that the article stated that participants reported significant improvements in their self-reported QoL after session six, which was 6 weeks into a 10-week study? It turns out that after the 10-weekly sessions, the reported improvements in the QoL of participants were not statistically significant.",
