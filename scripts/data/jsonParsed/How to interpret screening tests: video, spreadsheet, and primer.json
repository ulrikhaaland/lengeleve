  "content": "For any test, there is usually a tradeoff between avoiding false positives and false negatives. The same is true in cancer screening. If an MRI can detect tumors < 1 mm in size, it’s highly sensitive. However, the test is going to be less specific. More false alarms. The opposite is true as well. If an MRI only detects tumors > 5 cm, the test will be highly specific (i.e., low false positives), but have low sensitivity (i.e., high false negatives). The higher the specificity, the lower the sensitivity.",

Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly do not have the disease. The NPV is virtually 100%. What it appears to be showing is that if you test negative, you almost assuredly don’t have thyroid cancer. While true, this is misleading. Only 0.16% of the population tested has thyroid cancer. Because 99.84% of the people tested don’t have thyroid cancer, the NPV can’t be less than 99.84%.",

The test would have 0% specificity. The converse is true as well. Imagine the letter sent to 500,000 was instead a negative letter. It would identify 100% of the true negatives and would yield zero false positives. The test would have 100% specificity. But it would also carry with it 0% sensitivity.",
