This approach is safer from a blood loss perspective but it is not as good at removing all the cancer. For blood loss, it's important to understand where the veins are and control them by suturing them before they start bleeding. For retaining potency, it's crucial to work with anatomists and listen to patients. About 4% of cases, on average, have urinary leakage, more common in women and older men. For a 50 year old man, over 90% will regain function after surgery. But erectile dysfunction is an age-related dysfunction, so the older the patient the higher the chance of not fully regaining function.",

PSA is used as a tool to screen for prostate cancer by checking the values of the PSA in the blood. The bigger the prostate, the more PSA leaks into the blood. The older the person, generally the more PSA in blood. An infection or cancer in the prostate can make the PSA rise. Age-adjusted PSA levels are used to determine normal levels. However, no PSA number, no matter how low, guarantees that you don’t have cancer. Higher than normal levels are cause for more workup.",

Risks involved with biopsies include bleeding after the procedure and a small percentage of patients getting an infection. Before deciding on a biopsy, it's recommended to get a PHI or 4K score and if abnormal, get an MRI. If there’s an abnormality on the MRI, a biopsy is recommended. You should do the suspicious lesion plus doing a sextant biopsy. If the MRI is a false negative, the PSA density is looked at more closely. If PSA density if high, a biopsy is recommended.",

In the beginning, you would get a Gleason sum: What’s the score of most prevalent abnormality on the view of the tumor (rated 1-5), What’s the score of the second most common, kind of glandular architecture (rated 1-5). You add those two scores together to get the Gleason sum. Now, it’s evolved to the Gleason grade group. There are some subtle differences in the Gleason sum that actually have real big differences for what the patient’s outcomes would be. In 2014/2015, a better way to transmit this Gleason information to patients and to internits in a way they can understand was created.",

Relationship between 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial showed that lowering DHT could reduce the risk of prostate cancer. But one of the problems was that there was increased detection of more aggressive cancers in men taking the drug to lower DHT.",
