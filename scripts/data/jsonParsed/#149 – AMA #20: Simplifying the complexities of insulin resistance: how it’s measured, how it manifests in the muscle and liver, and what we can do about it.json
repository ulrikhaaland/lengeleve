There are a couple of gold standard ways to measure and quantify insulin resistance that are done in clinical trials. The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique is a measure of tissue insulin sensitivity, and the more insulin sensitive you are, the higher that glucose disposal rate will be. The insulin suppression test is kind of the opposite of the euglycemic clamp, which is you fix the level of glucose and you’re trying to see how much insulin is required to do that. The best way to test for insulin resistance is the oral glucose tolerance test.",

In other words, exercise is boosting insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal. Two probable mechanisms by which exercise is boosting insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal: 1 – The insulin-dependent way. 2 – The insulin-independent way. Over time (i.e., chronically) more exercise reduces intramuscular lipid, increases oxidative phosphorylation, and therefore reduces TAG and DAG. The importance of exercise in this situation cannot be overstated. Combine exercise with regulating carbohydrate level to your tolerance, reducing fructose intake, etc. for even better results. This is great news because we now know metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, NASH, don’t need drugs to cure them.",
