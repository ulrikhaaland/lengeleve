  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There is a strong genetic component to Alzheimer’s disease. Several genes that are implicated in this, but the three most penetrant genes are: PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP. These genes are as close to what we would call deterministic as any genes are. Fortunately, they are very rare and only account for 1% of AD cases. So 99% of patients who go on to develop Alzheimer’s disease do not have one of the “deterministic genes”. Of those patients, about two thirds have at least one copy of the ApoE4 gene. To put that in context, about 25% of the general population has at least one copy of the ApoE4 gene (most of them are just one copy). Two copies of e4 is pretty rare—about 2% of the population. But that 25% of the population makes up two thirds of all cases of Alzheimer’s disease. So out of the gate, you realize, before you jump into the minutiae on this, clearly this gene is highly associated with Alzheimer’s disease. But this is not a deterministic gene. There are plenty of patients with ApoE4, one copy or even two, who never go on to develop dementia. There are even centenarians walking around with E4s, meaning there are people who make it to a 100 with no signs of dementia who are carrying E4s. There are other genes at play that can amplify risk and others that can attenuate risk. One variant of klotho, KLVS, attenuates risk in E4s. So an E3/4 carrier that has the klotho KLVS variant, their risk returns to that of a 3/3. A 4/4 carrier who has a klotho KLVS, their risk returns to almost a 3/3. Conversely, the wrong mitochondrial haplotype will amplify risk. TGF-beta would be another one that amplifies risk. TOMM40 would be another one that amplifies risk. Some of these genes and SNPs can be identified on regular, call it, commercial over-the-counter tests such as 23andMe. But truthfully, for most of Peter’s patients, they are doing whole genome sequencing on this particular topic because the error rate is lower and most of the genes that we care about are not genes that are showing up on the shorter SNP tests.",

The short answer is it’s really hard. There is still no turnkey solution for looking at the entire suite of genes that are involved in Alzheimer’s disease, even kind of the 12 most relevant. For now, Peter works with Richard Isaacson and his team and brute force it by literally going through the whole genome sequence trying to identify these. There’s a huge opportunity there to streamline this process, which again, wouldn’t be interesting if not for what we’re about to talk about today. In other words, I don’t know that this would matter a whole heck of a lot, unless you believed you could do something about it, which I think comes back to kind of a broader issue around ApoE4 testing.",

I think knowing something allows you to plan accordingly”. “But I don’t even believe that premise. I do believe there’s a lot that can be done to delay onset and/or reduce risk.”",

  "content": "Globally, the prevalence of AD is 2 to 1 in favor of women to men—so women are literally twice as likely to get Alzheimer’s disease as men. Interestingly, we see the reverse in Parkinson’s disease. Each figure is showing you men and women, so the women are in red, the men are in green. The first column is showing you the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, the 10-year risk. So for a given age, what is the subsequent decade’s risk? So in the first column, that’s for Alzheimer’s disease. In the second column, that’s for vascular dementia, which is the second most prevalent form of dementia. The final column is just 10-year risk of all dementias (So that would include Alzheimer’s plus vascular, plus Lewi body, frontal, etc.). If you go by rows, you’re just looking at the decade in which we look. The top row is people in their 60s. The next row is people in their 70s. The final row is people 80 and up. So not surprisingly, as you move down the rows, the numbers get bigger. And not surprisingly, the third column has to be greater than the sum of the first two columns, because it includes both of them plus other things. Lastly, each box shows the six genotypes, the six combinations. It always goes the same direction, E2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3 and 4/4, which is more or less in the order of risk. Although you’ll see that when it comes to Alzheimer’s disease, specifically, the 3/2 is the lowest risk. In all cause dementia, 2/2 is the lowest risk. That probably has to do with the impact of the E2 genotype in Lewy body and other dementias. But we’ll put that aside for a moment. Takeaways: What’s really obvious when looking at this is that the 4/4 has a significantly higher risk than everything else — and then the 3/4 and the 4/2 are kind of next.",

So if a patient is E4, you’re going to see that the data are divided between E4 and non-E4. So the E4 segment is just 2/4s and 3/4s, and that was about a third of the sample.

So in other words, the rate of decline of the E4s doing the healthy things seems to be identical to the non-E4s who are not engaging in the healthy behaviors. In other words, this suggests that you have some control over this. This is malleable. If you look at the left-hand graph in the dotted line, including that confidence interval, it’s basically identical to the solid line on the right. Another way to look at this is: healthy behaviors have a greater impact on E4s than non-E4s. The lift that you can get with healthy behaviors seems to be even greater as an E4, than as an E3.",

If you look at a mouse model of AD, overall plaque burden is reduced by a lot, 40% in mice who are on a diet that’s enriched with DHA compared to a placebo. However, if you look at the human data, it’s not quite as clear. Another six-month RCT in humans looked at AD patients treated with EPA and DHA. They didn’t look at cognitive outcomes, they looked at inflammatory markers like interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and a number of other markers of inflammation. They found that there was a reduction in those markers over six months. So is that relevant? — “I don’t know. Maybe there’s a benefit to using EPA and DHA as a means of reducing inflammation. This is pretty indirect.” Peter states that he, personally, still takes EPA and DHA as a supplement, but he doesn’t push this on every patient because there’s a small, but non-zero, risk of Afib that comes with high doses of EPA and DHA.",

You can make the case for patients who have inflammation or maybe even patients who are in the earliest stages of MCI. The first is an 18-month study. 40 subjects. Half of subjects randomized to 90 milligrams of Theracurmin twice a day and then an equal number assigned to a placebo. These people were deemed to have kind of normal aging or MCI but not have dementia. The outcome of this test was looking at amyloid PET scans. Over a relatively short period of time, which was 18 months, the amyloid PET scans showed that behavioral and cognitive benefits were associated with either a decrease in plaque entangle accumulation in the brain regions that modulated mood and memory—which was mostly the amygdala—or a suspension of further plaque entangle accumulation in the hypothalamus. That’s probably why we would give this our “least bad” assessment. This is one of the supplements Peter takes. Looking at a six-month retrospective study of patients treated who had AD. 19 of them had Alzheimer’s disease. 17 had mild cognitive impairment. 57 were controls. The two treatment groups were treated with 180 milligrams per day. They saw that the cognitive scores and activities of daily living scores decreased in the AD patients not treated with Theracurmin, whereas the scores were stable in those with Theracurmin. In other words, the patients with disease remained stable on the Theracurmin, but if they were not on the Theracurmin, they continued their decline. “Based on this, we say maybe there’s something to [Theracurmin]”.",

Homocysteine also inhibits something called asymmetric dimethyl arginine, and that plays a role in impairing nitric oxide synthase. So if you reduce nitric oxide synthase, you produce less nitric oxide, you have less vascular dilation. So Cocoa Flavonoids seem to increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide by increasing the activity of the sort of endothelium derived nitric oxide synthase.
