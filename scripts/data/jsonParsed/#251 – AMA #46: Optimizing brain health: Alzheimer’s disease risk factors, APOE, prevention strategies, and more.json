  "content": "Alzheimer’s disease is both the most common neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease starts with a clinical diagnosis made by a neurologist who assesses various symptoms such as difficulty remembering events, difficulty concentrating, planning or problem solving, confusion with location, temporal confusion, and language problems. There may be some sort of mental status exam or neuropsychological tests. There will also be some lab tests done to rule out other causes. The diagnosis isn't definitively made until an autopsy. However, there are other biomarkers that are increasing in the sensitivity for this, such as the ability to look at serum, amyloid, and tau.",

  "content": "Biomarkers like amyloid and tau are used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. These were typically drawn from cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) which can be accessed via a lumbar puncture. However, this is impractical in the real world. Now, other scores like the C2N developed amyloid score are used. This score uses a patient’s ApoE variant, looks at the ratio of two variants of amyloid beta, and also looks at their age to predict the probability of Alzheimer's disease pathology.",

  "content": "There are various strategies for preventing Alzheimer’s disease and neurodegeneration. Exercise is a potent tool, but there are also lesser-known factors that could impact brain health, such as nutrition supplementation, lipid management, brain games, sauna, oral health, and hearing loss. Modifiable behaviors that potentially play a role in risk reduction of neurodegeneration include smoking, alcohol, sleep, head injuries, and blood pressure. Nutrition also impacts brain health, with common diets, metabolic health, and energy balance playing a role. Supplements such as EPA and DHA, vitamin D, and B vitamins can also be beneficial.",

The risk of smoking to dementia is less than the risk of smoking to lung cancer and heart disease. However, we’re talking about a roughly 60% increase in the risk—so at any point in time, a smoker compared to a non-smoker is going to have about a 60% higher chance of all-cause dementia. Once you have quit for at least nine years, your risk falls to that of a non-smoker. There’s an alcohol paradox. Some people have claimed that there is a backwards J-shaped morbidity curve associated with alcohol. The lowest risk is at a couple drinks a week and then risk goes way up. But if you go down to no alcohol, risk goes up. It turns out that that’s almost entirely confounded by the population of people that are consuming zero alcohol.",

But it’s easier epidemiologically to study than things like exercise and things like nutrition because the intervention itself is so straightforward and it’s generally much easier for people to recall how long they sleep than what they ate, for example. When it comes to Alzheimer’s disease risk, we’re seeing about a 60% increase when it comes to all-cause dementia, we’re seeing about a 20% increase for people who have disturbed sleep versus not disturbed sleep. When we start to get into short sleep, comparing people with less than five hours of sleep to people with more than seven hours of sleep, you’re talking about a hazard ratio of 2.6, meaning 160% difference in all-cause dementia.",

There’s a fundamental problem here, which is not to suggest that nutrition isn’t important. The way we really want to go about answering this question is: we want to look at what the increase in risk is for patients who have type 2 diabetes. It’s very difficult to assume that that risk isn’t real, that it’s not causal. Then we want to ask the question: How big is that compared to the magnitude of the benefit from following any one of these “magical” diets? The implication of that is that not having diabetes, not being insulin-resistant and being in energy balance has more benefit than anything else. And therefore the right diet is whatever diet keeps you insulin-sensitive in energy balance, and obviously therefore, not having type 2 diabetes.",
