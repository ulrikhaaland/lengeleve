The heel is up in a way that’s probably generating a little bit more tension in the hamstring. And that hamstring tension allows him to feel something in his upper back. The feeling you want in your upper back when squatting is to feel like your pushing it back through your ribcage — “it’s a very subtle movement”.",

  "content": "The older you are, the more important it is to emphasize anything that’s going to allow you to maintain and build strength and maintain muscle mass. Peter is very reluctant to put an excess fasting routine in place for somebody that’s not very heavy. If you’re talking about somebody who’s got 35% body fat, insulin resistance, I think fasting’s a very effective tool and it’s okay that they’re going to probably lose a little bit of lean mass, because they’re probably going to lose more fat mass along the way. If you’re talking about somebody who’s kind of lanky, Peter would lean towards not fasting so much and if you’re going to fast do it intermittently — e.g., maybe once a quarter you do a short fast for three days. But most of the time should be really focused on building.",

  "content": "The problem with one meal a day for most people, if they’re trying to put on muscle mass, it’s pretty darn hard to eat two grams per kilo of protein in one sitting. OMADs and things like that are generally going to come at the expense of muscle mass—Not because muscle protein synthesis can’t take place if you’re smart about where you target and time your exercise, but because I simply think most people are protein deficient when they do it. Timing protein around workouts- does it really matter? The punchline answer is “no”. There is actually quite a big window for that so it’s not like you have to be cramming down protein the nanosecond you finish that workout. But you want to get it in at some point that day of a workout. Generally speaking, heavy time restricted feeding probably hurts muscle mass more because it simply limits the volume of protein you take in.",

By doing it twice a week, you’re getting a more steady state by using a lower dose twice a week. Injected sub-Q with about the smallest needle you can get the oily testosterone cypionate out of which is about a 25 gauge (usually in the butt). Note: Lotions and creams are an alternative esp. For patients uncomfortable with giving shots, however, he finds that there’s less compliance and variable absorption rates.
