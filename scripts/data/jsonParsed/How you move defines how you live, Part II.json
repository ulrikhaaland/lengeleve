  "content": "In the summer of 2009 I was preparing for a swim that nobody had ever done before. Marathon swimmers are always looking for a body of water that has never been swum by someone else. The span of ocean between Catalina Island and Santa Barbara Island (SBI) seemed like a perfect spot. Four years earlier I had swum from Catalina Island to Los Angeles and three years earlier I had been part of a relay team that swam from SBI to LA. This stretch of water between Catalina and SBI would be a tough swim for reasons too numerous and mundane for this post.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "By early July, my right shoulder was really hurting during any training swim that exceeded six hours. By late July, the pain was getting very sharp by hour four of each training swim. After an arthrogram (an MRI where they inject contrast directly into the shoulder joint) and a visit with an orthopedic surgeon, we had what appeared to be a diagnosis. I had a torn labrum. The surgeon recommended surgery, which would require being in a sling for six weeks post-op and a period of no swimming for nine months.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "I asked the surgeon if continuing to swim for a few more months, despite the pain, would reduce the chances of a successful surgery. He said no, and so I decided to suck it up and keep training. I did, however, decide to opt out of what I considered would be a very tough Catalina to SBI swim—something I estimated would take at least 12 hours in very rough water—in favor of what I assumed would be a much more manageable LA to Catalina swim.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The story of this swim is one of the most painful of my athletic career. A last-minute change of the current—head on—turned this into 14 hour-plus swim, in some of the roughest chop (first and only time I was ever sick in the water) of which the last eight hours I was screaming under the water from the pain so my crew would not hear me. A week following the swim I had another arthrogram which showed the tear was, more or less the same, but at the last minute I decided to forgo surgery. The thought of not swimming for 9 months was too unappealing.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "By 2012 I was spending more and more time on my bike, but it was clear my right shoulder was getting weaker and weaker, even as I limited my swimming to one hour per day. Soon I could not do many pushups and certainly could not bench press heavier than 135 pounds. I recalled a former swim coach telling me that once it got the point where you could not shampoo your hair, you were hosed. Though I didn’t shampoo my hair, I knew I was at this point in late 2013. I could not bench press an unloaded bar or do even one pushup without terrible pain.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "My friend Terry Laughlin, founder of Total Immersion swimming, used to always tell me when I was learning to swim that practice did not make perfect. Only perfect practice made perfect swimming. This is true in life, of course. Specificity matters a lot. In the same vein, the only reason the Brian Dorfman experiment worked is because it was done correctly, both in terms of what Brian did to me and in terms of what I had to learn about exercising my shoulders.",

  "context": "Exercise & Physical Health",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Both in my own life and in my practice (i.e., in the lives of my patients) it has become so clear that a very proactive strategy is necessary to offset orthopedic injuries as we age. In some cases, like mine, the injuries are brought on by years of overuse. In other cases I see, the injuries are more a result of underuse. I can’t reiterate this next point enough: to pursue physical bliss into your “senior” years (you know, into your 40’s), requires a shockingly deliberate effort and incredible consistency.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Having said that, if a few of these moves feel particularly good and needed for your body, you can also choose to add some of these exercises as part of your regular warm-up routine, or repeat the exercises for multiple sets as part of a circuit. Try not to be concerned that you may not get all your usual strength training exercises done every workout, as these moves take time to do correctly, and will take up some of your budgeted exercise time. As we age, we need to increase our ratio of proper tissue warm up and range of motion practice, relative to actual intense exercise. Tissue becomes less elastic, and motor units lose their signals, so if we don’ use it we lose it. This is true of athletes, and normal civilians.",
