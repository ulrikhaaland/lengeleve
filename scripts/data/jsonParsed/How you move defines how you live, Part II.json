  "content": "In the summer of 2009, during training for a marathon swim, the right shoulder started hurting during any training swim that exceeded six hours. By late July, the pain was getting very sharp by hour four of each training swim. After an arthrogram (an MRI where they inject contrast directly into the shoulder joint) and a visit with an orthopedic surgeon, a torn labrum was diagnosed. The surgeon recommended surgery, which would require being in a sling for six weeks post-op and a period of no swimming for nine months.",

The decision was made to forgo surgery due to the unappealing thought of not swimming for 9 months. Instead, a break was taken from marathon swimming and focus was shifted to Master’s swimming and racing in the pool.",

  "content": "Before the surgery, a physical therapist hypothesized that the tear was not the cause of the pain and complete loss of strength. Instead, the deltoid, triceps, and subscapularis were blamed. The decision was made to delay surgery for six months to give the therapist a chance to work on the fix. Within six months, the shoulder was back to about 80% of previous function and today it’s at 95% which implies no functional limitation and no pain.",
