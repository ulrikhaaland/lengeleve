There’s a competition between the fuels glucose and fat; this is a very old idea called the Randle Hypothesis. Josh has a lot of data that’s consistent with this hypothesis. A lot of tissues make room for glucose to be burned by controlling the amount of fat that’s being used by tissues. The essence of the Randle Hypothesis is that fat is somewhere between “A preferred and THE preferred” fuel for tissues and there’s competition between carbohydrates (classically glucose) and fat, for burning. When fat is available, then glucose tends not to be burned effectively; and that’s a possible cause of diabetes. Fat that’s available for use can come in multiple forms. 1 – Free fatty acids floating in the bloodstream (this may be the most important form). 2 – Adipose stores within tissue, ectopic fat, for example, droplets of fat building up in muscle. 3 – Breakdown of lipoproteins from the bloodstream, things like VLDL, we desperately need to have broken down in order to have a good HDL and a low LDL cholesterol. Recent evidence that supports the Randle Hypothesis. Josh’s experiments examines what can suppress glucose use in tissues. They see very clearly that fat suppresses glucose use. There is a long history of this observation, but maybe it hasn’t been adequately appreciated, just how fundamental that result is.",

The fact that you can have multiple different types of fuels, either fat or lactate, and any of them will suppress glucose use, really makes Josh believe in this kind of competitive nutrient environment and that that plays a central role in determining whether you clear or don’t clear glucose and how high your glucose has to go in order to be cleared. Conversion of glucose to lactate is a quicker path that’s less efficient, but doesn’t require the same cellular oxygen, and you won’t get nearly as much ATP. This also tends to generate a lot of lactate, which tends to gravitate with hydrogen ions, which tends to poison the muscle a little bit.

MCT stands for monocarboxylate, because lactate has 1 carboxylic acid (if you think of it from a chemistry perspective). Jost points out, “I think the really important thing about lactate is that glucose penetration into tissues is actually heavily regulated. It has to be heavily regulated so that if we go through a period of having low carb intake, there’s still glucose preserved for the brain and for other cells that particularly need it. Lactate is the universally available form of carbohydrate. In a healthy heart, at least in the fasted state, it basically will not touch glucose, but it will use lactate as fuel.”",

The main way that nutrients flow into the TCA cycle to become carbon dioxide is first turning into pieces that are 2-carbon units in size. From carbohydrates, the basic flow is glucose to lactate and then lactate to pyruvate (a 2-carbon piece that goes into the TCA cycle). Fat is basically composed of preassembled 2-carbon pieces. Fats just get chopped up 2-carbon pieces at a time. The protein part is a little more complicated, we could probably skip it. Ultimately, unless you’re gaining protein mass, whatever amino acid carbon you take in (in the form of protein) has to be balanced with amino acid catabolism. Amino acid catabolism is not that different from carbs and fat, just a little in that it can enter the TCA cycle sometimes as 4-carbon pieces. A lot of amino acids are broken down in these same 2-carbon pieces. There’s just 20 of them (for the 20 amino acids). These 2-carbon pieces congeal with a 4-carbon piece to make citrate.",

Peter’s takeaway: in 10 years, we’ll look back and see what happened to a generation of women who were deprived of hormone therapy as really unfair and due to a poorly interpreted study.",

That was a life-changing call because it brought him into the world of biomedicine, in the context of working on cancer metabolism. Craig left Penn to go to Memorial Sloan-Kettering shortly after. There is a very natural connection between metabolism and cancer. The first great rational triumph in treating cancer was antifolates and Sidney Farber. His name is memorialized on the Dana-Farber Cancer Center. This is really the origins of how cancer was rationally treated by targeting metabolism. This was understudied for so many years and it was a very natural reentry point for Josh because you can study cancer in isolated cells in a culture dish.

Peter asks: What is it about them metabolically that also is a piece of their signature? Cancers tend to be glucose users, says Josh. Downstream from this, there are a ton of metabolic changes in cancer cells. 1 – The most fundamental change is uncontrolled nucleic acid synthesis. This is needed to support uncontrolled growth. This was targeted initially by Farber and by many subsequent medications that are still widely used today. Pemetrexed is first line treatment for lung cancer. If you get these medications right, you can induce mutations through the metabolic stress on the nucleotide system and this can make immunotherapy work better. Immunotherapy as gotten understudied as cancer metabolism has returned to the fore. There’s been a lot of focus on fuel usage cutoff, which is tough because like most cells in the body, cancer cells can use a lot of different types of fuels depending on what’s available.",

The problem with that logic is no matter how little glucose you eat, you still have plenty of glucose in your circulation, even if you’re in a complete state of starvation. George Cahill’s work, 40 days of starvation, they still had 3 mmol of glucose in their circulation 40 days out. So there is no way to eliminate glucose. Getting glucose below the healthy 89 mg/dL is very difficult. Peter rationalizes that minimizing insulin may be more important than minimizing glucose.

  "context": "Cancer",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There is an idea about exploiting the metabolic quirks of cancer in a way that augments the immune system. Peter has a bias, which is cancer is going to be hard to control so a better strategy is to use multiple modes of action instead of pulling really hard on just 1 lever. Josh points out there are lot of moves to try to make cancer into a chronic disease where the therapies are not so terrible. Hitting the nucleic acid side of cancer for people aiming for maintenance therapy. We need a fresh approach to that whole side of cancer metabolism because think there are targets waiting to be developed. If you can create nucleotide imbalances, which is a natural thing to do when you hit that system, then nucleotide imbalances are drivers of mutations and mutations in cancer cells are drivers of immune response to cancer. Interrupt the ability of cancer cells to synthesize DNA and this will result in more mutations. More mutations create more targets for the immune system. Another exciting avenue is to apply a very strong stress to the cancer while putting pressure on their fuel supply. It will be difficult to put so much pressure on the fuel supply, that this alone will slow tumor growth. But if you combine it with chemotherapy, that’s already targeted to the tumor. And then you pair that with something like ketogenic diet, which is lowering insulin, lowering glucose. Studies in animal models show this can be a very powerful combination. We see that the tumors start to deplete glucose in response to the chemotherapy, whether that’s because their vasculature is breaking down or whether that’s because they have hiding glucose demand because they’re having mitochondrial damage from the chemotherapy. Chemotherapy lowers glucose in the tumor intrinsically, and then if you come in with a diet that lowers glucose availability, this becomes stronger and then you can get to really low tumor glucose. Josh has seen some pretty big improvements in outcome in mouse experiments. Hopefully they’ll translate to the clinic. He has a clinical trial open on this now. What’s the best tool we have to interfere with nucleic acid synthesis in cancer cells? Is it old school chemotherapeutics? For the moment, yes. Pemetrexed is probably the most successful clinical agent. Other good ones are gemcitabine, but we need to think fresh. Josh reflects, “When we were in medical school, I thought we would not see a cure in our lifetimes for hepatitis… but look at that now”. Nucleoside analogs have mainly cured hepatitis. “There’s clearly untapped potential there”‒ Josh Rabinowitz. Josh’s guess is that the chemistry has evolved a lot in the past 40 years and this area is ripe for rediscovery.",

Even more patients respond if you combine gemcitabine and abraxane (an albumin-bound form of paclitaxel) with a platinum agent. That triple combination produces regressions in most patient’s tumors. But the regression is not durable and that’s what kills them. “The duration of response is terrible right now, but the fact there’s response is promise”‒ Josh Rabinowitz. From Josh’s perspective, once you can start seeing a response, you’re on the road. Now they have to figure out how to make the response durable.

There are a lot of things we can do with the timing of macronutrients that can be interesting. Maybe we need to not just think about cycling fasting, and feeding.
