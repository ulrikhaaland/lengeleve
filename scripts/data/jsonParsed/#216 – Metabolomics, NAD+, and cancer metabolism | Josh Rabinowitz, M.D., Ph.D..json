  "content": "Metabolism is the process that converts the food we eat into usable energy and the building blocks our body needs to grow or regenerate itself, as well as waste along the way. Metabolomics is the study of these processes. The bulk of metabolism involves something like a hundred metabolites. Examples of metabolites include all the amino acids and other fundamental inputs we get from our diet, intermediary metabolites, and more effector or energy-holding metabolites like ATP, NADH, NADPH.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The pH spectrum runs from 0 to 14, with neutral pH being 7. The human body is tightly regulated to keep us at a pH of 7-7.7. Many important metabolites live in a 2-3 fold range as being the preferred range. For some metabolites, there is a lot more active regulation (like glucose), while for others, there is a relatively passive process that keeps them in that range. The most important principle in regulating metabolites is: When it’s there, use it up. A lot of what you eat, after a little bit of processing, enters the bloodstream. Then it’s the job of the tissues that need these ingredients to use them, in proportion to their availability in the blood.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The most important regulatory hormone in mammals is insulin. Insulin acts to control elevations in blood sugar by promoting uptake of glucose and preventing production of glucose. Insulin also signals that there are enough carbohydrates around and therefore, it’s safe to not release fat from your adipose tissue. Insulin has two equally important roles: the disposal of glucose into muscle and stopping glucose production in the liver, and stopping lipolysis to keep fat in your fat stores.",

  "date": "August 1, 2022",
  "context": "Cancer",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "When your demand for ATP gets high enough and quick enough, you’re going to basically take glucose and when you turn it into pyruvate, rather than take the efficient path of shuttling pyruvate into Acetyl-CoA through the Krebs Cycle, where you can generate lots of ATP (requiring oxygen), you convert glucose to lactate. This is a quicker path that’s less efficient, but doesn’t require the same cellular oxygen, and you won’t get nearly as much ATP. This also tends to generate a lot of lactate, which tends to gravitate with hydrogen ions, which tends to poison the muscle a little bit. That’s why it becomes rate limiting, in terms of how long you can sustain that level of output.",

There is an evolutionary reason for allowing most tissues to use lactate directly as a fuel instead of relying on the liver to mop it up. The system would be way less flexible if only the liver could clean this up. It would also be way less commensurate with effective bursts of exercise.",

  "content": "Fasting lactate levels could be a potential early indicator of metabolic dysfunction. There seems to be a correlation between fasting glucose and fasting lactate. When fasting lactate is high, it reflects the fact that during these times of fasting, when glucose is not really supposed to be used much, you’re still using too much glucose. You’re converting too much glucose to lactate. At the same time that your lactate clearance system isn’t working very well. Typically, that’s because you’re having competition between lactate and fat to be burned.",

In a healthy adult, every carbon atom that you eat in any of those three forms needs to exit your body as exhaled carbon dioxide. All of that exhaled carbon dioxide is made in the TCA cycle (aka the Krebs cycle). The main way that nutrients flow into the TCA cycle to become carbon dioxide is first turning into pieces that are 2-carbon units in size. The Krebs cycle is probably 3x as important as anything else in metabolism.",
