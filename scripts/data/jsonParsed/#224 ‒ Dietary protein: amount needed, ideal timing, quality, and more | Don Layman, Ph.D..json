  "content": "Don Layman is a Professor Emeritus of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he served as a member of the faculty, as well as the chair of Foods and Nutrition, the Director of Human Ecology and the Associate Dean of Agriculture. He earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Chemistry at Illinois State University and his doctorate in Human Nutrition and Biochemistry at the University of Minnesota. Don was interested in biochemistry first. In college Don first studied biochemistry and organic chemistry. This was the serendipity of how he got into nutrition; he didn’t know anything about it. He first went to Illinois State University to study chemistry. He realized quickly he had no aptitude for inorganic chemistry, but he understood biochemistry pretty well. This was during the Vietnam War and he was scheduled to go into the military. He was totally unemployable. So when the university offered him a graduate assistantship, he took it and got a master’s in biochemistry. His mentor at the time said, “You really have a knack for this nutrition part of it. Why don’t you do a PhD?” He ended up at University of Minnesota doing a Ph.D. in nutritional biochemistry and fell in love with all of it. There was no grand plan, but it fit his background of agriculture, foods, sports nutrition. He fell into a group that was doing muscle metabolism and it just all fell together for him.",

  "content": "What was your underlying philosophy of nutrition circa 1975, when you were doing your Ph.D? Don’s research has focused on muscle development, protein and amino acid metabolism, and nutrition in the context of athletic performance, obesity, diabetes, and cardiometabolic health. In this episode, we talk about Don’s background, his interest in protein, muscle, insulin, and  anabolic factors in general. We talk about the nuances of animal versus plant protein. We talk about the difference in protein requirements between children and adults, even normalized to mass. And we talk about what happens to children who are protein deficient early in life. Then we look specifically at protein needs under various circumstances. For example, what’s the maximum amount of protein that can be consumed and used in one sitting which will still contribute to muscle protein synthesis. We talk about the ideal timing of consuming protein throughout the day and around exercise. We talk about the importance of protein quality when looking at how much or how little a person consumes. Then we talk about how these things change as you age.",

Very early he developed  the philosophy that nutrition was really about two tissues, the brain and skeletal muscle. If those two tissues were healthy, you were going to live a pretty good life. Everything else is regulatory‒ the liver, the heart, the kidney, the gut. Everything else adapts to your environment, but you have to focus on those first two. He coined the concept that his colleague, Dr. Gabrielle Lyon and he always use‒ muscle centric nutrition. If you keep muscle healthy, you’ve got a good shot at avoiding obesity, avoiding diabetes, avoiding cancer, etc.",

This creates a problem in that it makes it  harder for muscle to accept carbohydrates. This leads to hyperglycemia and ultimately diabetes.",

Peter mentioned glucose storage but he looks at it more in terms of glucose utilization and fat utilization. Blood glucose and blood lipids are heavily dependent on muscle metabolism. Obviously the amount you eat makes a difference. But the actual level is heavily dependent on your muscle metabolism.",

If you chronically elevate insulin for too long, that is the definition of type 2 diabetes. Peter spoke with Jerry Schulman on the podcast about 2 years ago. His paradigm was the accumulation of diglycerides within actual myocytes, not interstitial or in between. The actual accumulation of lipid within muscle cells impairs insulin signaling resulting in decreased PI3K activation. This removes the signal needed to move the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell membrane (and glucose is not taken into the muscle cell). Hyperinsulinemia is effectively the first way you can externally measure insulin resistance.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Is this in line with what you’re saying? Yes and no.  Don agrees Jerry Shulman is great and he follows his research a lot. In biochemistry you can create models that give negative feedback. Schulman is correct that diacylglycerol or ceramides (lipids/ fats) will feed back to the insulin receptor, GLUT4 transport, and cause insulin resistance. That is a fat centric philosophy, that fat causes all the problem. You can do the exact same thing with glucose. Too much glucose will also inhibit the insulin receptor and cause that same exact feedback. It doesn’t cause accumulation of ceramides or diacylglycerides. The question becomes‒ Which one is more likely to be physiological? Is insulin resistance due to people eating 350 grams of carbs per day? Or people eating 90 grams of fat per day? The Randle hypothesis claims that fatty acids (diacylglycerol) cause all the problems. Bob Wolfe did this experiment with stable isotopes and showed it’s the reverse. Fatty acids are not inherently toxic but glucose is. Glucose has its own disease, diabetes. When you eat excess carbs, you must get rid of them. Carbs absolutely have to be disposed of in the next 2 hours. Fat can hang around for much longer, it’s not that toxic to the body. The body always wants to have a certain level of free fatty acids in the blood because that’s fuel for the heart. What about the ability to turn excess glucose into fatty acid via de novo lipogenesis? Doesn’t that happen quickly enough to alleviate some of the toxicity of acute hyperglycemia?",

  "content": "A lot of people argue how much de novo lipogenesis (fat synthesis) actually occurs. But when you get into requiring high amounts of de novo lipogenesis, now we start talking about fatty liver. People who are actually doing a lot of de novo lipogenesis typically have elevated triglycerides; that’s one of the first signs that you’re disrupting that flow. Triglycerides in general are there to recycle free fatty acids. Adipose tissue is always dumping free fatty acids out for the heart and other tissues. The problem comes in when you start blending that with too many carbs and too many fats. Peter adds, “There’s a very famous paper by Marc Hellerstein circa mid 90s, that demonstrates really a very small amount of de novo lipogenesis taking place with carbohydrate feeding.  I absolutely believe the results of the paper, but I also think it’s a very narrow context and it’s not necessarily the context of an overfed individual.”  He thinks our capacity for de novo lipogenesis (DNL) depends heavily on total energy content or total energy balance. Conversely, you can feed a high carbohydrate diet in the context of a high energy diet and we would probably see a much greater amount of DNL.",

You have to dispose of the glucose. If you take in a 1,000 calorie meal or an 800 calorie meal, which one will result in more fat synthesis? The carbohydrate will get burned and the fat will go to fat. But if you switch that to a diet of 80% carb and 10% fat then you’ll see de novo lipogenesis. Jules Hirsch showed this and Jeff Volek also showed this. One of the interesting things is that when the body makes fat, the only type it can make is saturated fat. Having a lot of saturated fat in the blood doesn’t actually come from eating fat, it comes from eating carbs. We burn around 100 calories per hour; that would be 2,400 calories per day. So in 2 hours you’re burning 200 calories. Everything else has to be stored. An average American meal is 400 to 1,000 calories; that means you have to store all of that.",

This turned out to be an artifact of how he did the study. He showed that when animals made the adaptation to small meals, the animals didn’t gain as much as if you adapted them to eating 2 meals per day. The artifact was, when an animal adapts to 2 meals per day, they go through a starvation period and when they come out of a starvation period, they make more fat. Don redid the study with a longer adaptation period and found that reducing the number of meals per day is actually thermogenically advantageous. You actually waste more calories. 2 – The other aspect to consider is protein. Protein needs to be distributed at specific meals, and the distribution needs to be high. Eating lots of small meals is a really bad choice for a lot of reasons.",

Then the body begins to reconnect them based on the messenger RNAs. Our DNA tells us how to reconnect them. And so we connect a carbon [carboxyl end] to a nitrogen [amino end] and we string them together. All of the 20 amino acids are different, they go into proteins and form different structures. Proteins can be simple like insulin with 51 amino acids or they could be like myosin with thousands of amino acids. But beyond that building block structure, every amino acid has other kinds of structures. It might be like lysine where part of it becomes the molecule known as carnitine, which is needed for fatty acid metabolism. Or it might be the nitrogen off arginine that goes to nitric oxide for vessel restriction. Or it might be cysteine, which goes to part of glutathione.

It gets even more complicated, in that when you have higher leucine‒  it begins to inhibit pyruvate from going into the mitochondria. So when you oxidize a leucine, the nitrogen that comes off of it is put onto pyruvate, generating alanine, and so the body begins to recycle glucose. It becomes steady state on glucose and emphasizes fat oxidation. If you overload all of that, you can make leucine inhibit carbohydrate oxidation. So if you have huge amounts of carbs coming in, and then you overload the system with leucine, and you’ll inhibit pyruvate oxidation. So that could look like insulin resistance. But if you look at the physiology of how it’s supposed to work, under conditions where you’d be burning fat, leucine actually stimulates fat oxidation and spares glucose for the brain and other tissues.",
