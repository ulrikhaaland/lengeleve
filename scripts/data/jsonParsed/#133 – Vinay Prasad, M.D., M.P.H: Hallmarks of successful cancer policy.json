  "content": "The uniquely challenging field of oncology. At Chicago, had really good mentors in internal medicine and many students chose it. Wanted to have a broad look at the body and think broadly. Considered a few other specialties like cardiology and critical care. Had a great experience with oncologists at Northwestern. One was Hidayatullah Munshi, who’s still there on faculty: he knew basic science, clinical trials, and evidence, and also had great a bedside manner. Vinay saw them making decisions he thought were “substantive and important” and decided to go into oncology too. Vinay went to the National Cancer Institute, it’s a unique and fascinating program. Internal medicine doesn’t teach you much about oncology—so steep learning curve, new drugs, diseases, genetics. “To be honest I probably think that’s one of my favorite years of training, my first year as an oncology fellow. … We were learning 20 new things every day. I thought it was really a terrific and transformational year for me.” Peter says NCI is a special place: “It’s not hyperbolic to say there’s no place like it on earth. I still remember that first day I stepped foot on that campus as a third year medical student just thinking, how can this place exist? It is so marvelous.” A lot of fundamental work took place there. Anyone training in medicine should spend some time there. Oncology is challenging because what we call “cancer” is really very dissimilar diseases. There is variation even within cancer types. Example: non-small cell lung cancer, which itself is a category of lung cancer, can be further divided into categories like EGFR mutation type, ALK rearrangement type, RET, and ROS1. We have all these molecular categories, we have RAS, this undruggable target. We have superimposed that with the role of immunotherapy. To keep up, Vinay reads an article or two every night, reads Up to Date and looks at the references. Still so much he doesn’t know. “I once heard somebody say 1963 was the last time a scientist died who knew everything. It’s just impossible to know it all.” He sees patients about half the time and bases what he needs to learn off that. Start with the patient and work your way outward, he’s still learning 6 years into practice.",

  "content": "This hallmark is about conflicts of interest. Industry ties to those who should be watching: it funds patient advocacy groups, rotating door with industry and FDA, most expert oncologists get drug funding and sometimes support questionable drugs. Drug reps buy residents lunches, unique pens, etc. It’s small but a hook, the beginning of a slippery slope. These problems have largely been curtailed through a number of well-intentioned efforts. But reform has focused too much on the low end – pens, meals – than on the high end (e.g., oncologists who get $100K+ per year in funding, even millions in research funding). Even when controlling for research funding, prior publications, and seniority, Vinay found that “personal payments from the industry are associated with greater publication in the future.” Guidelines written by people making large amounts of money from industry. And the guidelines, by law in the US, make Medicare pay for drugs for off-label purposes.",

José Baselga: did not mention highly relevant conflicts in many articles. Pushed out of  Memorial Sloan Kettering. But became vice president of the drug company AstraZeneca, a job that likely pays a few times as much money as he was making earlier.  Not exactly a punishment. We don’t really take disclosure seriously. Some psychology / business evidence suggests that if someone discloses you might actually trust them more. Divestment is a better way.",

Who decides whether or not we should recommend that routinely or not? The guidelines will shape how many doctors practice and they should be made by doctors without a conflict of interest. “It’s like a courtroom where the prosecutor and the defense are both being paid by the defendant”. We need profit to drive innovation, but it needs to be separated from the people who are supposed to monitor and push back on drug companies. Our professional societies and senior leadership at universities and academic medical centers are driven by industry payments.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "when we give cancer drugs, we care about two things: increased survival or health related quality of life. In our current system: One third of approved drugs shrink tumors more than 30% in a fraction of people. One third delay tumor growth by 20%. One third allow you to live longer and/or better. So we’re spending all this money on costly drugs, but only about a third actually affects what actually matters to people. The other two thirds you’re measuring tumor size on CAT scans. Why do we use tumor shrinkage of 30% as a cutoff? Goes back to a 1976 paper where oncologists measured marbles under foam rubber with calipers. The size difference at which two doctors could reliably tell the marble had gotten bigger or smaller became the cut point. And that cut point is what we still use today. So why put so much stock in drugs with a 10 or 20% response rate? Cutoffs are arbitrary and tell you nothing about whether patient lives longer or better.",

We should ask why we subsidize marginal drugs the same way we subsidize transformative drugs. To correct the market, incentivize drugs that have more substantive benefits and don’t pay so much for those drugs that really don’t add a lot, don’t cure people and just prolong survival very modestly in very select cohorts.",

Peter and his colleagues debate with each other, 'but we never lose sight of the fact that it’s not an intellectual pursuit. At the end, a decision needs to be made'.
