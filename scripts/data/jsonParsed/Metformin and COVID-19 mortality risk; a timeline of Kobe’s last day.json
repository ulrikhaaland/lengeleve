  "content": "This meta-analysis of 5 retrospective cohort studies showed that metformin use in (mostly) diabetics was associated with a reduced risk of dying from a COVID-19 infection compared to diabetics not taking the drug. Results from a meta-analysis reported a 1.9x increased odds of death (i.e., double, orÂ  100%) associated with having diabetes. A single population-level cohort study reported a 7.3% mortality rate among people with diabetes compared to a 2.3% mortality rate in the overall population (i.e., an unadjusted 3-fold increased odds of death). With the associated risk of diabetes and COVID-19 mortality in mind, the study of metformin reported that taking the drug was associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital death in diabetics by about half (59%). Once the study adjusted for co-varying risk factors like age, obesity, and hypertension metformin was associated with a 67% reduced risk of death in diabetics on metformin.",

  "content": "The article is a timeline of the day Kobe died in the helicopter crash that also killed his daughter Gigi and seven other people. The article crafts the mosaic of details with peripheral accounts of some on the ground: like that of a hiker who, while waiting for a friend, reported the sight of a helicopter flying overhead which then disappeared into a patch of clouds; or the account of two mountain bikers who, while taking a break on a trail, saw the helicopter rolling in the air and into the hillside, bursting into flames.",

  "content": "The article is wonderfully crafted, providing appreciative detail of the event. But such detail also leaves me without words and with sorrow for those killed and their families. It is a shock that evokes the first time I heard the news a little more than a year ago on January 26, 2020, news that continues to arrest me and our culture.",
