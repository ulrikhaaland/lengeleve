  "content": "Likelihood of injury risk markedly decreased. Your ability to even sweat and perspire is determined by how much sleep that you get. The time it takes to reach physical exhaustion increases. When you are sleep deprived, the brain receives a signal that is not dissimilar to starvation. It releases a cascade of hormones that change your appetite profile. So you’ll want to eat more. And you’re less satisfied after you eat food. This is because when the body undergoes sleep deprivation, the brain thinks, “Oh, I must be under conditions of starvation… I must stay awake and forage for food.” But it’s a “fake starvation signal” which increases a hormone called ghrelin (which makes you want to eat more) and it suppresses a hormone called leptin (which gives you a feeling of fullness).",
