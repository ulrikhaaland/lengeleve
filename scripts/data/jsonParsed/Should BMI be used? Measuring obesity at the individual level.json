  "content": "Superior tools for measuring obesity at the individual level include DEXA scans which provide 4 points of information: 1) % body fat 2) Visceral fat (VAT, visceral adipose tissue) 3) Bone mineral density 4) Appendicular Lean Mass Index, a measure of muscle mass. It also provides information about subcutaneous fat, but that doesn’t seem to matter because it is incredibly genetic and relatively uncoupled from metabolic health. VAT, the visceral adipose tissue seems to be much more tightly correlated to what we see when we look at more sophisticated biomarkers of insulin sensitivity and metabolic health, and any evidence of liver fat.",
