They did a meta-analysis of seven placebo-controlled statin trials and analyzed the relationship of baseline and on-treatment Lp(a) to risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. An Lp(a) of 50 mg/dL or higher, at baseline or on-treatment, “was associated with an increased hazard ratio of cardiovascular events independent of other cardiovascular risk factors and evident on treatment with either statin or placebo.”",

  "content": "In other words, statins are not addressing the associated risk in patients with an elevated Lp(a), and this population represents about 25% of those with previous CVD or an indication for statins. They make a strong case that clinical trials with drugs that can lower Lp(a) specifically are needed to determine if these patients can reduce their risk.",
