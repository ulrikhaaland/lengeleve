  "content": "The answer lies in how the rice kernel molecular structure transforms as a result of the manufacturing process. A rice kernel is predominantly made up of starch granules. Starch is a polysaccharide, which means that it is made up of a series of glucose molecules linked together. The transformative process has 3 steps: (1) preliminary cooking exposes the starch granule to water that later expands as gas under high temperature, (2) rolling the granule damages its structure and allows for (3) kernel puffing when the absorbed water vaporizes and forcibly expands the granule. As a function of temperature and water content changes over the course of the whole process, the kernel undergoes a glass transition where the starch granule structure becomes more disordered and more rigidly bound. Once the Rice Krispies hit the cereal bowl and absorb liquid (milk), the moisture content increases and the kernel goes from glassy to rubbery. The pockets of trapped air release as the walls of the kernel are weakened, which in turn break the parts of the structure that are still glassy, forcing the Snap! Crackle! Pop!",

  "content": "In summary, the 3-way comparison produced the following results: Compared to plain white rice, Rice Krispies produced a higher and faster glycemic response on a gram-for-gram basis. And both rice foods induced a higher and faster glycemic response compared to the Generation UCAN product.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Generation UCAN undergoes a unique hydrothermal processing treatment that renders the corn starch molecule a Superstarch. The created glucose polymer is 250 to 2,000 times larger than all other simple and complex carbohydrates and has an extended, slow release. There are two notable attributes of the hydrothermally modified starch: it is semi-resistant to digestion, although it eventually undergoes complete digestion, and it does not tend to spike insulin levels.",

  "content": "The induced glycemic response from the 3 different starch products illustrates the nuance in how food processing can impact nutritional absorption. While food processing is most commonly associated with an increased glycemic response to that food, the Generation UCAN product gives an alternative: from a glycemic load standpoint, not all “processed” food is unfavorable.",
