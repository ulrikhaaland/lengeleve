  "content": "A rice kernel is predominantly made up of starch granules. Starch is a polysaccharide, which means that it is made up of a series of glucose molecules linked together. The transformative process has 3 steps: preliminary cooking exposes the starch granule to water that later expands as gas under high temperature, rolling the granule damages its structure and allows for kernel puffing when the absorbed water vaporizes and forcibly expands the granule. The steam bubbles that form within the network of starch granules also expand the kernel’s structure until its walls reach their elasticity limit and there is a sudden loss of water when the bubbles break open. But some gas stays trapped in the kernel walls because not all bubbles break open.",

  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "As a function of temperature and water content changes over the course of the whole process, the kernel undergoes a glass transition where the starch granule structure becomes more disordered and more rigidly bound. Once the Rice Krispies hit the cereal bowl and absorb liquid, the moisture content increases and the kernel goes from glassy to rubbery. The pockets of trapped air release as the walls of the kernel are weakened, which in turn break the parts of the structure that are still glassy, forcing the Snap! Crackle! Pop!",

  "title": "Glycemic Response to Rice Krispies",
  "date": "April 25, 2021",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Compared to plain white rice, Rice Krispies produced a higher and faster glycemic response on a gram-for-gram basis. And both rice foods induced a higher and faster glycemic response compared to the Generation UCAN product. The glycemic response hierarchy is not so surprising, considering that food metabolism changes with molecular structure alterations. In most instances, processed foods produce a higher glycemic response compared to their non-processed counterparts.",

  "date": "April 25, 2021",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Generation UCAN undergoes a unique hydrothermal processing treatment that renders the corn starch molecule a Superstarch. The created glucose polymer is 250 to 2,000 times larger than all other simple and complex carbohydrates and has an extended, slow release. There are two notable attributes of the hydrothermally modified starch: it is semi-resistant to digestion, although it eventually undergoes complete digestion, and it does not tend to spike insulin levels.",

  "content": "The induced glycemic response from the 3 different starch products illustrates the nuance in how food processing can impact nutritional absorption. While food processing is most commonly associated with an increased glycemic response to that food, the Generation UCAN product gives an alternative: from a glycemic load standpoint, not all “processed” food is unfavorable.",
