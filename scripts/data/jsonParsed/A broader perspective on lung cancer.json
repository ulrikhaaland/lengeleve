  "content": "In 2021, an estimated 608,570 lives were lost in the U.S. to cancer. Almost one-quarter of these deaths (131,880) were due to lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. About 82% of lung cancer deaths are attributable to cigarette smoking. Another 3% are attributable to second-hand smoke exposure. Smoking continues to be the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S.",

  "content": "The scary truth is that people who never smoke can develop and die from lung cancer, too. Lung cancer among “never-smokers” – defined as individuals who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime – ranks among the top 10 causes of cancer death among both sexes combined. Lung cancer rates among never-smokers are rising. The proportion of lung cancer cases among never-smokers vs. smokers is rising.",

  "date": "March 5, 2022",
  "context": "Cancer",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A similar controversy surrounds the question of how gender affects risk of lung cancer among never-smokers. Women have a larger fraction of nonsmoking-related lung cancer than men, with 60% of cases occurring in women. A recent study suggests that women who’ve never smoked are more likely to develop lung cancer than men who’ve never smoked.",

  "content": "Other risk factors unrelated to smoking include genetic predispositions and a family history of lung cancer. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), radon exposure is the number one cause of lung cancer among non-smokers in the U.S. Pollution constitutes another important risk factor for the development of lung cancer. According to a 2020 analysis, an estimated 14.1% of lung cancer deaths worldwide are attributable to outdoor air pollution.",

  "content": "One possibility is that hormonal factors play a role. Estrogen receptors are expressed in normal lung tissue and in lung adenocarcinomas, the most common type of lung cancer among never-smokers. Studies in mice further suggest that the development of lung cancer is influenced by sex hormones.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Screening – typically through low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans – certainly offers one avenue for reducing lung cancer mortality, as early detection is associated with greater survival rates. However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends regular lung cancer screenings only for adults aged 50 through 80 with a history of smoking. Delays in diagnoses among never-smokers are further exacerbated by the stigma associated with lung cancer due to its association with smoking.",

Educating the public on the causative link between smoking and lung cancer has led to a reduction in smoking prevalence among both youth and adult groups in areas where such measures have been taken, and lung cancer rates have begun to decline as a result.",

Further research is critical for elucidating how other factors may contribute, and public health recommendations, educational campaigns, and medical practitioners should acknowledge that never-smokers – and in particular, female never-smokers – are not immune to this disease.",
