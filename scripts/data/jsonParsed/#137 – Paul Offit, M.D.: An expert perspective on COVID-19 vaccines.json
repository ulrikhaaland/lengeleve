Unfortunately, a solid number of people continue to believe this, despite the efforts of people like Brian Deer, Peter Hotez, and Paul who have so thoroughly debunked it.

Then you know that you should just need to mimic that part of the immune response that’s associated with protection to create an effective vaccine. The rotavirus is ubiquitous—every mammal has its own unique strand of a rotavirus. However, a rotavirus in a cow, for example, would not cause the same severity of disease if introduced to a human (though it may induce immunity). So the initial approach was just to take a cow virus, a calf virus, that had caused diarrhea, and adapt it to growth in cell culture and then use that as the human—”And it did work, but it was inconsistent.” From there they modified the calf virus—they made a combination virus, aka reassortant viruses, between calf and animal strains that became the vaccine (way oversimplified explanation). You don’t know if they will behave differently in people. For example, a previous rotavirus vaccine caused intussusception (intestinal blockage) in some people.",

The good news about SARS-CoV-2: 1) We know a lot about the spike protein in the virus that attaches the virus to cells which means, in theory, you should be able to prevent the virus from infecting cells 2) We also know the gene that codes for that protein—It’s a single-stranded messenger RNA (mRNA) virus like rubella or German measles. So the initial coronavirus vaccine strategies are all based on that knowledge. The mRNA strategy would work like this: You take the messenger RNA, which codes for that spike protein, you inject it into people. It’s taken up by the cell cytoplasm, the outside of the nucleus, it enters the ribosomal system, and is translated to a protein. Put simply, your body makes the coronavirus spike protein and then your body makes antibodies to the spike protein. Similar strategies: “genetic plug and play vaccines” — the below have a similar strategy to mRNA vaccines which is to introduce the gene that codes for the coronavirus spike protein, induce your body to make that spike protein and then your body will make antibodies. 1) So called “DNA vaccines” 2) Virus vector vaccines such as: Replication-defective simian, or human, adenovirus vaccines Replication-competent vectored vaccines. These plus the mRNA vaccines are likely to be the first ones to come out because they’re the easiest to construct and the easiest to mass-produce (but doesn’t mean they’ll work the best).",

Astrazeneca is using a replication-defective simian (chimpanzee) adenovirus. Paul has concern for the safety of these strategies based on three clinical holds so far. With Johnson & Johnson’s product… This was as a replication-defective adenovirus 26 which was genetically engineered so it contains the gene that codes for the coronavirus spike proteins. With the Astrazeneca product… There were two clinical holds for the replication-defective simian adenovirus both because of neurological issues. The first was so-called undiagnosed multiple sclerosis. The second was transverse myelitis — an inflammation of the segment of the spinal cord.",

If the virus is more like measles, there won’t be enough genetic drift to alter the serotype, and a vaccine could provide immunity for a long time.

However, this adds up to about 150 million adults, which is half the adult population in the United States, and it is not feasible to vaccinate them all immediately. The Department of Defense will take the lead at Operation Warp Speed for determining where the vaccines get distributed, but the states will decide. It will be a challenge to get the vaccines out there, as it is a two-dose vaccine and some of them need to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius.",

Hypothetically, at a sample size of 30,000 with a third of them over 65, 10,000 people over 65 having no adverse effects in three months would make him feel comfortable enough to take it. What scares Paul the most about COVID-19 is the possibility that it can cause vasculitis or cardiomyopathy. It can cause heart attacks, strokes, liver or kidney disease because it causes vasculitis. People that experience long COVID, at least in part, are probably determined by a vasculitis, maybe even at a low level. This virus should be taken seriously.",

To get to the children, this could be done in one or two ways: First, it could be done as placebo-controlled trials, the same way we do adults.",

Peter said his article is changing the way he thinks about his use of Tylenol with his kids. Studies repeatedly show that the people who are giving anti-fever medicines like Tylenol or ibuprofen do worse. And in the world of vaccines, when people choose to treat fever with anti-fever medicines when they’ve gotten the vaccine, you have a lesser immune response. Physiological fevers don’t cause harm, but environmental fevers can (e.g., heatstroke). Paul urges that we need to give the immune system a chance to work as good as it can: Why cripple his neutrophils’ ability to ingest and kill bacteria by giving anti-fever medicines? Only if somebody cannot handle the metabolic strain of increased temperature. But otherwise, no.",

There’s no vaccine for it — Is that just that it’s not cost-effective, or was there sort of a more technical issue with it? More a technical issue of creating a vaccine, says Paul. Bob Chanock, head of the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases at NIH, wanted to make an RSV vaccine because it causes pneumonia and can be fatal in young children, especially babies. After being vaccinated and THEN getting exposed to the natural virus, they were more likely to develop pneumonia and more likely to be hospitalized than if they got the virus without first having a vaccine. The reason that may be relevant to SARS-CoV-2 is that both of those viruses, respiratory syncytial virus and measles, have a fusion protein just like SARS-CoV-2.",
