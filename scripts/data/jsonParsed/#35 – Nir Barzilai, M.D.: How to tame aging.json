  "content": "Lp(a) actually increases in centenarians (which would be a bad thing in the gen. pop). We show cross-sectionally that Lp(a) drops until the age of 80 (by half). It should be flat, so why is it increasing? ⇒ “Because it’s a protected aging gene”. Most of the people with high Lp(a) that are centenarians are also CETP VV mutations. Different Lp(a) phenotypes? ⇒ Peter’s hypothesis. Peter asks, “Why wouldn’t Lp(a) flatline after age 80? In other words, I understand why CETP VV is protective. I don’t understand why Lp(a) should concentrate.” Perhaps there are different phenotypes of the Lp(a). Most people with high Lp(a) die of premature heart disease, but a significant number do not. This makes Peter wonder, “are there virulent and nonvirulent phenotypes that at the level of expression by number, or molecular weight, that are not captured?” If so, the next question becomes… “Is the nonvirulent one the one that is concentrating in the centenarians?”",

Prevalence of the CETP VV mutation: At 55 [years old] it’s 8% of the population and at 100 it’s 20% of the population.",

  "content": "Nir’s been trying to develop antibodies against the IGF receptor (IGF-1R) because IGF-1R is expressed in many cancers. Nir’s hypothesis about IGF: you need to decrease IGF action in the periphery, but increase it in the brain. Gave the IGF-1R antibody to 22-month-old female mice that are 70, 75 years of age equivalent. They increased their health span dramatically and increased their lifespan by 9%. Nir’s final take on giving GH to patients: “So I’m telling you from human studies, from genetic studies, I’m telling you growth hormone treatment is not beneficial. It should be dangerous for elderly people. For elderly women. With men, I’m ready to say that I’m not sure. It’s not that I’ve shown that low IGF or growth hormone is better in males. Not in my rodent studies and not in my human studies. But it’s hard to say that giving growth hormone is bad. Peter thinks the most obvious way to manipulate IGF is through fasting.",

  "content": "Nir’s small clinical study trying to tie the animal data to the biology of humans. They studied 14 ~70-year-olds in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial where they were treated with metformin and placebo for six weeks each. Metformin lowered 2‐hour glucose, insulin AUC, and insulin secretion compared to placebo. 647 genes were differentially expressed in muscle and 146 genes were differentially expressed in adipose tissue. “While each tissue had a signature reflecting its own function, we identified a cascade of predictive upstream transcriptional regulators, including mTORC1, MYC, TNF, TGFß1, and miRNA‐29b that may explain tissue‐specific transcriptomic changes in response to metformin treatment. This study provides the first evidence that, in older adults, metformin has metabolic and nonmetabolic effects linked to aging. These data can inform the development of biomarkers for the effects of metformin, and potentially other drugs, on key aging pathways.”",
