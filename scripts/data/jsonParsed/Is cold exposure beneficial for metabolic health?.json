  "content": "Cold exposure therapies are forms of short exposure to cold temperatures. Goals of cold exposure therapy include boosting energy expenditure and improving metabolic health. In cold environments, the body must produce more heat to maintain its temperature, thus burning more calories. One mechanism by which mammals are known to produce heat is through skeletal muscle shivering. Another is known as “nonshivering thermogenesis” and relies principally on a specialized type of adipose tissue called brown fat.",

  "date": "April 23, 2022",
  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Brown fat, or brown adipose tissue (BAT), is far more metabolically active than white adipose tissue (WAT). The mitochondria in BAT are designed to “waste” energy in the form of heat. When mammals are exposed to cold conditions, the sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine, stimulating brown fat to burn energy and create heat to maintain core body temperature. In humans, the thermogenic capacity of brown fat is most important during infancy. However, small deposits of brown fat persist through adulthood in vital regions of the body, especially around the neck and upper shoulders.",

  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In humans, BAT volume cannot be measured directly, as BAT cells are intermingled with WAT cells and other tissues. Instead, BAT volume is estimated from measurement of BAT metabolic activity. The gold standard for measuring BAT activity in laboratory studies is positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging. When activated, BAT increases its uptake of glucose and free fatty acids from the bloodstream, acting as a “metabolic sink” to fuel thermogenesis.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The estimated mass of BAT in adults is small, ranging from 10-300g. It is estimated that 50 g of BAT is responsible for roughly 5% of resting energy expenditure, or 75-100 kcal per day. During short-term mild cold exposure, when BAT is most active, glucose uptake per gram of BAT is greater than uptake per gram of skeletal muscle. However, skeletal muscle mass far exceeds BAT mass, so in considering each of these tissues in total, BAT is not going to have nearly the effect on metabolism that skeletal muscle has.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Cold exposure therapies are based on a known and reliable mechanism of BAT activation. Even seasonal changes in temperature have been correlated to increased BAT activity. Still, despite the high metabolic capacity of active BAT, its overall contribution to total energy expenditure is fairly small in adults. Indeed, even when looking exclusively at cold-induced increases in energy expenditure, BAT activity contributes only a relatively small percentage compared with both shivering and nonshivering activity in skeletal muscle.",

  "content": "Cold exposure therapies may influence alternative pathways besides BAT, which might account for the observed effects of these practices on inflammation and the cardiovascular, endocrine, and nervous systems. Pharmacological interventions may someday be capable of activating BAT and/or triggering beiging of WAT to a far greater extent than appears possible by cold exposure, potentially opening the door for BAT activation to become a viable option for driving meaningful increases in energy expenditure. However, when it comes to using cold exposure therapies to activate BAT, the benefits are likely too small to make any difference for metabolic health.",
