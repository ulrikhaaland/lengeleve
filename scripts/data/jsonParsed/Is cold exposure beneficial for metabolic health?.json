  "content": "Cold exposure therapies are forms of short exposure to cold temperatures (which don’t have to be as extreme as Norway in mid-winter). Cold showers, ice baths, open water swimming, and even short walks in cold weather are all forms of cold exposure therapy. Goals of cold exposure therapy include boosting energy expenditure and improving metabolic health. Though the precise activities and durations may vary, for the purpose of improving metabolic health, cold exposure therapies are all rooted in the same simple rationale: production of heat (known as “thermogenesis”) requires an expenditure of energy. In cold environments, the body must produce more heat to maintain its temperature, thus burning more calories. One mechanism by which mammals are known to produce heat is through skeletal muscle shivering. Another is known as “nonshivering thermogenesis” and relies principally on a specialized type of adipose tissue called brown fat.",

  "title": "What is brown fat?",
  "date": "April 23, 2022",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Brown fat, or brown adipose tissue (BAT), gets its name from its difference in color relative to white adipose tissue (WAT), which constitutes the vast majority of fat in the human body. Unlike WAT, BAT contains a high concentration of iron-rich mitochondria, which, in addition to giving the tissue a brown color, make BAT far more metabolically active than WAT. The mitochondria in BAT are unique from those in other body tissues, however. Instead of harnessing energy and converting it to chemical forms (ATP) that the cell can use to support its normal functions, BAT mitochondria are designed to “waste” energy in the form of heat. When mammals are exposed to cold conditions, the sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine, stimulating brown fat to burn energy and create heat to maintain core body temperature. Smaller mammals lose heat easily due to their relatively high surface area to volume ratio, and thus need to generate more heat to maintain core body temperature against cold environments than larger mammals.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In humans, the thermogenic capacity of brown fat is most important during infancy. Newborns, like other small mammals, have a high surface area to volume ratio and a relatively low quantity of insulating WAT at birth. Therefore, it makes sense that about 5% of a newborn’s body weight is BAT, a much higher percentage than adults. As we age, we lose a lot of the brown fat with which we were born and transition to muscle shivering as the predominant form of thermogenesis in cold conditions. However, small deposits of brown fat persist through adulthood in vital regions of the body, especially around the neck and upper shoulders.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "For my self-experimentation in Norway, I was not going to have a PET/CT scan following my stint in the cold, so instead I used an infrared camera to capture a thermal map of my skin surface. As you’ll hear us discuss in the video below, the measurement of BAT activation is based on a “delta” – or the change in the thermal measurements before vs. after cold-exposure. And it turns out, I had the largest change in BAT activity in response to the cold!",

  "date": "April 23, 2022",
  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The estimated mass of BAT in adults is small, ranging from 10-300g. It is estimated that 50 g of BAT is responsible for roughly 5% of resting energy expenditure, or 75-100 kcal per day. During short-term mild cold exposure, when BAT is most active, glucose uptake per gram of BAT is greater than uptake per gram of skeletal muscle. However, skeletal muscle mass far exceeds BAT mass, so in considering each of these tissues in total, BAT is not going to have nearly the effect on metabolism that skeletal muscle has. This is clear from measurements of energy expenditure changes during cold exposure: while overall energy expenditure increases up to 250-300 kcal/24 h, the contribution of BAT activity accounts for <20 kcal/24 h, even in individuals with relatively high amounts of BAT. The remaining increase in energy expenditure is attributed to thermogenesis in skeletal muscle.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Cold exposure therapies are based on a known and reliable mechanism of BAT activation. Still, despite the high metabolic capacity of active BAT, its overall contribution to total energy expenditure is fairly small in adults. Indeed, even when looking exclusively at cold-induced increases in energy expenditure, BAT activity contributes only a relatively small percentage compared with both shivering and nonshivering activity in skeletal muscle. In other words, the rationale for cold therapies may be valid at a cellular, mechanistic level, but it falls apart when we consider the miniscule impact that cold-induced BAT activation has on whole-body energy expenditure in humans.",
