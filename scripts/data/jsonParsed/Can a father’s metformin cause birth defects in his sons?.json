  "content": "In my rebuttal of a recent paper on the efficacy of statins, I tried to emphasize that one very flawed study does not in any way discredit the importance of constantly reevaluating conventional medical wisdom, especially in response to changing circumstances and information. Only through such questioning can the medical field move forward and adapt to new challenges, but new evidence must be subject to close, discerning examination.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A study concerning a different gold-standard therapy, one which could potentially raise a more credible (albeit still very preliminary) concern: can paternal metformin use cause birth defects in offspring? Metformin is a first-line therapy for glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), a disease which, historically, has almost exclusively affected adults beyond prime reproductive years. But in developed nations, the average age at diagnosis for T2D has fallen precipitously in recent decades, and incidence among younger adults – and even children and adolescents – is on the rise.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In their prospective study of over 1.1 million births in Denmark from 1997-2016, the authors used registry data to determine paternal exposure to three separate diabetes treatments – insulin, metformin, and sulfonylurea – during spermatogenesis (the 3-month period leading up to conception). They analyzed the data for correlations between treatment exposure and birth defects in offspring up to one year post-birth, and they found that paternal metformin treatment – but not treatment with insulin or sulfonylurea – was associated with elevated frequency of genital birth defects in male offspring, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 3.39 (95% CI, 1.82 to 6.30). Additionally, metformin exposure was associated with a higher frequency of all-category birth defects irrespective of offspring sex (aOR: 1.40, CI: 1.08 to 1.82) as well as a lower proportion of male vs. female births (49.3%), contrasting the expected slight male bias.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "As the authors themselves point out, this study is not without significant limitations. Perhaps the largest is the absence of data on medication compliance and glycemic control. Paternal exposure was determined from registry data on filled prescriptions, but filled prescriptions aren’t necessarily taken prescriptions, so we can’t be completely certain that every exposed infant truly was exposed. Another caveat concerns the authors’ findings on sulfonylurea. Both metformin and sulfonylurea were found to have similar associations with all-category birth defects (aORs of 1.40 and 1.34 for metformin and sulfonylurea, respectively) and lower proportions of male births (49.4% and 49.3%, respectively).",

  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "This study has shown an association between paternal metformin exposure and offspring birth defects, but it cannot show a causal pathway linking the two variables because of the “third variable problem” – the possibility that a third, confounding variable affects both paternal metformin exposure and offspring defects, creating the false appearance of a causal relationship between the two. T2D is a complex disease affecting the entire body, and any number of affected pathways might impact offspring health. Having diabetes certainly makes one more likely to take diabetes medications, but this condition also has clear (though not fully understood) links to reproduction: diabetes in men has detrimental effects on fertility, and maternal diabetes has been associated with birth defects in offspring. Additionally, T2D is correlated with many comorbidities (e.g., obesity) for which the study authors did not have data but which may have also contributed to the associations they observed.",
