  "content": "A study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine examined the effects of paternal exposure to three separate diabetes treatments during spermatogenesis on offspring. The study found that paternal metformin treatment was associated with elevated frequency of genital birth defects in male offspring, as well as a higher frequency of all-category birth defects irrespective of offspring sex. These associations were not observed in the offspring of men who ceased metformin treatment prior to the 3-month preconception window, nor did the authors find any effect on unexposed siblings of exposed offspring. The study was robustly designed by observational standards, utilizing vast registry data to exclude cases of maternal diabetes or essential hypertension and to adjust for confounds.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The study has significant limitations, including the absence of data on medication compliance and glycemic control. The study was underpowered, and even a small error in assessing exposure might have made the difference in whether or not the result was significant. The lack of glycemic control data raises the possibility that this variable constituted a major confound for which the authors could not adjust. The study was also underpowered for sulfonylurea, and insufficient power might account for the lack of observed association between paternal sulfonylurea exposure and the specific subclass of genital defects in male offspring.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The study has shown an association between paternal metformin exposure and offspring birth defects, but it cannot show a causal pathway linking the two variables because of the “third variable problem”. T2D is a complex disease affecting the entire body, and any number of affected pathways might impact offspring health. More studies are needed.",
