  "content": "For 2020, he has switch to a 3-day fast once a month. The rationale for the switch was twofold: 1) 7-day fasts are quite intrusive on life 2) In doing the 7-day fasts, Peter has noticed that on the second day of his fasts, his glucose levels will normalize and his ketone levels really start to rise — so something interesting is happening at that point so at least doing a slightly less extreme version (3 days) will give him some of that benefit that we got from the seven day fast",

  "content": "3 days fasts are easier, not just because they are shorter, but he never feels like he’s “dragging” like he does a some points during the 7 day fast. Exercise tolerance is higher since he’s not subjected to the same degree of glycogen depletion. The implications to this is that he won’t have to dial back the volume/intensity of his workouts multiple times per year. Note: Peter still needs to do a full blood test after day 3 to be able to compare it to after day 7. However, he HAS done a blood test after a 4 day fast and here’s what he noticed: It looked almost identical to what he’d see at the end of a 7 day fast, meaning… Insulin is basically unmeasurable, Glucose is very low, Triglycerides, not that low, Likely b/c so much flux of triglyceride to free fatty acid going through, that that’s basically your substrate for making all those ketones",

Potential advantages of having an “accurate” breath test for measuring ketosis: One—Much cheaper Two—More practical and accessible for people (especially since they don’t have to draw blood) And a device like this is probably MORE helpful when trying to get into ketosis by way of a ketogenic diet vs. when fasting, says Peter",

  "context": "Fasting",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "During a fast, Peter says you wouldn’t really want to ingest exogenous ketones Why? Because one thing you are trying to accomplish with a fast is autophagy … and exogenous ketones are a source of energy which would probably impair autophagy from happening 3 things that signal autophagy to happen: Low ATP—low intracellular ATP is a global signal for autophagy and that’s mediated through the upregulation of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) Low mTOR—When amino acids are low, mTOR activity goes down and that becomes a signal to autophagy A reduction in the cytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA—the way that the cell checks for low levels of acetyl-CoA (a metabolite of glucose and fatty acid) is looking at protein de-acetylation. As protein de-acetylation goes down, intracellular acetyl-CoA levels go down, and that’s a trigger for autophagy. *Peter’s concern regarding taking exogenous ketones is that beta-hydroxybutyrate might would trip up one of those three systems and therefore attenuate, or even shut off, autophagy ⇒ More on this in a future podcast with Dr. Eileen White and/or Dom D’Agostino",

  "title": "Effect of exogenous ketones on blood glucose levels",
  "date": "April 21, 2020",
  "context": "Fasting",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "It appears that ingesting ketones actually drives down blood glucose… why does this happen? One potential explanation: Ketones do elicit insulin (That’s how people with a functioning pancreas don’t get diabetic ketoacidosis from nutritional ketosis). So if someone were to take a huge amount of exogenous ketones, it would likely then release insulin which then drives blood glucose levels down. Another possible factor: The body may sense that with a rise of BHB, you have more energy substrate (ATP) so therefore it down regulates your blood glucose. If you plotted glucose and BHB (both in millimole) over the course of a day, they tend to sum to about the same amount no matter the % of the total was BHB or glucose. Now, there’s ways that you can blow that up ⇒ go eat a big Mac and fries and a milkshake your ketones will bottom out at zero but your glucose of course can go up and up and up. BUT… if we’re talking about not eating crap and not taking exogenous ketones even, but rather you’re in nutritional ketosis and watching BHB and blood glucose wax and wane… the two of them add up to about 6-8 millimole.",

  "content": "5 tips to help you get through a multi-day fast [25:55]. Tips: 1 | Start with baby steps, know you can end it whenever you need to. Peter says there’s nothing wrong with ending a fast early if you’re not feeling well. In fact, he has ended fasts for his patients on many occasions. That said, Peter doesn’t have any examples of a patient who “medically” NEEDED to eat. Needing to eat was more psychological than anything. 2 | Fast with others to be able to support each other. The feeling of support while doing it with another person makes the process easier to get through. If you don’t have a person to do it with, consider the fasting app called ZERO. *Note, Peter is involved with this company. At any time, there’s 500,000+ people fasting simultaneously using the Zero app. “There’s a huge strength in numbers that kind of comes from knowing that at any moment you’re miserable. It’s going to pass and you’re not alone.” 3 | Have a plan for when you know it will be tough. If you love a certain food or meal, be somewhere else when that temptation will be there. Go for a walk, occupy yourself elsewhere. 4 | Have something to look forward to.",
