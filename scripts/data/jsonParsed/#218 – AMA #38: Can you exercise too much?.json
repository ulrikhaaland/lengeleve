There was no change in direction. The majority of the benefit came from being in the bottom 25 percentile fitness to being in the 25th to 50th percentile business—as a single quartile jump had the biggest bang for your buck. The take home message here if you’re listening to this and you don’t exercise is, stop listening to the rest of this podcast. Don’t worry about the J-curve.

You would see that the the yellow circles—the unity ones—they have the highest mortality. If you get into that optimal zone, you see a huge reduction. If you go a little bit further into that red zone… Depending on the study, sometimes you go down, sometimes you go flat, but it looks like most of the time, you actually uptick in mortality. In all but one case, you don’t erase the benefits of being optimally active, but you move away from optimally towards inactive in terms of benefits.

It turned out, all but one of the studies included in this analysis actually had the information within the papers to put the error bars on them, but they weren’t there in the original figure.

But if you are most active, it goes up to a 30% reduction, meaning you lose 10%. But when you put the error bars on, it’s not significant. -The next study—Lear. This study suggests that optimally active has a 20% reduction in risk. And most active takes you to about a 65% reduction in risk. That one turns out to be statistically significant. It’s also one of the two curves that says there’s no J-curve. -The Lee study. It hits its natter at about 65% as well. Then it upticks to about 75% but the 95% bars overlap, so it’s not statistically significant. -The next study—Schnohr. This shows a huge reduction in risk when it goes from inactive to optimally active—an 80% reduction in risk. The most active data suggests that the hazard ratio is 1.97, however, it’s not significant. They couldn’t even draw the error bar on this one because it’s so big it would come off the page. -The Paffenberger study. There are no error bars and it shows a J-curve. So, again, we don’t know if it’s statistically significant. -The Wen study. This curve is “L shaped”. But it’s not significant. -The Stewart study. Mortality risk goes straight down as you get more active (meaning no J-curve). But it’s not statistically significant. -The Armstrong study. Shows a J-curve. But also not significant. -The Maessen study. Shows a J-curve. But also not significant.",

When energy expenditure was binned into <500, 500-2000, and >2000 kcal, all-cause mortality decreased with increasing kcal expenditure in all age groups. However, when bin-width was reduced to 500 kcal each, there were more deaths in the > 3500 kcal group, but the group also had much higher man-years than the lower kcal groups. This change in statistics due to cherry-picking bin widths can be misleading, especially if populations from one group far outnumbers other groups.

Other demographic information such as age, sex, education, physical labor at work, smoking, drinking, diabetes, hypertension, and history of cancer. Clinical values of fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and BMI. Activities recorded were light (e.g., walking), moderate (e.g., brisk walking), medium vigorous (e.g. jogging), or high-vigorous (e.g., running). To calculate MET-hrs, MET values of 2.5 for light, 4.5 for moderate, 6.5 for medium-vigorous, or 8.5 for high-vigorous exercise were used as well as the duration per week spent on the different LTPA activities within the previous month.",

Vigorous exercise imparted reduction in all-cause mortality in a shorter duration of exercise than moderate intensity exercise and vigorous exercise has a higher ceiling for risk reduction. Both moderate and vigorous exercise intensities plateau in their conferred benefits, but there is no evidence from this study showing a J-curve or increase in risk at the highest level of exercise. However, the largest volume of exercise reported in this study was 45.2 MET-hr/wk (+/- 15.4).

If you shrunk those error bars, that would at least take the statistical concern off the table. In one case, we don’t know if you can or can’t, which is the Paffenbarger study, in the other, you statistically would exactly say the opposite (the Lear study). In the others they’re not statistically significant at all. But if you shrunk all those error bars to little mini bars, you’d say, wow, that’s significant, but you’re not going to see it on either the size or noisiness of your data set.

Wen and Stewart (not significant), Lear (was statistically significant). Issue #3: Cherry picking data. Lear study, for instance: all cause mortality actually showed no J-curve when all physical activity was combined, both recreational and occupational. J-curve only exists in the all cause mortality when recreation only activity was considered, but it’s worth noting that this was a population that had a very active day job. There might be something there, but you have two different J-curves depending on which you look at. Issue #4: Very small numbers of people in the most active group. Arem paper – 31x times less in the active group vs. the moderate group. Schnohr paper – 16x less in active group. Issue #5: general poor methodology. Strong confounders, incorrect grouping, etc. In the Armstrong paper, for ex: most of the active women also had a higher percentage of smoking and lower socioeconomic status than the less active women – a “reverse healthy user bias”.
