  "content": "Alcohol negatively impacts sleep. It is a sedative and a GABA agonist, which can cause you to lose consciousness more quickly, but this should not be confused with falling asleep. Alcohol fragments sleep, causing you to wake up more times during the night, often so briefly that you don't remember. It also blocks REM sleep, leading to waking up unrefreshed and unrestored. However, it doesn't seem to negatively impact deep sleep.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Even just two drinks can disrupt REM sleep, leading to more wake-ups and more light sleep. The mechanism of sleep disruption is not clear, but it might be due to the aldehydes, a byproduct of ethanol metabolism, which block the brain's ability to generate REM sleep. Alcohol reduces REM sleep, can reduce sleep latency so you can fall asleep quicker, but overall reduces the quality of sleep.",

  "date": "March 29, 2022",
  "context": "Alcohol & Sleep",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Alcohol can impact four biometric parameters: resting heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, and body temperature. The impact is a function of how much you drink and when you drink in relation to sleep. For example, two drinks close to bedtime can increase resting heart rate, compress heart rate variability, increase respiratory rate, and raise body temperature.",
