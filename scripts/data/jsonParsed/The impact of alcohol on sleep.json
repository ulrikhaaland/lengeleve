  "content": "Alcohol is a sedative that can put you to sleep quicker, but it can also fragment sleep and block REM sleep. It can reduce the quality of sleep and negatively impact disease. The mechanism of sleep disruption is speculated to be the aldehydes which is a byproduct of ethanol metabolism. Alcohol-induced reduction in glutamate has also been implicated in alcohol-induced suppression of REM sleep. Overall, alcohol reduces REM sleep and has little effect on deep sleep.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Alcohol can impact resting heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, and body temperature. The impact is a function of how much you drink and when you drink in relation to sleep. For example, two drinks close to bedtime can increase resting heart rate by 6-8 beats per minute, compress heart rate variability by 20-50%, increase respiratory rate by 2 breaths per minute, and increase body temperature by 0.3-0.6 °F.",
