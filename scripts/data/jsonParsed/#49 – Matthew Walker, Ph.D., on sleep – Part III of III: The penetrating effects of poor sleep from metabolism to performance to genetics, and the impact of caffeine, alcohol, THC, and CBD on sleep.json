Anxiety is a major cause of insufficient or poor sleep. If you lower the “fight or flight” response, you get a more parasympathetic state and/or your core temperature drops.",

If there is one gold standard measure of insufficient sleep, it’s not only just your response time, your basic reaction time, but it’s the number of times that you miss a response. This is called a lapse, or an error of omission (You omitted a response that should have been happening). Six hours of sleep for a week can drop your reaction time by as much as 300-400 milliseconds which in F1 racing can be the difference in being first and out of the race completely.",
