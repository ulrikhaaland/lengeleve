  "content": "Review of the literature on THC and CBD. THC is not a good sleep aid for a teenager (because their brain is still developing). THC does make you fall asleep faster (reduces sleep latency), but like alcohol, it blocks REM sleep. With regular use of THC, you start to lose the sleep latency benefit, and if you try to quit using it, many people get “rebound insomnia”. There’s not enough data yet on CBD as a sleep aid, although the data is more promising than THC. Falling asleep faster with CBD. Early tentative preliminary evidence suggests it does not have the same negative impact on REM. Also fewer dependency issues and don’t get insomnia rebound. CBD might also benefit some sleep disorders. Might reduce severity of sleep apnea. Might also help PTSD-related sleep problems. It’s dose dependent, and it’s not clear at this point what the optimal dose is. There may be other doses that are actually detrimental to sleep and we need to stay away from them. So it might that there is a U-curve with a “sweet spot” for dosing with other doses being detrimental to sleep. One hypothesis is that CBD may decrease your core body temperature, leading to better sleep. Another is indirect benefits through its reduction of anxiety, for which evidence is strongest right now. Anxiety is a major cause of insufficient or poor sleep. If you lower the “fight or flight” response, you get a more parasympathetic state and/or your core temperature drops. Peter has seen some anecdotal evidence of impressive results with CBD. Seems to especially work for people with existing sleep issues. For those who sleep well already, CBD doesn’t seem to improve it. And it does not work for everyone. But Peter has seen patients for which medications won’t work for them but CBD oil does, it’s not clear why.",

Sleep deprivation is going to affect margin of error and reaction time, which are essential in racing. If there is one gold standard measure of insufficient sleep, it’s not only just your response time, your basic reaction time, but it’s the number of times that you miss a response. This is called a lapse, or an error of omission (You omitted a response that should have been happening). Six hours of sleep for a week can drop your reaction time by as much as 300-400 milliseconds which in F1 racing can be the difference in being first and out of the race completely. Spatial attention goes down very quickly under conditions of sleep deprivation. When other racers are on the track, it becomes strategic and you have to make multiple decisions in split seconds, and sleep affects critical components of that. It’s incredible how much your judgment can be impaired when others are on the track probably due to sleep’s impact on impatience and impulsivity (can lead to irrational thinking). It’s a physical sport too, and when your physical performance is mismatched to your natural circadian rhythm (like with jet lag) you will not be able to perform your best.",
