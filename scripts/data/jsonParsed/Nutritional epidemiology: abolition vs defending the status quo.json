  "content": "Nutritional epidemiology studies often rely on weak methods, measurements, analyses, and reporting. Four areas of focus to improve the quality of these studies include: (1) Stronger designs, (2) Stronger measurement, (3) Stronger analyses, and (4) Stronger execution and reporting. Randomization is considered the most powerful study design to examine cause-and-effect relationships. Self-reporting from food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) is notoriously inaccurate. Bias due to confounding is a core limitation of observational research. The reporting of observational studies is often inadequate.",

  "content": "Begin with the research question to be answered, consider which measurements would most effectively answer this question, and develop a study design best-suited to delivering these data. Designs exist both for generalizability of results and for making inferences to a specific individual. Before declaring a randomized trial to be impossible, impractical, or unethical, researchers should thoroughly review all available options.",

  "content": "Self-reporting tools should be used in conjunction with additional, objective means of evidence validation, and should be avoided when invalid or unfit for a particular use. Blending varying degrees of automation with traditional, observational studies can improve the quality of self-reported data. Researchers should continually seek additional biomarkers and other new technologies and methods for collecting objective data.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The relationship of dietary factors to numerous potential confounders, such as age, sex, education, and income, should be determined, and uniform standards developed to include and address these. Investigators should use multiple analytical methods, including appropriately robust and sometimes novel statistical tools, to mitigate biases common to simple observational studies. To resolve the complex problem of innumerable interacting variables in the exposome, investigators should seek information technology approaches to the investigation, reduction, and interpretation of data.",

  "content": "Nutritional epidemiology should adhere to reporting guidelines. To prevent selective non-reporting of studies and results, investigators should register research prospectively and report results for all outcomes and analyses. To improve transparency and openness, investigators should share research materials, data, and code. To promote scientifically appropriate interpretations, researchers should avoid “spin” in scientific reports and press releases and identify limitations associated with their findings.",

Editors and reviewers for scientific journals might help to elevate standards by requiring more rigorous methods and public disclosure of data and analytical codes. Perhaps the ultimate gatekeepers must be investigators themselves.",
