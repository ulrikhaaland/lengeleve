  "content": "Self-reporting from food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) is notoriously inaccurate, but the use of FFQs continues to persist in nutritional epidemiology. David and his colleagues note that the FFQ does not accurately estimate frequency of intake or gauge serving size and energy intake from FFQs is invalid. Many FFQs ask you how frequently you’ve eaten particular foods over the course of a year.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Self-reporting tools have utility for some uses; however, when possible, self-report should be used in conjunction with additional, objective means of evidence validation, and should be avoided when invalid or unfit for a particular use. Blending varying degrees of automation with traditional, observational studies can improve the quality of self-reported data. Researchers should continually seek additional biomarkers and other new technologies and methods for collecting objective data.",

  "content": "Bias due to confounding is a core limitation of observational research. Confounding occurs when a factor is associated with both the exposure (or treatment) and the outcome (e.g., disease or death), and is not part of the causal pathway from exposure to outcome. In observational nutritional epidemiology, there are many confounding factors that can distort the results of a study. Using statistical analyses, confounding factors can be adjusted for after data gathering. But confounding can persist, even after adjustment. There are often additional confounding factors that were not considered, or there was no attempt to adjust for them because they were not measured during the process of data gathering.",

  "content": "The relationship of dietary factors to numerous potential confounders, such as age, sex, education, and income, should be determined, and uniform standards developed to include and address these. Investigators should use multiple analytical methods, including appropriately robust and sometimes novel statistical tools, to mitigate biases common to simple observational studies. To resolve the complex problem of innumerable interacting variables in the exposome, investigators should seek information technology approaches to the investigation, reduction, and interpretation of data.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The reporting of observational studies is often inadequate. Two of the biggest issues raised by Allison and colleagues are the multiple hypothesis testing problem and selective non-reporting of studies and results. This multiple hypothesis testing problem often leads to the reporting of nonexistent effects and associations and contributes to the poor reproducibility of many nutritional epidemiology studies.",

One reason for this bias is that investigators often think their (usually null) results are unimportant or uninteresting and therefore never submit them for publication.",

To prevent selective non-reporting of studies and results, investigators should register research prospectively (e.g., on ClinicalTrials.gov) and report results for all outcomes and analyses. To improve transparency and openness, investigators should share research materials, data, and code. To promote scientifically appropriate interpretations, researchers should avoid “spin” in scientific reports and press releases and identify limitations associated with their findings.",
