This suppression of thyroid probably affects up to 40% of women, says Dom. But it’s hard to deconstruct what’s happening because some of them are over-exercising or calorie restricted or taking intermittent fasting a little too often. Dom suggests doing these things intermittently rather than continuously. And your body adapts to that state if you’re doing it all the time, so I believe it’s important to use it intermittently.",

Butyrates are also an epigenetic regulator in the form of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Acetate and propionate also play an important role so that microbiome diversity is key. For Dom, personally, getting some amount of fiber is important. That being said, Dom says some people respond very well clinically to a diet that’s completely devoid of carbohydrates, such as in the case of those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). But generally, he would not recommend to completely eliminate fiber all the time. Having some amount of fiber in the diet promotes microbiome diversity. But it doesn’t necessarily all have to come from plant foods. Some prebiotic fiber is really important long term for gut motility, microbiome diversity, and just for the overall microbiome.",

Creatine has always been a staple for Dom. He takes it upon waking every morning. For Dom, it’s a noticeable effect in terms of his strength levels and also seems to give him a brain boost. Dom says everyone could benefit from about 3 grams of creatine daily. Dom says he does a loading phase of about 10 g per day for a week. This will put on 2 or 3 lbs of body weight. He will also be able to get an extra 2 reps or so on certain lifts.",

  "content": "Kiefer came up with the idea of carb backloading. It basically looks like… Breakfast and lunch is low-carb/keto. Exercise later in the day or the evening, and that’s when you would ramp up the carbohydrates. Kiefer’s rationale: You’re more insulin sensitive in the morning and a little more insulin resistant at night (just general circadian rhythm). Therefore, you may be more susceptible to storing your energy as fat when you’re more insulin sensitive in the morning. So you basically ride out the overnight fast, which increases fat oxidation, keep carbs at a minimum. Then you train and exercise and eat the carbs right after your exercise. The thought is that after a hard workout you’d partition more glucose to the muscles and less to fat, in part because of the non-insulin mediated glucose uptake, and in part because the fat cells may be a little more insulin resistant at night. Furthermore, the carbs Kiefer suggested eating were higher glycemic (e.g., cherry turnovers) which would spike insulin and spike the growth after a workout.",

Dom thinks it could work really well for ultrarunners. Keto diet promotes many adaptations that can enhance recovery from the crazy workouts. When first starting a ketogenic diet, you’re likely to experience a negative hit to your physiological, cognitive, and even immunological performance because it’s a stress to your body.",

It may have an anti catabolic effect—so enhancing lipolysis may be sparing muscle to some extent. Growth hormone is anabolic to some extent…but growth hormone will cause an increase in tissue of all your organs too. Rather, he’s focused on being in an optimal physiological state for training—fully fed the prior day, glycogen is up, and he’s well rested.
