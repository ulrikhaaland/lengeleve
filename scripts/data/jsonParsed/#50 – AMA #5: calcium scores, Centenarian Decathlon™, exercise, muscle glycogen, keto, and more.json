  "content": "A coronary calcium score (CAC) is a CT scan that’s done dry (without any contrast). If you see something really, really bright white, it’s calcium. The amount of calcification is then scored and ranked against a percentile. It is certainly helpful especially in terms of being able to update your probability based on new information. People tend to think if their score is zero then they are at zero risk. Unfortunately, that’s just categorically untrue. A zero score actually means actuarially (at the population level) a lower risk of a coronary event. What is a “coronary event”?  ⇒ A major adverse coronary event (MACE) = heart attack, stroke, or cardiac death. Furthermore, nearly 50% of fatal MIs occur in non-calcified areas of coronary arteries. Those data are also a bit misleading because many of those patients still had calcifications elsewhere.",

  "content": "Atherosclerosis can be present even without a single shred of calcium. It is really a function of your age and gender. The number is not nearly as important as the percentile. It’s where do you stack up against your peers. A calcium score of 6 for a 35 year old puts you in the 75-90th percentile so even though that is a tiny burden of calcium, that’s a significant problem. And a calcium score of 6 for an 80 year old means you have no calcium, even a calcium score of 6 to 10 for a 60 year old would be considered quite low. It has to be taken in the context of age.",

When a patient has a calcium score of something that’s not zero, you put them on a statin. Over time, their calcium score expands (sounds like a negative) ⇒ But provided they’ve been on a statin it seems to be showing plaque stabilization. On the contrary…recently data came out on PCSK9 inhibitors that said the opposite which is that patients on a PCSK9 inhibitor and also on statins saw a reduction in plaque calcification.",

Very interesting case because this is a patient whose lipid levels are not horrible because he’s been medicated for a large part of this period of time. He does not have an elevated Lp(a), but his family history is really significant for cardiovascular disease. His father had his first MI in his 40s. For all intents and purposes, he looks like someone who would have an elevated Lp(a). Yet, he doesn’t which speaks to just the complexity of the disease.",

The more often it is stretched and held for long periods of time in said stretch position, the more you are damaging the electrical architecture of it. That’s why we see a significantly high incidence, almost 10X that of the general population in highly, highly, highly trained athletes for dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation being a common example. The endothelium is much an important part of this that if you’re damaging the endothelium, all other things being equal, you can still increase the risk of damage to the heart.",
