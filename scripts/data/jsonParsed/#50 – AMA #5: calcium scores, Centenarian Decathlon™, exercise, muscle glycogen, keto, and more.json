Over time, it seems that the muscle and the heart can actually use fatty acids more, which can then divert more of the ketones to the brain. Other fascinating findings from their study: 1) The keto-adapted athletes could handle higher levels of VO2 and still maintain a lower RQ where you’re using more oxygen (i.e. burning fat rather than glycogen) 2) Also, “remarkably”, the glycogen replenishment in the low-carb athletes was about the same as the high-carb athletes. How could this be possible? First, glycerol going to the liver to replace the glycogen. Secondly, lactate can be turned into glucose through the Cori cycle ⇒ the lactate can go to the liver and then the liver spits out more glucose.
