VO2 max is a rate ⇒ how much oxygen per unit time can you process going max effort.",

You can still go faster, because you’re starting to use other forms of energy, but this is the limits of your aerobic system. VO2 max does NOT tell you exactly how fast you can run, but it tells you what sort of aerobic engine you have to play with.",

It’s really not that useful, especially for comparing between people. Now comparing within yourself and how you improve, does tell you something, but in that sense it doesn’t matter what you’re dividing by.",

  "content": "Almost every part along this cascade is engineered more or less to what it needs to be. For example, the conventional wisdom is that your lungs are not a limitation, that you can always breathe enough in. There was a big review paper published recently arguing that in some cases the lungs aren’t overbuilt and one of the situations is highly trained endurance athletes. They can be limited by their ability to get enough oxygen in. You can also run into situations where an athlete is so fit, their heart is so strong, it pumps blood past your lungs so quickly that it doesn’t have time to fully stock up on oxygen.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter says he’s always wanted to see this kind of experiment: Take a group of athletes and run them all to max. Then you reduce the FiO2 of the incoming oxygen. Presumably if the lungs aren’t the limitation, you should still see the same absolute delta. This experiment would least start to eliminate one of those variables—which would be FiO2 and capillary exchange—and then you start pointing to some of these other variables.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "It’s interesting when you go to higher altitude and you reduce the amount of oxygen, “funny things happen”. First, you would think what would happen is you can’t get enough oxygen, so you’re going to be go anaerobic sooner, you’re going to produce more lactate. And yet, the opposite happens — something called the lactate paradox. Also, if you try and exercise to exhaustion at lower levels of altitude, you actually give up when your lactate levels are lower than you would at sea level. The picture that makes sense to Alex is that these things are not just about how much oxygen is making it to the muscle.",
