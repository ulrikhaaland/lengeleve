  "content": "There’s a subset of patients with cancers like melanoma and renal cell cancer, which have a high mutagenic burden. These patients might not have enough immune cells to recognize and kill the cancer completely without any prompting, but if you prompt them with a cytokine, like interleukin-2 at a very high dose, that is sufficient for their T cells to go and eradicate the cancer. About 10 to 20% of people with metastatic melanoma or renal cell cancer will respond to that. The next step would be using something called a checkpoint inhibitor—drugs that block the checkpoints on immune cells. It tends to only work in patients that either have specific mutations or patients that, again, have a very high mutagenic burden. The main impediment to this is cost. If every single person has to have their own TIL or adaptive cell therapy regimen created, that could be a $200,000+ to generate. But the reality of it is, when you compare this cost to the cost of cancer therapeutics today, the cost of doing designer-based immunotherapies might actually be less especially when you do it on a quality adjusted life year basis.",

Pancreatic cancer, for instance, we don’t really have a great way to screen for it, and that’s why we use things like diffusion-weighted image MRIs, liquid biopsies, as ways to basically pursue those things. The esophagus, the stomach, and the colon probably represent about 40% of those GI cancers. Liver and intrahepatic, bile duct, and pancreas are probably also about 40%, and those are much harder to screen for. But when you look at organ-specific sites, colon cancer is generally in the top three leading causes of death for both men and women.",

In other words, you’re basically going to eliminate death from atherosclerotic causes. Practically what it means is basically by the time you’re in your late 30s or early 40s, if you have any measure of ApoB that’s even north of the 20th percentile, that should be completely lowered.",

The fourth isoform (e4) is the high risk one. If you’re a e2/e4 it seems to, more or less, be a wash with maybe slight increase in risk. The e3/e4 seems to be associated with about a 2x-3x increase in risk in Alzheimer’s disease. The e4/e4 probably has about an 8x-12x increase in risk.",
