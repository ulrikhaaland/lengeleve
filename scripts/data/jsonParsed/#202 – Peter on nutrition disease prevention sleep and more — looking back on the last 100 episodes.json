  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter is excited about the promise of immunotherapy for cancer. The holy grail of cancer therapy is undoubtedly immunotherapy. Historically speaking, very few people have a cancer where the immune system can automatically recognize it at sufficient force to eradicate it. There are a couple such patients like that, that Steve Rosenberg saw during his training, that basically formed the impetus for his life’s work. But there’s another subset of patients typically with cancers like melanoma and renal cell cancer, which have a high mutagenic burden where they might not have enough immune cells to recognize and kill the cancer completely without any prompting, but if you prompt them with a cytokine, like interleukin-2 at a very high dose, that is sufficient for their T cells to go and eradicate the cancer. The next step would be using something called a checkpoint inhibitor—drugs that block the checkpoints on immune cells. By dropping these checkpoint inhibitors on patients—so things that block either CTLA-4 or PD-1 being the two most well studied of these—we have the same effect. It tends to only work in patients that either have specific mutations or patients that, again, have a very high mutagenic burden. But when you look at the fact that 80% of patients have neoantigens on their cancers that are recognized by their immune system, yet only about 10% respond really well to immunotherapy and/or checkpoint inhibitors, what about those other 70% of people? What this finding gives us hope for is that we may, in fact, be able to use some combination of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, TIL, or adaptive cell therapy where you genetically engineer T cells with that recognition. So, the reason that those patients aren’t having spontaneous remissions or aren’t responding to interleukin-2 or even checkpoint inhibitors is because they probably don’t have enough of those T cells yet. This now becomes just as much a bioengineering problem as it is an immunology problem. You have to be able to recognize those cells (turns out it’s pretty easy to do). Then you now have to be able to expand them in a manner where they still have the longevity necessary to go in and be infused into patients and basically arrest and eradicate their tumors. Peter thinks that in 10 years we’re going to basically be using designer-based immunotherapies to eradicate most solid organ metastatic cancers.",

For perspective, in 2020 there were about 600,000 people in the US that died of cancer. 170,000 of the 600,000 were in the GI system (so mouth to anus). Some of those GI cancers are very difficult to screen for. The esophagus, the stomach, and the colon probably represent about 40% of those GI cancers. Liver and intrahepatic, bile duct, and pancreas are probably also about 40%, and those are much harder to screen for. But when you look at organ-specific sites, colon cancer is generally in the top three leading causes of death for both men and women. Bold and controversial opinion from Peter: “Nobody should ever die from colon cancer.” (same for esophageal and stomach). The reason for that is that the progression from non-cancer to cancer is visible to the naked eye, through the transition of nonmalignant polyp to malignant polyp. *Thought experiment: if you did a colonoscopy on somebody every single day of their life, they would never get colon cancer because, at some point, you would see the polyp, you would remove it while it is non-cancerous, and they would not get cancer. So… how do you turn that thought experiment into a real life idea? You have to ask the question: what is the shortest interval of time for which a person can have a completely normal colonoscopy until they can have a cancer? There’s no clear answer to this question — some case reports that it can happen in as little as six to eight months. Most people would agree that if you had a colonoscopy every one to two years, the likelihood that you could ever develop a colon cancer, while maybe not zero, is so remote that you could effectively take colon cancer off the list of the top 10 reasons why someone dies of cancer.",

While this may not be practical, Peter believes that anyone with a measure of ApoB above the 20th percentile should have it completely lowered by their late 30s or early 40s.

For some people to lower ApoB that much is trivial — Peter takes a PCSK9 inhibitor and a statin and he can basically eradicate it. But for some people, statins are difficult to tolerate. If they’re a hyper absorber we would use ezetimibe, if they’re a hyper synthesizer, but can’t respond to statins, we use mefenamic acid.",

So comparing someone with end-stage renal disease to someone who doesn’t have it, a smoker to a non-smoker, someone with type two diabetes to someone who does not, those thing above are all big multipliers of risk. But they’re dwarfed by the multiplier in risk that you would go from having a very high VO2 max to a low VO2 max. Note: These associations have lots of interplay with other variables—There’s some genetic component to this, there’s obviously a healthy user bias, etc. But the point here is if you can get yourself to exercise versus not, that’s a big driver of mortality reduction. And the VO2 max becomes one way that we can track the progress you’re making on that metric. Similarly with strength, similarly with muscle mass, and things like that.",

  "content": "Pirelli has been the tire manufacturer in F1 for about six years now. Sometimes, different tire manufacturers are used in the same year. Pirelli has seven tire options, two for wet weather. For each race, they designate a soft, medium, and a hard tire. The five tire compounds are C1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in increasing hardness. If you look at the tire rim, you'll know it's a soft tire because it's red. The medium for that race is the yellow, and the hard is the white. Then the “intermediate” is a green tire with an intermediate tread.",
