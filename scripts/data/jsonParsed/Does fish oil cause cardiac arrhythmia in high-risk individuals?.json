  "content": "Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3FA), found almost exclusively in seafood, have been suggested to reduce primary cardiac arrest and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Fish oil supplements, specifically those containing n3FA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have become part of the preventative treatment repertoire. Current lipid society guidelines recommend EPA for reducing residual risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in high-risk, statin-treated patients with triglyceride (TG) elevations, while other organizational guidelines have continuously recommended intake of n3FA through diet. n3FA intake through supplementation has largely been considered a safe alternative to dietary n3FA consumption.",

  "date": "November 7, 2021",
  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Despite the promise shown by early studies, other reports have called into question the efficacy of n3FA in reducing risk of CVD. Early hypotheses about the cardioprotective effects of fish oil postulated that the reduced risk of CVD events might be related to an anti-arrhythmic effect of n3FA, but such speculation was tempered when, in a placebo-controlled study of participants with implanted defibrillators, n3FA did not demonstrate an arrhythmia-suppressive effect and was reported instead to have a pro-arrhythmic effect in some participants.",

  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Much of the debate over the cardiovascular effects of n3FA has focused on its potential association with atrial fibrillation (AFib), a type of arrhythmia originating in the upper chambers of the heart. A recent meta-analysis reported a significant 37% increase in AFib rates among participants taking n3FA compared to those on placebo. The absolute rate of AFib across the 5 studies was 2.65% compared to about 1.94% in placebo-assigned participants.",

  "content": "The molecular mechanisms through which n3FA exerts various effects on the cardiovascular system are not precisely known, in part because these molecules affect a wide array of molecular pathways. Omega-3 fatty acids influence cellular functions in many different types of tissues by modulating gene expression and interacting with cellular receptors, ion channels, and enzymes, as well as by incorporating into cell membranes and altering their structural properties. For the heart, the net result of these n3FA cellular actions is potentially alteration of cardiac electrical activity and modulation of processes like vasodilation, vasoconstriction, and platelet aggregation.",

  "date": "November 7, 2021",
  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "An additional source of individual variation in CV outcomes of n3FA therapy comes from variability in vagal tone. As noted earlier, the cardiovascular effects of n3FA are consistent with a heightening of vagal activity, characterized by a decrease in heart rate and increase in HRV. Though these effects are desirable in most cases, they are associated with an increased risk of AFib among individuals with high vagal tone at baseline, such as certain highly-trained athletes. In other words, n3FA may – through the same mechanism of increasing vagal tone – result in reduced AFib risk in some and increased AFib risk in others.",

  "date": "November 7, 2021",
  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "An association between supplemental n3FA and increased risk of AFib seems likely to exist, but perhaps only for those already at significant risk for cardiovascular events. All patients who are advised to take supplemental or prescription n3FA products should also be advised of the potential risks, and caution is warranted particularly for those with a predisposition to AFib. Given the existing evidence that n3FA supplementation may alternatively reduce CVD-associated risk, individual characteristics like heart rate, HRV, TG, and CVD history are important considerations to assess whether n3FA supplementation provides more harm or benefit.",
