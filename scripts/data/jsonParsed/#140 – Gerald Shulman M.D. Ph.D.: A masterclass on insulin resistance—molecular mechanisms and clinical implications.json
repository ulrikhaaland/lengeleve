Prior to this, work pioneered by Philip Randle led to the belief that fatty acid accumulation would lead to an increase in citrate from the citric acid cycle, resulting in inhibition of glucose metabolism through the key glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (a.k.a., the Randle Cycle). Given that the Randle Cycle is focused on fat oxidation rather than glucose transport, it would be expected for glucose and glucose 6-phosphate concentrations in the cell to increase, but Gerald’s team consistently found the opposite–both concentrations to decrease, consistent with glucose transport being the root of the problem rather than inhibition of glycolysis. Gerald’s team conducted a series of studies (Nowotny et al., 2013, Szendroedi et al., 2014) The studies ended up confirming in human muscle biopsies that lipid infusion impaires glucose transport and does so through the lipid intermediate diacylglycerol, which is basically a triglyceride minus one of its three fatty acids.",

PKCε interferes with insulin signaling by phosphorylating a specific spot on the insulin receptor. By phosphorylating a nearby threonine molecule, PKCε prevents phosphorylation of the three previously mentioned tyrosines, thereby preventing subsequent insulin signaling. Gerald’s team created genetically altered mice in which threonine is replaced with alanine at the location of the insulin receptor that PKCε phosphorylates, basically preventing PKCε from phosphorylating it.

Based on these factors, Gerald considers insulin resistance to be an important component of evolution that allows survival during starvation by sparing glucose for the central nervous system.

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Regulation of gluconeogenesis is important in both directions. For example, if gluconeogenesis was not suppressed after eating, blood glucose could go up to 400 or 500 mg/dL. As previously mentioned and shown in Figure 9, insulin signaling leads to phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO proteins leading to downregulation of gluconeogenesis. This regulation, however, occurs through genetic expression, and since changes in genetic expression do not happen fast enough to explain the possibility of turning gluconeogenesis off within minutes, there must be another regulatory mechanism with a stronger influence. Further supporting this, gluconeogenesis can still be shut off when insulin signaling is blocked. And in liver samples from diabetics undergoing bariatric surgery, in which upregulation of the key gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) would be expected due to insulin resistance (Samuel et al., 2009), such upregulation is not found, indicating suppression through a different mechanism. Glycerol, which is a byproduct of lipolysis (breakdown of fat), interestingly feeds gluconeogenesis in an unregulated manner, which is related to Gerald’s team discovering that metformin decreases gluconeogenesis by inhibiting conversion of glycerol to glucose (Madiraju et al., 2014; Madiraju et al, 2018). Related to glycerol and lipolysis, β-oxidation of fatty acids leads to production of acetyl-CoA, which feeds the citric acid cycle for energy production. Acetyl-CoA is difficult to measure, but Gerald and his team developed a method to measure it reliable, and as shown in Figure 15, they consistently find that increases in acetyl-CoA track with increases in gluconeogenesis. This is consistent with acetyl-CoA being known to allosterically increase activity of the gluconeogenic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase. Gerald also consistently sees insulin suppressing acetyl-CoA, which represents a mechanisms through which insulin can more acutely inhibit gluconeogenesis. Insulin strongly inhibits lipolysis in fat cells, thereby decreasing the amount of fatty acids available to the liver to be oxidized into acetyl-CoA and, in turn, decreasing gluconeogenesis. And given the decrease in lipolysis, there is also less glycerol to fuel gluconeogenesis. This is going to answer Peter’s question about how we distinguish insulin promoting storage as glycogen, yet keeping gluconeogenesis going for the brain: Insulin binds the receptor and it has direct effects through the receptor—that is mostly to promote glucose uptake and storage as glycogen. The effects on gluconeogenesis (the process that keeps us going during starvation) is really mostly regulated not through the receptor in liver, but through its effect on the fat cell in the periphery. It’s really insulin putting the break on peripheral lipolysis, less fatty acid delivery to liver, less generation Acetyl-CoA.",

  "context": "Insulin Resistance",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) contribute to insulin resistance. Although much of Gerald’s work shows that diacylglycerol induces insulin resistance independently of inflammation, inflammation is a compounding factor. The transition from insulin resistance in muscle in liver to fasting hyperglycemia requires inflammation. In the context of obesity and diabetes, inflammation causes insulin resistance in fat cells, which results in increased lipolysis, leading to greater delivery of fatty acids to the liver, more accumulation of diacylglycerol and, in turn, more hepatic insulin resistance and less storage of glucose as liver glycogen. In addition, the increased lipolysis leads to increased glycerol and acetyl-CoA, leading to the increased gluconeogenesis driving hyperglycemia. Despite this role of inflammation, diacylglycerol has an active role as well in inducing insulin resistance in fat cells.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "If you do careful studies measuring rates of lipolysis, by definition they will have insulin resistance in the fat cell. They’re holding on to fat because it’s at hyperinsulinemia—their insulin concentrations are two to three fold. But if you brought them down to normal levels of insulin, then you might see more lipolysis. So, there is peripheral insulin resistance. But we’re finding actually the same mechanism that we have in liver and muscle—the diacylglycerol Epsilon pathway is also accounting for this defect and insulin action in the fat cell.",

  "title": "The Negative Effects of Visceral Fat",

  "context": "Insulin Resistance",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In contrast to subcutaneous fat, which is fat just beneath the skin, visceral fat surrounds internal organs including the kidneys, liver, and spleen. Visceral fat is a well-known indicator of poor health and it is strongly correlated with insulin resistance and liver fat (whereas subcutaneous fat is not). Gerald believes that the negative effects of visceral fat are mediated through increased delivery of fatty acids to the liver. In other words, fat accumulation in the liver is the main problem, and visceral fat exacerbates it. This is supported by lipodystrophy, which is a type of disorder in which someone is unable to store subcutaneous or visceral fat. Despite this, people with these disorders have a lot of liver fat and are diabetic, showing that metabolic dysfunction can certainly occur independently of visceral fat. In general, Gerald believes that it is diacylglycerol that initially drives insulin resistance and subsequent increases in acetyl-CoA and gluconeogenesis that facilitate transition to fasting hyperglycemia and diabetes.",

He believes that the liver is the most important organ to target in resolving metabolic disease and that the problem is primarily an energy imbalance (thermodynamics).",

  "content": "Gerald has found glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists to be effective for helping people eat less and lose weight, but they cause nausea in some people. His experience has been that GLP-1 agonists decrease liver fat, but do not completely normalize it. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors also decrease net energy intake by increasing urinary excretion of glucose, and although this may be helpful in combination with other treatments, it has minimal effect on liver fat. The pharmaceutical approach Gerald is most excited about is intentionally inducing mitochondrial inefficiency through uncoupling, which for the liver means more oxidation of fat to produce the same amount of energy.",

This gradient drives ATP synthase, resulting in energy production. Uncoupling dissipates the gradient by allowing protons to pass through the inner membrane without ATP production, thereby requiring a greater input of electrons (which are mainly obtained through the food we eat) to the electron transport chain to produce the same amount of energy.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Mitochondrial uncoupling was accidentally discovered in the early 1900s because of munition factory workers who were losing weight despite not eating differently. The weight loss was eventually determined to be a result of exposure to dinitrophenol, which is a substance that was used in the factories and also happens to be a mitochondrial uncoupler. In 1933, a paper was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by Maurice Tainter describing the use of dinitrophenol for treatment of obesity. Eventually, after creation of the FDA, dinitrophenol was pulled from the market because high doses were causing hyperthermia, and even death in some cases. Hyperthermia is a result of uncoupling (and the subsequent heat generation) occurring throughout all organs of the body. Gerald’s team has addressed this concern by using an uncoupler that only targets the liver.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Metformin effectively lowers glucose levels in people with poorly controlled diabetes, primarily through inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Many people believe that metformin works by inhibiting complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, but Gerald is convinced there is a more important and relevant mechanism. Gerald’s team has found that at clinically relevant concentrations, metformin inhibits the mitochondrial isoform of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Madiraju et al., 2014), thereby decreasing glycerol availability. They have also determined that metformin primarily inhibits gluconeogenesis by limiting the use of glycerol and lactate as substrates (Madiraju et al., 2018). More specifically, conversion of lactate to pyruvate and glycerol to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) are the two steps of gluconeogenesis that metformin inhibits by inhibiting glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This is why metformin rarely causes hypoglycemia – because other substrates, such as alanine, are still available for gluconeogenesis. It is also why lactic acidosis is a known side effect of metformin. Gerald’s team is currently investigating the mechanism of how metformin inhibits glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which Gerald believes to be indirect and hopes to publish within the next year.",
