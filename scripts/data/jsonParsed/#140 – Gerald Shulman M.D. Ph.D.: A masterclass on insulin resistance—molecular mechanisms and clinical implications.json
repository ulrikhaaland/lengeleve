NMR can locate certain atoms based on the spin properties of their nuclei and how they align in a magnetic field.

The first is that the liver produces more glucose through gluconeogenesis, which involves conversion of metabolites like amino acids and lactate into glucose. The second is that less glucose is being taken up by muscle. So overall, production is up and clearance is down. Another contributing factor is that in some diabetics, insulin is low because of impaired production from pancreatic beta cells, which contributes to the lower amount of glucose uptake by muscle and other tissues.",

Given that this is focused on fat oxidation rather than glucose transport, it would be expected for glucose and glucose 6-phosphate concentrations in the cell to increase, but consistently found the opposite–both concentrations to decrease, consistent with glucose transport being the root of the problem rather than inhibition of glycolysis.",

PKCε inhibits insulin signaling at the insulin receptor while PKCθ inhibits signaling somewhere between the receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), ultimately resulting in decreased PI3K activity and decreased translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell membrane. Mice that are altered to not genetically express PKCθ are protected from lipid-induced insulin resistance. Similarly, limitation of fat transport into muscle cells by preventing genetic expression of a fatty acid transporter also protects mice from lipid-induced insulin resistance. In contrast, increasing the genetic expression of lipoprotein lipase, which increases concentration of diacylglycerol in muscle, making the mice more susceptible to lipid-induced insulin resistance. And causing impairment of mitochondrial fat oxidation promotes fat accumulation in the liver of mice and increased susceptibility to insulin resistance, but increasing mitochondrial fat oxidation is protective.",

This implies that the insulin resistant individuals were remaining “healthy” by producing more insulin. Compared to plasma insulin levels, insulin levels in the are about threefold higher in portal circulation, meaning that the liver is being exposed to very high concentrations of insulin. Insulin resistance in muscle leads to de novo lipogenesis and fat accumulation in the liver, leading to increased very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) production by the liver, increased blood triglyceride levels, and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.",

A molecular understanding of how that insulin resistance in muscle happens—which is lipid diacylglycerols block leading to activation of a novel epsilon isoform of protein kinase C (PKCε) which is blocking insulin signaling. Muscle insulin resistance leads to peripheral IR, then hepatic IR, and hepatic consequences which then basically amplifies it. When you get both muscle and liver insulin resistance, and increased glucose production by liver, then something happens to the beta cell and that’s when things really start to spiral where you have very profound hyperglycemia—fasting and postprandial.",

Outcomes of this signaling in the liver include increased glycogen synthesis (through activation of glycogen synthase) and decreased gluconeogenesis (through phosphorylation and inactivation of a FOXO protein).",

In a study on rats, fat accumulation and insulin resistance in the liver through high-fat feeding and found activation of PKCε and its subsequent binding to the insulin receptor to be what caused the insulin resistance. PKCε interferes with insulin signaling by phosphorylating a specific spot on the insulin receptor. The catalytic site of the insulin receptor is normally like a closed loop. In this loop, there are three key tyrosine molecules. When insulin binds to the receptor, these three tyrosines become phosphorylated, physically opening the “loop” and allowing insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) to enter and initiate insulin signaling.",

This protected the mice from hepatic insulin resistance during high-fat feeding. The high-fat feeding used in these studies was mainly just fat, but adding sucrose would have promoted fat accumulation and insulin resistance to an even greater extent. It was discovered that it is primarily just one stereoisomer of diacylglycerol (sn-1,2) in the cell plasma membrane that activates PKCε.",
