Loading the muscles and therefore transmitting that load to bones can offset some of that.

Calcium, about 1000 to 1200 milligrams daily, vitamin D, 800 to 1000 IU daily, and magnesium, 300 to 500 milligrams daily, can be supplemented if you can’t get this sufficiently in food or through sunlight in the case of vitamin D. Calcium carbonate and calcium citrate are reasonable options for supplementing calcium. On the magnesium side, it really depends on what your gut can tolerate. Magnesium citrate, glycinate, and oxide are fantastic if you’re looking for a little speed up of the bowel. If you aren’t, you want magnesium carbonate. Peter likes to mix them up by supplementing with mag carbonate in the mornings, mag oxide at night, and also use a bit of mag glycinate with L-threonate as well. He’s routinely hitting about a gram of magnesium supplementally. It’s pretty hard to get 500 grams predictably of absorbed magnesium every single day, and that’s a real minimum — a gram is really where you want to be. Calcium’s a bit easier to get if you consume dairy, but a lot of plant-based people aren’t going to eat dairy so they have to look to other things.",

  "content": "Drugs are typically last line of defense (and Peter would will refer people out of his practice for this as he’s not enough of an expert). There’s three big classes: 1 – Bisphosphonates – this is the main class of drug for this purpose. 2 – monoclonal antibodies. 3 – synthetic parathyroid hormone. Bisphosphonates increase BMD by about four to 6% in the critical areas that matter, the femoral, neck, the hip, the lumbar spine, and they reduce the risk of fractures. The other two classes of drugs, monoclonal antibodies and synthetic parathyroid hormone, also show efficacy.",

  "content": "Disuse osteopenia occurs when bones are chronically unloaded, leading to high bone resorption and low bone formation. This can be seen in extreme cases such as astronauts returning from space. For most people, this is relevant during bedrest due to injuries or pregnancy. Bone loss due to disuse osteopenia is incremental and progressive, occurring more rapidly in trabecular bone than in cortical bone. To combat this, any form of PT that can actively load muscles is recommended, including cyclic blood flow restriction training (BFR).",

  "content": "A study on immobilized mice found that bisphosphonate treatment inhibited osteoclastic bone resorption and prevented bone loss due to immobility. The treated mice showed no significant difference in bone health compared to control mice. While it is unclear if this will be true in humans, this type of research is important for combating immobility, especially in aging populations.",
