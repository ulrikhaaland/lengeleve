Bone mineral density, how it’s measured, how it changes over the course of life, and the variability between sexes largely due to changes in estrogen levels are all crucial aspects of bone health. There are ways that one can improve bone health, from exercise to nutrition supplements to drugs. It's also important to understand what happens when one may be forced to be sedentary (e.g., bedrest) and how you can work to minimize the damage during these periods.",
