  "content": "In a study, young men were prescribed daily exercise to the tune of > 1,500 kcal expended, and were instructed to slightly restrict the number of kcal/d compared to how much they were eating at a weight-stable baseline. On average, participants were facing an estimated daily energy deficit of over 2,000 kcal/d. These guys were in an “energy deficit” and yet many of them maintained (or even gained) LBM.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "What happens to LBM during a water-only fast? In particular, what happens to skeletal muscle mass? Can you maintain muscle while fasting? Eating a meal that contains protein with high quantities of all of the essential amino acids, leucine in particular, is a great way to stimulate MPS (and reduce MPB). If you’re fasting, this important contributor of MPS, and attenuator of MPB, appears to be out of play. Another way to stimulate MPS is by exercising (resistance training in particular, but also aerobic exercise, perhaps to a lesser degree). However, this also stimulates MPB. Fasting increases the production of ketones, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) in particular, and this may spare the body’s protein from oxidation. During fasting, insulin and glucose plummet while counter-regulatory hormones increase (e.g., growth hormone, adrenaline), setting up a milieu that favors fat-oxidation and enhanced autophagy. While protein breakdown exceeds protein synthesis during a week-long fast, this does not necessarily mean that MPB exceeds MPS.",

  "context": "Fasting",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The mechanical stress from resistance training can turn up mTOR (mTORC1, to be more specific) locally (i.e., in muscle cells), independent of growth factors and amino acids. This may help partition some of the amino acids in the body that are broken down toward muscle, thus preserving muscle mass.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Obviously, the longer you fast, the more you drain your internal sources of food, and the more likely MPB will exceed MPS over time. If you want to ADD muscle mass to your frame, fasting is obviously not the best strategy. But in the short-term (at least up to a week for most people), I believe you can maintain muscle mass while fasting, particularly if you’re resistance training.",
