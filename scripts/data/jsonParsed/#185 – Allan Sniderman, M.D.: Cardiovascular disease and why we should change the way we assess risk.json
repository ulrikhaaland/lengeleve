One must understand the natural history of the disease to learn how to construct a strategy to prevent it. Although much of the work has been on apoB, the more important part has been on understanding how the natural history of atherosclerosis should direct a prevention strategy. Every major guideline in the world bases their selection of subjects for statin prevention on the ten-year risk of disease. But it fundamentally makes prevention of premature disease almost impossible.",

  "content": "When one plugs in the numbers to calculate a patient’s risk for any of the risk algorithms, one expects the output to be the patient’s risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but it isn’t. The calculation is driven by the age and sex of the patient. Things like cholesterol and blood pressure contribute minimally to the actual calculation of ten-year risk. So if the patient is 35, there isn’t a risk calculator for them. If the patient is 40, everyone’s risk is low at age 40. It isn’t until age 55 or 60 that the risk gets over the threshold for the American Prevention Guideline treatment. So prevention really starts at 55 to 60, but almost half of all infarcts and strokes occur before the age of 60.",

Cholesterol and triglycerides cannot be transported because they don’t mix with water, they’re not soluble. Fats have to be put in particles like soap bubbles, there are a variety of different particles. All are considered lipoproteins. Lipoproteins transport fats and cholesterol in the blood.",

When a doctor explains to a patient they have a lot of bad cholesterol, they get it. When a doctor reviews how well a patient is doing on statins, if their triglycerides were high to begin with, they are unlikely to normalize; HDL is unlikely to normalize. If their apoB is good, they’re good. ApoB is Allan’s target of therapy because it’s the total number of atherogenic particles.",

This allows the study of information on somebody that’s fixed at birth to answer the question, is that associated with a difference in outcome?

Hypertension is having higher blood pressure than what is normal. The drugs prescribed to treat hypertension work. Allan thinks hypertension arises from the loss of elastins in the proximal aorta, and that causes systolic hypertension. With hypertension there is a driving force to push particles into the wall. With hypertension, the wall thickens up and it gets harder for particles to go through. The response of the wall changes, and this leads to the increase in blood pressure.",
