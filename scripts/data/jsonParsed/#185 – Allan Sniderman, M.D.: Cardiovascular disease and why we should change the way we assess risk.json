This episode will walk you through the journey of what apoB is and why it is a superior metric for predicting risk of atherosclerosis relative to the far more commonly used metric, LDL cholesterol. And the metric that is better than LDL cholesterol, but still inferior to apoB, which is non-HDL cholesterol. This episode will get into some of the interesting exceptions, i. e., disease states where not knowing apoB poses an enormous blind spot. Although much of Allan’s work has been on apoB, the more important part has been on understanding how the natural history of atherosclerosis should direct a prevention strategy.",

Secondly, the disease gets a foothold in the artery for the first three decades or so of life, but it’s only in the fourth decade that one starts to develop the lesions that can actually precipitate a clinical event. So by the time a doctor tries to prevent an event, the disease is well advanced in the arteries.",

Looking at their coronary arteries, one realizes they already have atherosclerosis; they have oxidized apoB-bearing particles engulfed by macrophages and thickened intima. Much of statin prevention therapy is to prevent complication of disease not actually prevent disease. Statins lower apoB particle number; that’s how they work.

Fats have to be put in particles like soap bubbles, there are a variety of different particles. All are considered lipoproteins. Lipoproteins transport fats and cholesterol in the blood. The outside (or shell) of the lipoprotein is hydrophilic and contains proteins (apolipoproteins), phospholipids, and cholesterol. There are a few large particles that carry fat and cholesterol from the intestine; they’re called chylomicrons. These particles have a protein called apoB-48 on the outside surface.

The pathophysiology of remnant type III, of how a person can have high cholesterol, low apoB, and high triglycerides. In normal metabolism as the VLDL particles get broken down sequentially as a triglyceride is removed and they get converted to LDL particles, as shown in the figure below. In remnant type III hyperlipoproteinemia this process breaks down for reasons that are not well understood. From the age of 30, 35, or 40 people develop high triglycerides and high cholesterol because the VLDL particles aren’t being broken down to LDL particles. This process stalls and VLDL particles circulate a long time in the blood. While they’re circulating, cholesterol gets deposited into them and they become very, very cholesterol rich. These people have a very high risk of coronary disease, peripheral vascular disease. This syndrome is more common than familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), the one that gets all the press. Remnant type III hyperlipoproteinemia is much easier to treat than FH. Remnant type III hyperlipoproteinemia cannot be diagnosed in the US because apoB is not measured.

The literature on hypertension focuses on peripheral arterial tone and complex metabolic studies in sophisticated animal models, as well as some renal studies. Allan suggests looking at factors like cardiac output again (which used to be studied way back when) or factors that alter the behavior of the proximal aorta. He believes these are much more likely to be involved. With hypertension there is a driving force to push particles into the wall. With hypertension, the wall thickens up and it gets harder for particles to go through. The response of the wall changes, and this leads to the increase in blood pressure.

All American men by age 60 are at high risk according to current guidelines; women are five to 10 years later. At age 60 the CAC test isn’t helpful. In most people arteries become substantially transformed in bad ways by age 60. But in people younger than 60, this can give extra information that is helpful, should the doctor be on the cusp of treatment. This test would be for the patient who wants more information to help them decide about intervention. 2) There is a problem with the corollary, if the coronary calcium is negative concluding that the patient is okay. From Allan’s interpretation of the literature, coronary calcification is associated with advanced disease. If a patient has high apoB, the fact that their coronary calcium is negative doesn’t mean they don’t have a lot of disease and that the disease isn’t developing at a rapid rate; it could be there. There’s an argument saying, if the coronary calcium is negative, nothing’s going to happen to in the next five or 10 years. Maybe this is true; but the disease is developing and doctors can’t make the disease go away. Doctors can modify the effects of the disease, modify the consequences. For a patient who has been treated and their LDL, cholesterol, and apoB levels are brought low, remember that they still have an artery that is destroyed; they’re going to have a substantial number of events.",

Allan agrees that he wouldn't use a negative coronary calcium to change his clinical decision for patients who have high apoB or another cause of vascular disease present. He thinks CAC is a good test, but has relatively limited utility for him. On the flip side of things, a young patient who has a positive calcium score is a 4-alarm fire, and treating this patient is a no-brainer. Regardless of apoB, for a patient under 50 who has a speck of calcium in their coronary arteries, that’s utterly unacceptable.",
