Sodium depletion can occur, but if you’re otherwise healthy, your kidneys should be able to reabsorb all the sodium it needs. Magnesium depletion is more common, especially in type two diabetics, and magnesium supplements are often recommended. For dizziness, bone broth, which contains calories and amino acids, can help.",

Even seasoned fasters still get hungry, but it’s never a feeling of hunger that is more profound than a regular day feeling “really hungry”. It’s the anticipation of the hunger that becomes problematic.",

It's important to note that the body should store food energy as glycogen and body fat, but the minute you need to use it, you start burning muscle.",

  "content": "There is weak epidemiology suggesting that skipping breakfast will increase your risk of gallstones. However, many people have gallstones, but there doesn't seem to be an increased risk with fasting. The problem is that people who follow a low fat diet seem to run into issues. Your gallbladder uses bile to emulsify fats. Therefore when there’s not fat in your diet the bile just sits around with all this stuff and you get sludge. Then, you start eating a higher fat diet and you are then squeezing it out and you’re getting stones.",
