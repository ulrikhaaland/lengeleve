Sex hormones have to play a role somewhere in there as well because there are women who develop gestational diabetes and their insulin, their diets, they don’t change. The difference is they got pregnant and that’s a difference in sex hormones. Looking at girls and boys at puberty for example… Yet girls who go through puberty have way more fat than boys (who get more muscle).
