  "content": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) caused the deaths of over 100,000 Americans in 2021, the second year in a row that diabetes-related deaths have reached this mark. The numbers have increased from the approximately 87,600 diabetes-attributed deaths in 2019. However, the death toll from diabetes was only a fraction of that from the two leading causes, heart disease (~700,000) and cancer (~600,000). The CDC reports that COVID-19 accounted for 3.5x as many deaths in 2020 as T2D, and mortality associated with accidents or unintentional injury outpaced diabetes mortality by about 2:1. Diabetes was only the 8th-leading cause of death in 2020, ranking just above influenza and pneumonia.",

  "content": "Diseases do not exist in isolation; one condition can influence the risk of developing another, and multiple conditions can exist simultaneously and interact in ways that critically impact mortality risk. The complexity and uncertainty surrounding causes of death and their categorization has resulted in discrepancies for certain diseases between their true impact on mortality and the impact as reported by the CDC.",

  "content": "Patients with T2D have a significantly elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) relative to those without T2D. T2D and its characteristic hyperglycemia can increase the severity, progression, and mortality risk of these other diseases. For example, one cohort study of colon cancer patients found that over a median 9.4-year follow-up, diabetic patients had a 21% increased risk of cancer recurrence and a 42% increased risk of all-cause mortality relative to non-diabetics after correcting for confounding factors, including body mass index (BMI).",

  "content": "The CDC does not report all contributors to death for cases in which multiple diseases are at play due to the difficulty in ascertaining the relative contributions of myriad comorbidities. On a population level, statistical analyses may be employed to shed light on approximate risk ratios associated with other conditions, but even these calculations are fraught with confounding variables and questions about causation.",

  "content": "There is no doubt that T2D is among those diseases for which deaths are drastically underreported. So although 100,000 Americans is a frightening number, we must bear in mind that a much larger impact on mortality lies hidden, and the CDC reports are only the tip of the iceberg.",
