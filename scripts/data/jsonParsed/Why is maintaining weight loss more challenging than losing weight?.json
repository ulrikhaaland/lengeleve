  "content": "David Allison discusses the difficulty of maintaining weight loss compared to losing weight. He suggests that there is no single explanation for this phenomenon and that it can be approached from an evolutionary and biochemical perspective. The thrifty gene hypothesis from James Neel suggests that animals/humans throughout evolutionary history have been on the brink of starvation and did anything they could to preserve energy. However, this idea is simplistic for many reasons, including the fact that BMI has gone up over the centuries. John Speakman suggests that the freedom from predation could be a factor in obesity. As predators, we could walk around and eat ad-lib, and the genes that were being selected for that gave us satiety mechanisms that kept our weight down were no longer under selection. There's not just one factor.",
