He hopes that Eileen would be apart of helping him put that together. With his Fast Mimicking Diet (Prolon), Valter Longo asserts that it’s possible to get most of the benefit without actually having to be fully fasted, but to instead reduce your calories significantly for a period of five days. Maybe he’s right, but we have no idea. We have no idea what the efficacy of that approach is versus a total water only fast for five days. By about seven days into a prolonged fast, you pretty much reach a steady state. Consistent flux of triglyceride into free fatty acid out of the fat cell. Steady state level of beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and glucose, such that basically the sum total of them in millimolar concentrations is about preserved to where you would be non fasting. So it begs the question, if we posit that once you reach that steady state of seven to 10 days, you’re clearly in a fully turned on autophagy state, what’s the switch look like? The jugular question is: When you’re 24 hours or 48 hours or 72 hours into a fast, are you 80% of the way to the benefit or just 20%? Using fasting (as opposed to trying to find some pill you could take) seems like the easier thing to do. The irony?

  "content": "Rapamycin has been studied liberally in everything from yeast, flies, worms, mammals. It uniformly extends life across all those organisms. It’s also a potent inhibitor of mTOR (which would signal autophagy, all things equal). Safety is the reason, says Eileen. It does other things such as suppress the immune system. Although that is dose dependent. In fact, this experiment showed rapamycin is actually immune enhancing when given intermittently. Why isn’t this being more highly promoted and used as an anti-aging molecule?",

The same is true for exercise, says Peter. Most people need to simply do more exercise however it would be very valuable to understand the minimum effective amount. “So both from an exercise perspective and a nutrient deprivation perspective, there’s no more low hanging fruit in terms of minimizing human suffering and understanding how these things work.” —Peter Attia",

  "content": "David Sabatini and Peter have discussed this possibility (although Peter says he won’t do it). But there’s an huge opportunity there because the metabolic response to nutrients is a black box. And there’s probably a multibillion dollar opportunity in decoding the black box. In other words, when we understand exactly what the response is to each different type of nutrient in every different dose and frequency and we can decode that in the way that we can do with so many other biochemical processes, you can do everything. There’s a drug development platform that comes out of that. But Peter is most interested in applying this knowledge into clinical practice with patients. The drug development side is high risk/effort but high reward. But there’s actually very little risk in doing proper studies to find an autophagy signature",

This involves understanding the metabolic role of autophagy, i.e., Why does one cancer need autophagy more than another?",

One patient went through surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and it all failed. Her body was riddled with tumors. She went on a clinical trial for immune checkpoint blockade and all the tumors melted away. In other words, people who don’t respond to the immune checkpoint blockade may respond to the inhibition of autophagy … “so that would be critically important to do”.",

But it’s not that simple… because there are patients with tumors that do have a high mutation burden that don’t respond and we don’t know why. And then we also know there are tumors that have a low mutation burden that do respond. From there, they can ask questions like: How many mutations do you need? When you have a low mutation burden, what can you do to make the immune system see that tumor? Do you need only mutations in the nuclear genome? What about mutations in the mitochondrial genome? Next is to figure out the mechanism of response to immune checkpoint blockade to make cold tumors hot. And that’s essentially what the loss of autophagy is doing by promoting inflammation ⇒ it is taking a tumor that is not killed by T-cells, that does not respond to immune checkpoint blockade, and rendering that tumor responsive.",
