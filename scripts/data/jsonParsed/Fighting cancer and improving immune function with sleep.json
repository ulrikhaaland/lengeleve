  "content": "There is a significant link between sleep and cancer of bowel, prostate, and breast. WHO has classified night shift work as a probable carcinogen. Partial sleep deprivation reduces natural killer cell activity in humans. One night of poor sleep caused a 70% drop in natural killer cell activity. Sleep gets worse as we age, and therefore our immune system gets worse. Sleep and cancer development: Underslept mice had tumors 200% larger than mice who slept normally. Cancer in underslept mice had also metastasized. The mechanism? Macrophage M1 cells downregulated, and M2 cells (which promote tumor growth) upregulated by lack of sleep.",
