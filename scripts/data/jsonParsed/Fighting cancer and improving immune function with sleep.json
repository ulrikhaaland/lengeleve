  "content": "For the development of cancer, a couple things must go wrong: First, a genetic insult. Second, that insult must be missed by immune system (most of the time T cells identify it). There is a significant link between sleep and cancer of bowel, prostate, and breast (3 of top 4 cancers). Causal evidence is so strong that WHO has classified night shift work as a “probable carcinogen”. A UCLA study found that partial sleep deprivation reduces natural killer cell activity in humans. Healthy adults limited to 4 hrs sleep for one night experienced a 70% drop in natural killer cell activity.",

  "content": "Sleep gets worse as we age, and therefore our immune system gets worse. One of the most dramatic changes with age, and the most sizable and robust physiological changes with age that we see, is that your sleep gets worse. And sleep is probably one of the most powerful regulators of your immune system. A lack of sleep bends curve of lifespan very dramatically.",

  "content": "A study using mice by David Gozal at the University of Chicago found that underslept mice had tumors 200% larger than mice who slept normally. Cancer in underslept mice had also metastasized. The mechanism? Macrophage M1 cells downregulated, and M2 cells (which promote tumor growth) upregulated by lack of sleep. In humans, you would have both the M2 cells upregulated as well as a “tsunami” of cortisol impacting the body and driving tumor growth.",

We are careful with chemotherapy, and meticulous in our research into causes of and types of cancer, yet we have almost but no papers on this topic of sleep and cancer.",
