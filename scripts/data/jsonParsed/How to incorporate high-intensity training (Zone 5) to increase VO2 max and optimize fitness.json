  "content": "From a lens of health, the data are unambiguous— VO2 max is highly correlated with longevity. There are not many variables that are more strongly correlated. But the levels don’t have to be that high. Longevity is also highly related with mitochondrial function and metabolic health. High intensity training is important to improve glycolytic capacity. We lose glycolytic capacity as we age and it’s important to stimulate it. For VO2 max, high intensity training, a 4×4 protocol is recommended: 4 minutes of the highest intensity, sustained exercise followed by 4 minutes of recovery. Repeat this 4-6x. Add a warm up and cool down on either end and this will be a little over an hour.",

  "content": "There’s an aging process where we lose mitochondrial function, and there’s a sedentary component where we lose mitochondrial function. Increasing mitochondrial function takes months or years. If you stimulate the glycolytic system 2-3 days you’ll see progress. Add a high intensity interval 2-3 days a week at the end of that Zone 2 training, and you’ll target both energy systems: the oxidative mitochondrial system and the glycolytic energy system.",

  "content": "Is zone 5 training okay to do immediately following zone 2 training? It is okay to do Zone 5 training immediately after Zone 2 training, as it does not blunt the benefit gained from Zone 2 training. However, doing it in the reverse order can trigger hormonal responses and high blood lactate, which inhibits lipolysis. Lactate at the autocrine level decreases the activity of CPT1 and CPT2 (needed for fatty acid transport into the mitochondria for oxidation), thus interfering with the transport of fatty acids.",

  "content": "Often patients will say, “I went out and did a two-hour ride today and it showed me that I spent 45 of those minutes, 45 of those 120 minutes were in Zone 2. So I did 45 minutes at Zone 2”. This is not the same as spending 45 minutes in dedicated Zone 2 training. There is a lot of up and down intensity. The average might be Zone 2, but you’re oscillating between Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 4, all the time.",
