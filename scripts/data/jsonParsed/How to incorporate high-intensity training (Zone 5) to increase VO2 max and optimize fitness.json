  "content": "From a lens of health, the data are unambiguous— VO2 max is highly correlated with longevity. There are not many variables that are more strongly correlated. But the levels don’t have to be that high. The VO2 max required here is 52-53 mL/min/kg. Longevity is also highly related with mitochondrial function and metabolic health. There’s an aging process where we lose mitochondrial function, and there’s a sedentary component where we lose mitochondrial function. High intensity training is important to improve glycolytic capacity. We lose glycolytic capacity as we age and it’s important to stimulate it.",

  "content": "Increasing mitochondrial function takes months or years. Increasing the glycolytic system takes much less time, weeks or months. If you stimulate the glycolytic system 2-3 days you’ll see progress. Add a high intensity interval 2-3 days a week at the end of that Zone 2 training, and you’ll target both energy systems: the oxidative mitochondrial system and the glycolytic energy system.",

  "content": "Is zone 5 training okay to do immediately following zone 2 training? It is okay to do Zone 5 training immediately after Zone 2 training, as long as it’s done at the end, then exercise is over. But don’t do it in the reverse order because this will trigger all these hormonal responses and high blood lactate. We know lactate inhibits lipolysis. So if you have a high interval in the middle or the beginning and you don’t clear lactate very well, lactate interferes with the transport of fatty acids.",
