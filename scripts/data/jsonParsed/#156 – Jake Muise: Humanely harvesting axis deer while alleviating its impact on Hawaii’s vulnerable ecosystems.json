A survey five years ago showed there was 21,000 axis deer on this very, very small island. In the next phase, axis deer are introduced to Maui in the 1960s, but not without controversy. The axis deer population on Maui is still what we consider an “emerging population”—so they’re continuing to grow, but they haven’t reached carrying capacity. This year, it’s estimated that the population of deer on Maui to be about 60,000. But the population will max out at 210,000 deer (unless we’re able to get ahead of that).

There’s a scenario where subsistent hunters play a huge role in what balance looks like, but Jake also doesn’t get to dictate balance on a private landowner’s property. What Jake is able to do is say, “Here’s how many animals you have. Look, we understand what they’re doing as a liability, as a function of dry feed or watersheds or fencing, or like our roadways. . .This is how many animals you have, how many do you want?” The land owners might say, “Let’s try and bring this from 6,000 to 2000 and see what it looks like.” Jake’s team is able to manage them with such precision via these aerial surveys, so they are able to toggle that balance.",

  "content": "Maui Nui pays the rancher a small amount per pound for each animal harvested. In other words, it’s more valuable for them to let you harvest it humanely than for them to just shoot it and leave it sitting there. At balance, the rancher is happy because he has optimal soil health and no runoff, and he’s not losing feed. But he’s also seeing a small amount of additional value from this animal. Many ranchers have reached out for help, but Maui Nui is yet large enough to help them all. Maui Nui needs to grow and hire more harvesters. But also there needs to be more people to eat these animals. In that scenario, Jake believes they will be able to achieve balance by both growing the company, working with all these private landowners, and then having people eat the harvested meat.",

  "content": "True balance is challenging. Molokai is a great example—Everybody on that place is driving 10 miles an hour on the roads. There are so many deer on the road, the risks to hitting a deer is at those densities is profound. Maui you can do 55, 65 miles an hour. The deer due enormous damage to watersheds and sediment. But it doesn’t make sense to eradicate them since they are a good food source. This is a hard conversation too because Hawaii is also the endangered species capital of the world so there’s a very real conversation. “If I was a conservationist, as I would say get rid of all of these invasive species and let’s work to bring back or rehabilitate the endangered species in these same spaces.” Is it even technically feasible to eradicate axis deer from Hawaii if that was desired? No way, they’re too smart. Only able to accomplish that on the Big Island because they were in such low numbers. So there’s no choice but to find balance.",

  "content": "Yes, there’s ecosystems and ecology we have to respect, and every native species has a right to exist in its own place, but there’s also economics and food security. To at least say, “I support the idea that there shouldn’t be deer shit in our watersheds.” There’s nothing more valuable to an isolated landmass and a community trying to be self-sufficient. We’ve donated 50,000 pounds of venison, over a hundred thousand meals through COVID because food banks were empty. “Hawaii’s economy teeters on absolute disaster because we’re so dependent on tourism and when COVID hit and we shut the door, the vast majority of our community was in trouble.” —Jake Muise",

They had to delay the growth of the company by donating all this food but it served the same mission which is you’re feeding people and you’re managing a population.
