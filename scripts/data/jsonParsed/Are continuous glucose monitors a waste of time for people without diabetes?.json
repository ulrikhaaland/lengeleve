  "title": "The Importance of Tracking Blood Glucose in Nondiabetics",

  "content": "Recently, a perspective in JAMA was published on this topic, highlighting the increasing number of start-up companies promoting the use of CGM in nondiabetics, and included some arguments suggesting that CGMs are “a waste of time and money” for this population. The author states that “… aside from anecdotal stories, there’s little evidence that people with normal glucose responses benefit from tracking their blood glucose,” according to the perspective. They also argue that because glucose fluctuations are so small in nondiabetics, a CGM doesn’t provide any meaningful information for them. First, arguing that there’s little evidence that people with normal glucose responses benefit from tracking their blood glucose is putting the cart before the horse. How do you know if someone has normal glucose responses without tracking their glucose first? Using CGM on someone with “normal” glucose as defined by standard measures such as fasting glucose or HbA1c can determine whether they truly do have tight glucose control and how they respond to different challenges, dietary or otherwise. Just because someone’s fasting glucose or HbA1c levels are considered normal doesn’t rule out the possibility that they have high glucose variability, which are large oscillations in blood glucose throughout the day, including episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels don’t necessarily tell us if people are experiencing normal glucose responses. The only way to know if they are is to track their blood glucose.",

  "title": "Inaccuracy of HbA1c as a Predictor of Average Blood Glucose",
  "date": "June 20, 2021",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Over the past three years we have been tracking these metrics closely and found that at least one-third of the time HbA1c is an inaccurate predictor of average blood glucose relative to true average measured by CGM (and this discordance occurs in both directions, meaning sometimes HbA1c overestimates and sometimes it underestimates). Furthermore, we’ve seen how irrelevant morning fasting glucose can be as a predictor of in-depth glucose kinetics, outside of the extremes seen in patients with type 2 diabetes. In other words, in non-diabetics, a fasting morning blood glucose level of 90 vs 95 vs 100 vs 105 mg/dL can have much more to do with the previous night’s dinner, the quality of sleep that evening, or even the speed and suddenness with which they woke up that morning (and the concomitant cortisol surge) than their true health.",

  "title": "High Glucose Variability in Nondiabetics",

  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In 2018, a study in nearly 60 participants found many individuals considered nondiabetic by standard measures showed high glucose variability determined by CGM. Severe glucose variability was present in one-quarter of normoglycemic individuals, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic ranges — defined as values greater than 140 mg/dL — up to 15% of the duration of CGM recordings, suggesting glucose dysregulation is more prevalent than we might think.",

  "title": "Misinterpretation of Study on Glycemic Profiles in Nondiabetics",
  "date": "June 20, 2021",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "But the recent JAMA perspective pointed to a 2019 study that was attempting to create reference ranges for glycemic profiles in more than 150 healthy nondiabetics that found they spent 96% of the time between 70 and 140 mg/dL based on about one week of CGM data, on average. This study was used to support the argument that there is in fact tight glucose control in these individuals, confirming that “normal is normal is normal,” as one of the study’s coauthors put it. A closer look at the findings, however, suggests otherwise. Median time spent with glucose levels above 140 mg/dL was 30 minutes a day and median time spent with glucose levels below 70 mg/dL was 15 minutes a day. Almost one-third of the participants had at least one hypoglycemic event, defined as a glucose level below 54 mg/dL, and almost half had at least one hyperglycemic event, defined as a glucose level above 180 mg/dL.",

  "content": "Higher glucose variability and higher (and more) peak glucose levels are each independently associated with accelerated onset of disease and death, even in nondiabetics. Prospective studies show that higher glucose variability in nondiabetics is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, frailty, cardiovascular death, cancer death, and death from any cause compared to lower glucose variability. Other prospective studies show similar trends for higher compared to lower peak glucose levels and several human experiments demonstrate that high glucose peaks induce endothelial dysfunction in healthy nondiabetic individuals, and higher postprandial glucose levels are also associated with higher carotid intima-media thickness, suggesting higher glucose peaks may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, even in those with normal glucose tolerance.",

  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Glucose control lives on a spectrum, but it conventionally gets lumped into three distinct categories: normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, and diabetes. Progressing from an HbA1c of 4.6% to 5.6% represents estimated average glucose levels climbing from 85 to 114 mg/dL. This should be setting off alarm bells along the way, but I worry that those bells aren’t ringing because it’s not deemed necessary to keep a close eye on blood glucose in someone with normal glucose tolerance. Viewing glucose regulation as abrupt categories like this rather than a spectrum is probably one of the biggest reasons why more than 120 million Americans have diabetes or prediabetes.",

  "content": "Lower is better than higher when it comes to average glucose, glucose variability, and glucose peaks, even in nondiabetics. There’s a lot of evidence suggesting that people with glucose in the normal range can benefit from lowering their numbers. CGM can be useful in nondiabetics to identify areas for improvement. For example, a patient with normal glucose tolerance by standard metrics had an average glucose of 104 mg/dL over two weeks, a standard deviation in his glucose readings of 17 mg/dL, and more than five events per week in which his glucose levels exceeded 140 mg/dL. All three of these metrics are considered normal by conventional standards, but after a four-week intervention that included exercise changes and nutritional modifications his average glucose fell to 84 mg/dL, his glucose variability to 13 mg/dL, and he had zero events exceeding 140 mg/dL.",

  "content": "While there’s little evidence that people with normal glucose responses benefit from tracking their blood glucose, don’t confuse an absence of evidence with evidence of absence. There are examples where the randomized-controlled clinical trial data isn’t there, but we still have a strong reason to believe it’s true. Relatively healthy people who track their glucose responses will fare better in the long run than those who don’t. The reason why tracking glucose responses is beneficial is because we can optimize them and even stave off their decline. If we don’t have any effective interventions, saying we don’t get any benefit from CGMs is like a group of carpenters saying they don’t get any benefit from tape measures.",
