  "content": "Continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, are used even in patients without diabetes. There are arguments suggesting that CGMs are a waste of time and money for nondiabetics, as glucose fluctuations are so small in nondiabetics, a CGM doesn’t provide any meaningful information for them. However, using CGM on someone with normal glucose can determine whether they truly do have tight glucose control and how they respond to different challenges, dietary or otherwise. Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels don’t necessarily tell us if people are experiencing normal glucose responses. The only way to know if they are is to track their blood glucose.",

  "date": "June 20, 2021",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Just because someone’s fasting glucose or HbA1c levels are considered normal doesn’t rule out the possibility that they have high glucose variability, which are large oscillations in blood glucose throughout the day, including episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. A study in nearly 60 participants found many individuals considered nondiabetic by standard measures showed high glucose variability determined by CGM. Severe glucose variability was present in one-quarter of normoglycemic individuals, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic ranges up to 15% of the duration of CGM recordings, suggesting glucose dysregulation is more prevalent than we might think.",

  "date": "June 20, 2021",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Glucose control lives on a spectrum, but it conventionally gets lumped into three distinct categories: normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, and diabetes. Progressing from an HbA1c of 4.6% to 5.6% represents estimated average glucose levels climbing from 85 to 114 mg/dL. This should be setting off alarm bells along the way, but those bells aren’t ringing because it’s not deemed necessary to keep a close eye on blood glucose in someone with normal glucose tolerance. Viewing glucose regulation as abrupt categories like this rather than a spectrum is probably one of the biggest reasons why more than 120 million Americans have diabetes or prediabetes.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Lower is better than higher when it comes to average glucose, glucose variability, and glucose peaks, even in nondiabetics. There’s a lot of evidence suggesting that people with glucose in the normal range can benefit from lowering their numbers. Prospective studies show that higher glucose variability in nondiabetics is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, frailty, cardiovascular death, cancer death, and death from any cause compared to lower glucose variability.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) can be useful in nondiabetics. A patient with normal glucose tolerance by standard metrics began CGM and after about two weeks it revealed an average glucose of 104 mg/dL over that time. After about a four-week intervention that included exercise changes and nutritional modifications his average glucose fell to 84 mg/dL, his glucose variability to 13 mg/dL, and he had zero events exceeding 140 mg/dL. If he can maintain this way of living in the long-run, it’s likely to translate into an improvement in healthspan and reduce his risk of glucose impairment.",
