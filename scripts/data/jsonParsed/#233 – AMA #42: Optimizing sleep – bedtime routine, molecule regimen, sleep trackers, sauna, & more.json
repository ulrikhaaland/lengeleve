  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter personally does sauna 4-6 nights per week before bed basically for two purposes: 1 – He believes there is at least SOME mortality benefit that comes from it 2 – Improving sleep – “empirically the impact this has had on my sleep is insane”. Peter has often wondered if the mortality benefit of sauna is largely attributed to the sleep benefits that come from its use. Peter’s typical routine is 15 minutes and then a cold plunge and then 20 to 25 minutes. By the end of that second stint in the sauna, Peter is quite taxed and there’s a subset of the population for whom that might be a little too taxing. Outside of that, the biggest risk of sauna is probably having accidents in saunas like falling. But like anything else, it comes at an opportunity cost. For instance, Peter’s routine takes him about 1 hour. The question becomes, is there something better you can be doing in that hour for your physical or mental health? Some benefits are “soft” such as maybe it’s an opportunity time to spend with your spouse (Peter and his wife do the sauna together). Improvement of sleep is a tangible way to assess benefit if you fall in the camp of people who sleep is improved by that. Peter says it’s unclear if infrared and dry have the same benefits. It’s a very different mechanism. And they produce a very different feeling if you’re in them. The literature is mostly on dry saunas. The infrared devices relatively inexpensive, relatively small, such that if you live in a tiny apartment, you could still have one. Peter says he still thinks there is a benefit to infrared but it’s going to be much more difficult to quantify by attribution to the literature. For those people who don’t have access, can’t get access, even a warm bath or even a hot shower can still have some of those sleep benefits that it’s worth people testing before they go to bed.",

Why would you take a drug to sleep?’” And I would say if you feel that way, don’t. I don’t think it’s necessary. I mean, I sleep pretty well without those things. I just sleep a lot better with them. I don’t know why, but for some reason, and it’s understandable, I suspect people sort of think this is unnatural. We shouldn’t have to take anything to sleep. But I would argue we don’t necessarily live in a natural world anymore anyway. So I’m kind of looking for any advantage I can get.”\nWhy one should not use drugs to replace good sleep habits:\nSo someone who says, “I’m going to use these drugs but I’m going to short change sleep” is in for a painful surprise\nOnce you’re taking these, you’re committing to eight hours of sleep\nIf you’re going to only sleep 5 hours and you take these, you’re hosed because you’re going to be so drowsy the next day\nDon’t look at these as hacks that you can use to shortchange all of the other stuff that we talk about with respect to hygiene and timing\nThese are truly accretive things that get added on and improve quality",

In these areas, glycine inhibits motor activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.\nGlutamate is the neurotransmitter that excites motor activity during REM\nEndogenous glycine modulates sensitivity to glutamate and exogenous glycine may augment this modulatory action.\nIn taking glycine, the hope is that it’s calming the central nervous system\n\nData:\nThere’s some decent animal data, but a polysomnographic study in humans is more interesting\nThe human study used 3g of glycine and found three things that happened:\n1 – It shortened latency (fall asleep quicker)\n2 – Reduced the latency to slow wave sleep\nImportant because you have a very discreet window in which you’re going to get your slow wave sleep. It occurs early in the evening, early in your sleep\nSo the later you go to bed, the more you’re short changing your deep sleep, your slow wave non REM, and therefore anything that reduces latency to that presumably gives you access to more of it.\n3 – It had no alteration of sleep architecture anywhere else\n\nContraindications:\nPatients who are taking clozapine shouldn’t be taking glycine",

  "content": "Melatonin is probably the single most common sleep supplement out there. How melatonin works: The pineal gland releases melatonin in the dark and melatonin therefore is a signal to the body that it is time to sleep. When we think about how much physiologic melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland, it’s a very small amount (20-100 micrograms). But when people take melatonin over the counter, it’s very hard to find a dose less than 1 milligram, which is 1,000 micrograms. But when you look at certain data, it would suggest that anything over 700 or 800 micrograms orally, tends to impact melatonin receptors in the brain by down regulating them. Peter’s general rule of thumb: If you must take melatonin frequently, which he would NOT encourage, it should be a very low dose (100-200 micrograms).
