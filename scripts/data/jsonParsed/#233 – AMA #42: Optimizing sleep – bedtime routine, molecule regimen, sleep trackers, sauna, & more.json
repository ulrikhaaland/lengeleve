It also discusses sleep wearables, including both the positives and potential negatives of using such trackers.",

  "date": "December 5, 2022",
  "context": "Sleep",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The pre-bedtime routine consists of avoiding alcohol and eating too close to bed time, and using a sauna. Alcohol can reduce the quality of sleep, trading more deep sleep and REM sleep for light sleep, and causing more frequent wake ups. Eating too close to bed can negatively impact sleep quality. Using a sauna before bed can improve sleep quality.",

However, it is important to consider the individual's health, the opportunity cost of time spent in the sauna, and the financial cost of installing a sauna. The benefits need to be weighed against these factors. It is also noted that the literature is mostly on dry saunas, and it is unclear if infrared and dry have the same benefits.",

For instance, he will floss and brush his teeth even before doing the sauna so that once he’s done with that sauna he goes straight to bed. He even goes as far as not going into the bathroom and turning the lights on. And he’s certainly not looking at his computer or phone. That’s probably another part of why this sauna is beneficial for Peter’s sleep — it could simply be that it’s a forced hour of bringing himself down as opposed to working right up until the last minute, brushing teeth, flossing teeth jumping in bed.",

I don’t think it’s necessary. I mean, I sleep pretty well without those things. I just sleep a lot better with them. I don’t know why, but for some reason, and it’s understandable, I suspect people sort of think this is unnatural. We shouldn’t have to take anything to sleep. But I would argue we don’t necessarily live in a natural world anymore anyway. So I’m kind of looking for any advantage I can get.",

Supplements taken sparingly (e.g., for jet lag) include Phosphatidylserine and Melatonin. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brainstem and spinal cord. In these areas, glycine inhibits motor activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Patients who are taking clozapine shouldn’t be taking glycine. Ashwagandha is a milder version of phosphatidylserine. It reduces activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal access and the cortisol release. An active ingredient of Ashwagandha leaves, triethylene glycol, can induce sleep in mice through reducing the NREM sleep onset latency period. During pregnancy and breast-feeding, in patients pre-surgery, in patients with stomach ulcers, autoimmune conditions, in patients on medication to manage diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid disorders, Ashwagandha should not be taken.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Melatonin is probably the single most common sleep supplement out there. But it is not used regularly. How melatonin works: The pineal gland releases melatonin in the dark and melatonin therefore is a signal to the body that it is time to sleep. The increase of melatonin is a very important signal for our body to go to sleep. When we think about how much physiologic melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland, it’s a very small amount (20-100 micrograms). But when people take melatonin over the counter, it’s very hard to find a dose less than 1 milligram, which is 1,000 micrograms. But when you look at certain data, it would suggest that anything over 700 or 800 micrograms orally, tends to impact melatonin receptors in the brain by down regulating them. In other words, when you put so much of the molecule into place, the brain gets sort of desensitized to it and you reduce the receptors. Instead you want to work on ways to naturally create melatonin through light removal in the hours leading up to bed.",

When you take magnesium, it’s doing a bunch of great things in your body, but it’s generally not getting across the blood-brain barrier (so not getting into your brain). So the L-threonate is the transporter to the brain. Approximately 8 years ago, it was found that, in patients with early MCI (mild cognitive impairment), high doses of magnesium L-threonate were improving symptoms. The idea being that magnesium plays an important role in ion channel conductivity, including MDMA receptors, and something about getting more magnesium in the brain was improving neuronal health.",
