  "content": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disease which may present and progress differently depending on the person and the factors contributing to the disease pathology. There is no paint-by-numbers approach to targeted treatment. Researchers in the field are thus motivated to figure out a way to categorize AD in order to guide more individualized approaches to patient care and help anticipate disease trajectory.",

  "content": "A recent study published in Nature proposed a framework for categorizing AD into subtypes. The researchers analyzed a large collection of data (thousands of brain scans) to propose that the varied AD presentations can be organized into 4 distinct subtypes based on a protein called tau. Abnormal tau aggregation in neurons is one of the hallmarks of AD and is widely believed to contribute to disease progression, making it an attractive choice as a potential biomarker for individual variation.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Tau protein buildup is just one of the hallmark indicators of AD diagnosis and progression. For example, another protein called amyloid builds up in the brain of people with AD decades before the first symptom of memory loss begins. Along these lines, some who meet diagnostic criteria for AD have no tau protein pathology at all. Thus, one challenge in focusing on a single biomarker like tau is that doing so doesn’t offer a complete picture of what contributes to the pathology of AD, which involves many inputs that together produce a constellation of disease symptoms.",

  "title": "Identifying Subtypes of Alzheimer’s Disease",
  "date": "January 15, 2022",
  "context": "Cognitive Health & Neurodegenerative Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The study identified 4 subtypes, each having a distinctive pattern of tau buildup and resulting AD symptoms. These subtypes are: Subtype a: tau aggregates in the inner region of the brain (the limbic subtype), such that memory and emotions are impacted but overall cognition is relatively spared; Subtype b: tau buildup occurs first in the back of the brain and then spreads to the frontal region over time (the posterior subtype). There is a slower cognitive decline relative to the other subtypes when it comes to everyday mental skills such as counting backwards, 3-item list recall, or phrase repetition. However, tau build-up in the visual cortex impacts visuospatial processing abilities such as spatial orientation and distinguishing object shapes, contours, distance, and location relative to other objects; Subtype c: the disease onset is younger and there are more tau aggregates overall but relatively less in the hippocampal region (the medial-temporal lobe, or MTL sparing subtype). The subtype is considered “atypical” because memory impairment is initially absent. On the other hand, tau builds up in the rest of the cerebral cortex so people may have greater difficulties with executive function (i.e., the ability to plan and perform an action or complex task); Subtype d: tau buildup favors the left side (“L” temporal subtype) of the brain, which explains why some people may have preserved memory but impaired language ability (since language is typically processed on the left side of the brain).",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "An alternative approach to subtyping AD is based on clinical markers and attributes (such as APOE4, blood lipids, cardiovascular health, body composition, biological sex) and then addresses the individual’s risk based on the markers that he sees. This strategy – using clinical presentation to better predict disease progression – is a more practical way to subtype AD.",

  "content": "Subtyping is helpful in neurodegenerative disease treatment and precision medicine. In the future, we will have a repository of information that includes brain imaging data, genetic signatures composed of multiple disease-associated genes (i.e., polygenic risk scores), and subtyping molecular signatures of regulatory pathways such as those that control inflammation, cerebral spinal fluid, blood lipids, metabolic panels, and more. Understanding the various inputs that lead to a given subtype, in the hope that we might prevent or slow the potential disease course. For example, if we can recognize early signs of factors that interact and lead to early AD onset, we can preventatively treat the precursors before disease symptoms manifest.",

  "content": "The utility of subtyping lies in the extent to which doing so can improve clinical outcomes. Taking into account the variation of a particular disease across individuals affords opportunities to apply nuanced prevention or tailored treatment. Individualized, multidomain interventions based on emerging principles of precision medicine may improve cognition and reduce Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular risk scores in patients at risk for AD dementia. Subtyping, in essence, is a useful shortcut toward individualization. Formal recognition of the heterogeneity of this disease – whether in 4 subtypes or 400 – constitutes an important advance toward tailored care.",
