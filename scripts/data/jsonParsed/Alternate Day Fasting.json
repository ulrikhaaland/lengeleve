  "content": "A study published in Cell Metabolism on alternate day fasting (ADF) got a lot of press attention. This study was a literal ADF, where participants were basically limited to water, coffee, or tea every other day. This study included relatively healthy, non-obese participants. Many of the studies in the literature look at people who have obesity, type 2 diabetes, or a history of metabolic disorders, so this is a rare chance to look at what ADF can do in “healthy” folks. Based on the 6-month cohort, the investigators concluded ADF is safe to practice for several months and improved markers of health in healthy, middle-aged humans. The most striking finding of the entire study is that, of the 30 individuals that started ADF, more than 6-months later, there were zero dropouts. In the 4-week trial, the results were similar. Two dropouts in the control group and just 1 in the ADF group. That’s a 97% compliance rate (29/30) in the ADF group after fasting every other day for just under a month. This study certainly suggests that if ADF is efficacious, if it clearly can improve health, we certainly shouldn’t just dismiss the intervention because we don’t think anyone could do it. In other words, it may be both efficacious (it works) and effective (it can actually be adhered to).",

  "content": "However, after looking over how poor the design is, I’m not comfortable making any strong claim based on this study. The investigators stated that they “do not have access to baseline values of the long-term ADF cohort.” This is comparing differences in “the Lipid Profile” of these two groups at the 6-month (technically, “>6-months”) timepoint. Not having access to your baseline values is another way of saying you don’t know where you started. If the investigators of the study don’t have access to baseline values in the >6-month ADF cohort, how can they say they’re comparing apples to apples? I can’t stress how important is to verify that the people you’re comparing in an experiment/study are the same (i.e., homogeneous in the lingo) in the metrics in which you choose to compare over time, and you must know the starting point of each group.",
