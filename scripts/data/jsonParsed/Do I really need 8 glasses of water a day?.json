  "content": "The guideline that says to drink at least 8 glasses of water that are 8 fluid ounces (oz) a day, or 64 oz per day, is often referred to as the “8 x 8” rule and it is popularly used as a benchmark for keeping hydrated. But there is no science supporting the “8 x 8” concept. The earliest cited source appears to be a 1945 report written by the National Research Council’s Food and Nutrition Board which stated that a “suitable allowance” of water for an adult was generally about 2.5 liters, which converts to 84.5 oz per day. To allow for a range of caloric intake from person to person, the report specified the guideline to 1 mL of water for each calorie of food. Based on a daily range of 1900 to 2400 calories per day, this converts to roughly 64 oz to 80 oz per day, the lower range of which would translate to 8 glasses of 8-oz daily servings, or “8 x 8.”",

  "title": "Fluid Intake and Dehydration",

  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The body has a pretty effective and attuned osmoregulatory system that maintains balance through mechanisms like thirst response and hormone secretion, such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which decreases renal fluid excretion. It is hard to imagine that evolution left us with a chronic water deficit so that we need to compensate by forcing fluid intake. This is all to say that eating a typical diet and drinking when thirsty is adequate to avoid dehydration. Furthermore, there is evidence that not all fluids need to be in the form of water. One study concluded that various beverages—including coffee, tea, and soft drinks—count toward daily fluid intake in healthy adults.",

  "title": "Caffeine and Fluid Loss",

  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "It does not seem to be the case that caffeine robs you of hydration status. But what about caffeine being a diuretic? It’s true that caffeine can induce an increase in urine output but you won’t lose more than you take in. In other words, you lose about as much fluid as you originally drank. Fluid loss due to caffeine is in the range of 1.17 mL per 1 mg of caffeine. Let’s take a standard cup of coffee that is 237 mL, or 8 oz, in which there is 95 mg of caffeine. If 1.17 mL of water is lost per 1 mg of caffeine, then there will be 111 mL of fluid excreted, leaving 126 mL left in the body.",

  "title": "Alcohol and Fluid Loss",
  "date": "January 17, 2021",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Recall that ADH signals your kidneys to hold on to water but when alcohol is in the system, it reduces how much ADH you make. This translates to more fluid expelled. Using the fluid loss finding, let’s consider 2 bottles of beer that are 355 mL each in volume. Beer is about 5% ethanol which yields 35.5 mL of alcohol consumed. Although you drink 710 mL of fluid, you expel an additional 284 mL, according to the ratio and general condition we have used (and multiplying 35.5 mL by the density of alcohol that is about 0.8 grams per mL). A total of 994 mL leaves the system, leaving you about 284 mL in the hole. So the water you take in from a typical alcoholic drink is outweighed by the water you lose to the alcohol’s diuretic action. But with low enough alcohol content, an alcoholic beverage could provide at least some hydration effect.",

  "content": "So how do we reconcile an arbitrary 8 glasses of 8 oz per day guideline with how much fluid we actually need? The recommendation of how much someone should drink is subject to a broad range of scenarios—like the aforementioned illness, heat, or exercise. The individual scenario—as is the case with most recommendations—is the determining factor. But what is certain is that applying the 8 x 8 rule to the general public is simply not supported by scientific data.",
