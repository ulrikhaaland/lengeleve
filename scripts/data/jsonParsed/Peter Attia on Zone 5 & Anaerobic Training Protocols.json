  "content": "Peterâ€™s approach to zone 5 training, and other anaerobic training protocols includes one time per week using a stairmaster with a 4 minute pattern: 3 minutes of zone 2 and 1 minute at his VO2 max. This is repeated for 20-30 minutes usually on the tail end of a zone two workout. He also does zone 5 on his bike: Four minutes at 125% of FTP (functional threshold power) followed by four minutes recovery. A one to one work/rest at a lower intensity than the 3 to 1 one rest to work that described on the stairmaster.",
