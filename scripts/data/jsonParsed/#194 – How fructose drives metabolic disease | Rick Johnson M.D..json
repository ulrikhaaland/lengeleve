In this episode, Rick explains how the body can generate fructose from glucose and how circulating glucose and salt levels can activate this conversion. He discusses the decline in metabolic flexibility associated with aging, as well as how factors such as sugar intake or menopause-associated hormone changes can alter responses to sugar across a lifetime. In addition, Rick lays out strategies for combating the development of metabolic illness using dietary changes and pharmaceutical therapies, and he discusses the impact of fructose metabolism and uric acid on kidney function and blood pressure. He concludes with a discussion of vasopressin, a hormone that facilitates fructose’s effects on weight gain and insulin resistance.",

The liver is one of the key sites of fructose metabolism that drives this whole process. When fructose gets to the liver, fructokinase phosphorylates it, and the ATP levels acutely fall. The low ATP state is maintained primarily by a drop in intracellular phosphate that accompanies this and that activates this enzyme system that removes the breakdown of ATP products. These 2 reactions occur together (shown in the Figure 1). ATP + H2O → ADP + Pi Fructose → Fructose-1-Phosphate. With ADP and Pi removed, ATP cannot be regenerated easily (see Figure 2). Normally AMP and ADP get reformed to make more ATP. 2 ADP → ATP + AMP. AMP deaminase breaks down the AMP stepwise until it produces uric acid, which is the end product of purine metabolism. The adenine of ATP is a purine, and it eventually gets broken down to uric acid. Uric acid inside the cell actually causes oxidative stress to the mitochondria. The mitochondria are also really important in ATP production. The oxidative stress affects the mitochondria in several ways. Uric acid also inhibits AMP kinase (AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase); this blocks energy production. In all, fructose metabolism stimulates fat storage.",

Expression of fructokinase can be turned on whenever there is injury. For example, it can be induced in the heart following a heart attack. It can be produced in the kidney further or be activated further to have kidney failure, following damage to the kidney from a COVID infection. Induced expression is probably trying to provide some “survival mechanisms” in these sites.

Leptin resistance is how fructose causes animals to eat more. This takes a month or so, but giving animals fructose leads to the animals becoming resistant to leptin. Leptin resistance can be determined experimentally— inject an animal with leptin and if they continue to eat a normal amount they are resistant to leptin. Evidence of leptin resistance can also be determined by studying the hypothalamus. There is a change in the hypothalamus, phosphorylation of STAT3. The mechanism of leptin resistance is not fully known, but there’s some evidence that it might be due to uric acid. A group in China injected uric acid in the brains of animals and showed that caused leptin resistance. They also showed that this caused inflammation in the hypothalamus. Inflammation in the hypothalamus is thought to be the driver for leptin resistance.",

Further support of this comes from experiments where glucose was given to animals that lack fructokinase. These animals cannot metabolize fructose through this ATP depletion pathway.

They’re really protected from the metabolic syndrome and they gain much less weight and have less fat. He does lots of pair feeding studies, in this case mice lacking fructokinase are drinking the same amount of glucose as normal controls (that have fructokinase). There may be 3-5% difference, but it’s very similar. The difference in body weight and fat is remarkable. So when he gave just glucose alone, the animals gained a little bit of weight, they drank a lot of glucose.

Impact of endogenous fructose production on obesity and metabolic syndrome [1:01:30]. Typical fructose consumption in the American diet. About 15-20% of the diet is from sugar (and sugar is half fructose and half glucose). So 10-15% of the diet is fructose. Fructose comes from added sugars, fruit, and other foods. Sugar in the diet can vary; some people are eating as much as 25% of their diet as sugar. So people can be eating as much as 15, even 20% of their diet as fructose. Conservatively, it’s not hard to eat 100 grams of fructose a day. 400 calories of fructose could represent 15% of the daily caloric intake. Let’s say the average American is eating 75-100 g of fructose; that’s their exogenous consumption of fructose. Let’s assume that person is a little bit insulin resistant and a little bit leptin resistant (but not off the charts); what is their endogenous production of fructose? A guess (based on animal data) would be around 25-50% more fructose comes from endogenous production. There are 3 major sources for endogenous fructose production. 1) High glycemic carbs such as rice, potatoes, bread, and chips [he will come back to the other 2 sources]. Maybe a quarter of that can be turned into fructose. Rick thinks this is playing a major role in metabolic syndrome.",

  "content": "“That may seem surprising because we don’t think of salt as driving obesity, it’s non caloric. But actually there’s data in humans that high salt diet also increases the risk for obesity and insulin resistance besides hypertension” – Rick Johnson. Mechanisms: How salt raises blood pressure and stimulates endogenous production of fructose. The mechanism is that as the salt concentration in the blood goes up, it activates the polyol pathway and turns on this enzyme (aldose reductase) to make fructose. Aldose reductase converts glucose to fructose. When one eats potato chips, the glucose and salt stimulates the enzyme to convert glucose to fructose. “French fries are particularly fattening because they have the salt and the carbs that together really turn on this pathway to make fructose” – Rick Johnson.",

  "content": "There is strong evidence in humans that serum sodium concentration activates aldose reductase; the data is very strong. Increased serum osmolality activates this pathway or increased salt concentration in the blood can activate the aldose reductase pathways. This data is very strong in humans; it’s very strong in all organisms. The change in osmolality is key; this is why elevated glucose can also activate this pathway. Peter notes that, “someone with type two diabetes and their glucose concentration is 140 milligrams per deciliter, that’s a huge osmolar load. So even if they have normal salt concentration, that could be activating it.”",

  "content": "Rick has done epidemiologic studies in humans, high salt intake increases the risk for fatty liver and diabetes. One study in Japanese adults, high salt also increased the risk for blood pressure. Published in Nutrients in 2020, Hyperosmolarity and Increased Serum Sodium Concentration Are Risks for Developing Hypertension Regardless of Salt Intake: A Five-Year Cohort Study in Japan. It’s the salt concentration that’s the greatest risk factor for high blood pressure, not the amount of salt one eats or how salty the food is. It’s how much salt goes up in the blood. For example, if someone drinks a lot of water and so the salt concentration doesn’t go up, then the effect of salt to raise blood pressure is blunted. He did a study in humans where they gave salty soup with or without water. Published in the Journal of Clinical Hypertension in 2018, Acute effects of salt on blood pressure are mediated by serum osmolality. If enough water was given to prevent the salt concentration from going up, this could prevent the rise in blood pressure. Salt increases the salt concentration in the blood, and that activates the osmol pathway.",

  "content": "Salt and sugar work together to drive blood pressure response and obesity. Salt increases vasopressin levels in the blood, which helps to conserve water. Fructose induces vasopressin gene expression and secretion. The ability of salt to raise blood pressure depends on an increase in serum osmolality. Vasopressin released from the brain helps hold onto water and drive fat. The V1b receptor is important in driving obesity, and blocking it can prevent obesity, metabolic syndrome, and other related conditions.",

  "content": "Vasopressin signaling through the V1b receptor drives obesity. Vasopressin levels go up in the blood when one eats salt or sugar. The V1b receptor stimulates a hormone called ACTH that stimulates cortisol steroids. It also stimulates the islets to produce glucagon, which counters the effects of insulin. The V1b receptor is expressed in the central nervous system, adrenal gland, and islet cells in the pancreas. It seems to be expressed in the liver in obesity.",

  "content": "Although they eat more fructose, they eat less chow; so they maintain their energy balance. They do not get fatty liver. They don’t get insulin resistant. They stay normal. The metabolic syndrome was driven through the energy depletion pathway; the actual caloric pathway is still intact. What we know is that it’s down regulating fructokinase; this is probably the key point. The V1B receptor knockout have less fructokinase; they’re turning it off; they’re reducing the amount. Normally when you eat sugar, the fructokinase levels get higher and higher. They get turned on by sugar. And the V1B knockout doesn’t do that; so the fructokinase stays at a low level. Rick’s guess is that some of the fructose is being metabolized by other enzymes, like glucose, glucokinase and stuff. What happens is they eat normal amounts and they stay normal weight and they don’t develop metabolic syndrome, but they don’t turn up their fructokinase.",

  "date": "February 7, 2022",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In the vasopressin story, a very important finding is that when he studied the fructose survival pathway, he found that the fat produced was not just being used as a caloric source, but it was being used as a source for water. Animals in the wild, when they store fat, they’re actually storing it not just for calories, but for water. While they’re storing fat, vasopressin levels are high. But vasopressin levels plummet during hibernation; that seems to allow them to burn the fat. During hibernation, they are making some urine, but their bladders stay permeable and so they reabsorb some of their urine. Rick doesn’t think they’re making large amounts of urine; it’s probably because of the low metabolism. Because they drop their temperature and their body metabolism so they’re generating less urine. But their vasopressin levels typically are turned off during hibernation. The big breakthrough was to realize that vasopressin is not just holding onto water by reducing the excretion (the volume of urine), but it’s also holding onto water by stimulating fat [synthesis]. Vasopressin stimulated fat synthesis through the V1b receptor. The V1b receptor increases cortisol. High cortisol levels can lead to Cushing Syndrome, these individuals develop kind of metabolic syndrome. The V1b receptor also stimulates glucagon, which raises glucose. This counters some of the effects of insulin; it creates an insulin resistant state. But also because the fructokinase in the liver seems to increase in the setting where the V1B receptor is activated. And that may help produce more energy depletion by increasing the enzyme [fructokinase], so that it can really metabolize the fructose as fast as it can. Rick thinks that is the mechanism. And animals that have the V1B receptor knocked out, they like sugar, they like salt, but they cannot metabolize the fructose very well and they seem to be protected from obesity.",
