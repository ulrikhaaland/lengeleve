AMP is removed by an enzyme called AMP deaminase, which is a very important enzyme in this pathway. AMP deaminase breaks down the AMP stepwise until it produces uric acid, which is the end product of purine metabolism. The adenine of ATP is a purine, and it eventually gets broken down to uric acid. Uric acid inside the cell actually causes oxidative stress to the mitochondria, which are also really important in ATP production. The oxidative stress affects the mitochondria in several ways. It inhibits an enzyme called aconitase, which is involved in the Krebs cycle and leads to citrate accumulation in the stimulation of fat production. It also blocks an enzyme called Enoyl-CoA hydratase. This enzyme is involved in beta fatty acid oxidation; blocking this blocks the burning of fatty acids. Ultimately, it reduces the production of ATP by blocking the Krebs cycle and by blocking the burning of fat.",

  "content": "Sugar is linked epidemiologically with the development of hypertension. There are studies out there where overweight people have gone on low-sugar diets and their blood pressure comes down. There’s evidence that it’s the fructose component that is driving the blood pressure response because acutely, giving fructose increases blood pressure.",

  "content": "When animals are put on a salty diet, they actually start producing fructose in their bodies. So salty foods turned out to be another way to stimulate fructose production. And when you give salt chronically to animals, they get high blood pressure, they get hypertrophy of their heart, and they also develop metabolic syndrome. They actually develop obesity, insulin resistance and everything.",

  "content": "Vasopressin signaling through the V1b receptor drives obesity. When one eats salt, or sugar, vasopressin levels go up in the blood. Fructose induces vasopressin gene expression. And the vasopressin released from the brain goes up in the blood and it helps hold onto water to try to help the body conserve water. But it is also helping the fructose to drive fat. When one eats fructose or salt, the fructose that’s produced from the salt stimulates vasopressin, and the vasopressin binds to a specific receptor called the V1b receptor.",

  "content": "Insight into fructose metabolism, uric acid, vasopressin, and the sequela that develops. When studying the fructose survival pathway, it was found that the fat produced was not just being used as a caloric source, but it was being used as a source for water. When fat is oxidized, it generates a ton of water (metabolic water). Animals in the wild, when they store fat, they’re actually storing it not just for calories, but for water. While they’re storing fat, vasopressin levels are high. But vasopressin levels plummet during hibernation; that seems to allow them to burn the fat. During hibernation, they are making some urine, but their bladders stay permeable and so they reabsorb some of their urine. But their vasopressin levels typically are turned off during hibernation.",

  "content": "Vasopressin is not just holding onto water by reducing the excretion (the volume of urine), but it’s also holding onto water by stimulating fat [synthesis]. Vasopressin stimulated fat synthesis through the V1b receptor. The V1b receptor increases cortisol. High cortisol levels can lead to Cushing Syndrome, these individuals develop kind of metabolic syndrome. The V1b receptor also stimulates glucagon, which raises glucose. This counters some of the effects of insulin; it creates an insulin resistant state.",

And that may help produce more energy depletion by increasing the enzyme [fructokinase], so that it can really metabolize the fructose as fast as it can. Animals that have the V1B receptor knocked out, they like sugar, they like salt, but they cannot metabolize the fructose very well and they seem to be protected from obesity.",
