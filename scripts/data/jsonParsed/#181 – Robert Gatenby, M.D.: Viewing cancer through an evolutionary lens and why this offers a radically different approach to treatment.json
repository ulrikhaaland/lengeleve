  "content": "A radiologist specializes in exploring theoretical and experimental models of evolutionary dynamics in cancer and cancer drug resistance. An adaptive therapy approach for treating cancer has shown promise in improving survival times with less cumulative drug use. The mathematical modeling of complex systems led to model the dynamics of tumor cell changes in cancer. A pilot clinical trial treating metastatic prostate cancer used an evolutionary game theory model to analyze patient-specific tumor dynamics and determine the on/off cycling of treatment. Altering chemotherapy to maximize the fitness ratio between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells can increase patient survival. Treatment of metastatic cancer may be improved using adaptive therapy and strategic sequencing of different chemotherapy drugs.",

Some therapies can act as a single event to cause extinction; the problem is it is in-discriminant. But most extinctions are multi-cause, multi-event processes.

  "content": "The war on cancer began with Nixon and is now in its 50th year and there’s not a lot to show for it. Consider the time and resources devoted to this problem. No one in the early 70’s, if they had a crystal ball and they were showed what cancer treatment is today would call it a success. There has been some progress but not a lot for the metastatic cancer population. It’s more or less as fatal as it was 50 years ago. It’s important to try to rethink what oncologists do. The current approach is to keep looking for new drugs, to do the same thing over and over again.",
