  "content": "Ecological models of pests and pesticides gave Bob big insight into cancer. The story of the diamondback moth was first recognized somewhere in the Midwest, in the mid 19th century. These moths have the honor of having been struck by every pesticide developed in the modern era, yet this has done absolutely nothing to its population; it’s spread all over the country, to Europe, Asia, everywhere. In the 1980s diamondback moths were uncovered that were not susceptible to any known pesticide; they’d become resistant to all of them. This is interesting, look at this whole process; farmers for centuries used pesticides freely; dump as much as possible on one’s field; get rid of as many of the pests as possible. But what people realized is, this practice is selecting for resistance. Experience has shown that large doses of pesticides give short-term gain, but in the long term, it doesn’t work. The Nixon administration using large doses of pesticides was no longer allowed; this was the beginning of integrated pest management. The idea is to give enough pesticide to knock a population low enough that they’re not going to do much crop damage, but don’t give more than that. There’s a number of ways this can be accomplished. Put pesticide on three quarters of the field and leave one quarter untouched; in this last quarter of the field, no selection for resistance is applied. This results in reducing the pest population and there is no selection for resistance.",

Cancer drugs are routinely approved without any knowledge of what the resistance mechanisms are let alone any plan to manage that in patients.

In the cost benefit ratio, when there is a lot of drug around, the benefit greatly outweighs the cost, but when there’s no drug present, then the benefit does not outweigh the cost. In the absence of drug, the guys that are not resistant don’t have to carry that machinery around with them and they are now more fit. There is a subtle competition that goes on. Select for resistance in  say the three quarters of the field; but when the ones that are sensitive move into that area and now the drug is gone, there’s no selection for resistance. Their fitness advantage will be such that when the pest population comes back to something close to what it was at the beginning, it’s as sensitive as it was in the beginning.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Bob’s pilot clinical trial: the advantages of adaptive therapy compared to standard prostate cancer treatment. Gatenby has published a study of men with prostate cancer where patients received drug until the tumor responded to 50% of its pretreatment value, then drug treatment was stopped. When the drug is not applied, the expectation is that sensitive cells will grow at the expense of drug-resistant cells. Models predict that when the  sensitive population declines (shown in purple in the figure below , the resistant population would increase (resistant cells shown in green). The idea is to let  the sensitive population grow and the resistant population would reach a plateau. This plateau was assumed to occur in each cycle, but stepwise the resistant population kept increasing and at some point control of tumor growth is lost and treatment fails. Peter remarks about the huge variance observed in treatment of patients in this study, 2-20 cycles; “that could be the difference between a few months and a few years. Why such a difference?” In this study, the fraction of the original tumor made up by the resistant population was unknown. So if it’s 1%, that takes longer than if it’s, let’s say 20 to 30%. The rate of proliferation also was not clear. Birth and death rates of cells were estimated. This was a pilot clinical trial of intermittent therapy compared to the standard therapy of maximum tolerated dose. The difference between the groups was 16 months. The median time to progression for standard of care was 14 months. The median time to progression for this intermittent/ adaptive therapy was 30 months. 4 of these 20 patients are now five years out and still cycling, being treated with adaptive therapy. These are patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Perhaps the most important thing that came out of this trial was the number seven, because the ratio of the fitness measure for the sensitive cells was seven fold that of the resistant cells. They had originally estimated this ratio at 2 or 3; 7 is a big difference in favor of the healthy cell. This shows that when the sensitive cells go down, resistant cells go up; then when sensitive cells go up, it was expected that resistant cells would plateau when in fact they went down. Patients enter a sweet spot after 3 cycles where the resistance cells progress toward extinction. Peter asks if substrate limits are the most important factors creating the fitness differential? Yes, this is the thought; drug-sensitive and resistant cells are competing for space and substrate. Blood flow and delivery of substrate is thought to be poor in the tumor; so substrate is probably the most limiting factor. Looking back at these 4 patients, it’s very rare that someone would go five years on this treatment using standard of care.",

Something about the protocol did not hit those 3 consecutive cycles perfectly. They over-treated; if they cut back on therapy, the results would have been better. The models predicted that every patient in both cohorts of this study could have gained control of the tumor indefinitely. The other cohort received standard of care; but his was not randomized.",

There’s a lot of cases where the initial therapy for cancers gets great results. Remission occurs but the  tumor eventually comes back; the resistant cells are there but in a very small number. The resistant cells are estimated to be much less fit than the sensitive cells in the absence of treatment.

Instead of continuing treatment when the tumor disappears, get the cancer populations to something that’s very, very small, and then hit them again with something different. Apply additional perturbations. Try an approach, called an extinction approach; this has not been explored yet. When there is a small population, a sequence of smaller perturbations can drive it to extinction. It’s a two step process. Extinction is achieved through a sequence of perturbations, none of which by itself could cause extinction. “For a century we’ve been looking for magic bullets, but maybe all we need is a series of pretty good bullets. So that’s a different sort of thinking process.” – Bob Gatenby. This is a hard sell, especially to a medical community where new drug development is what’s most incentivized.

Bob’s results suggest the opposite may be true; giving additional antibiotics might lead to resistance.

One difference between antibiotics and bacteria versus chemotherapy and cancer is one could live with billions of cancer cells in your body and be totally fine; it is not known if this is true for MRSA.

Tumor cells in a small population may not grow as fast as those in a large population; therefore, tumor cells in a small population may be more vulnerable to treatment. Small populations may not be as able to deal with immunotherapy or targeted therapy or even chemotherapy because they don’t have the capacity to act together. These are important factors in understanding treatment. Therapies that take large cancers and drive them down so they are not detectable by CT scans, create very small populations.

Waiting for progression means waiting until there are billions of cells; it has to be large enough to feel or image; that’s at least a CC of tumor if not 2-3 CC’s. Now this population is large; a few months earlier, a small population could have been treated. Leukemia is cured by using different treatments in sequence. Bob remarks “What’s interesting is that the pediatric oncologists learned this a long time ago. This is how they cure leukemia.” First, induction therapy is given. Then the therapy is immediately changed to a different drug.

Billion-dollar blockbuster drug, Avastin was probably the first. These drugs extend median survival by only a few months. Immunotherapy is another approach.

  "content": "Peter notes that it seems one could use selective chemotherapies and top it off with anti-VEGF treatment; then the real question becomes timing, how to cycle those on and off to maximize the gap in fitness. Peter asks Bob how to maximize the fitness ratio between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells and if his model predicts that 7 is the tipping point? It’s somewhere around 7, when the fitness of drug-sensitive cells are 7-times that of drug resistant cells then adaptive cycling of treatment favors eliminating the cancer. This ratio is going to vary from tumor to tumor, but I would guess the range is around 5. Peter wonders if anti-VEGF drugs play a critical role in this when the tumor is scattered. To anthropomorphize everything to our society, the United States at 330 million people; if the population were decimated by 90% and there were only 33 million people left, presumably we would no longer continue to be the United States of America. We would be a whole bunch of disparate tribes in total chaos. Therefore we’d be a heck of a lot more susceptible. Is that fair assessment? Bob agrees. In military talk, to defeat an enemy one does not have to deal with the whole population; instead they could do it one at a time. Bob relates this to tumors after neoadjuvant therapy; these small little populations look like they’re a hundred, maybe a thousand cells, not millions of cells. They’re widely separated; they’re not sending cells back and forth very much, if at all. It’s a very different dynamic than continuous tumors where if a corner of the tumor were removed, then everything just sort of moves in there and eventually it repopulates; this doesn’t occur in fragmented populations.",

An evolving population can never adapt to conditions it has not seen before. It cannot plan to make metastases, and it certainly can’t plan to feather its nest in some distant site before sending out its scouts. That’s not happening.” – Bob Gatenby\nIntroductions are seen in nature all the time; a species in introduced and sometimes it is successful and sometimes it is not\nIt  has to do with the way their phenotype interacts with the local adaptive landscape and how they adjust\nSometimes it takes several introductions before the species can expand; and sometimes they go on to die out\nFor example, there is a species coming out of the Amazon. The Amazon river collects trees and things that are floating down, the animals are on it and so they go out. Anything downstream of the Amazon is going to be receiving more of these, so they are more likely to see a metastatic monkey or something like that from the middle of the Amazon.\nBack to cancer, the pancreas spills into the portal vein, which then goes into the liver; it’s delivering a lot of its cells to the liver.

  "content": "Peter agrees; “the pancreas makes sense. But how do we make sense of the breast? How do we make sense of the prostate going to the bone disproportionately?” Bob suggests a general principle, that there’s something about some of the breast cancer cells that seem to be able to set up shop in bones, some of them in the lung. All  for reasons that are not yet clear. Bob goes back to something Peter mentioned about – source sink, that’s dynamic. Source habitat, sink habitats, habitats that have very good blood supply, they are producing a lot of cells; too many cells for the spatial environment, and those cells have to go out. In a tumor there are areas with poor blood flow and good blood flow next to one another; one can  imagine cells migrating between these areas. This can set up dynamics that are very interesting. Think of a breast cancer cell near a blood vessel, now it’s proliferating and there are too many cells, they crowd into the blood vessels; now the blood sends the cells out. What if there are syn habitats for this breast cancer cell somewhere else. The limiting factor is the dynamics at the metastatic site. If mice are injected with cancer cells, nearly all of these cells die at metastatic sites; only a small percentage of them will grow to form even a few cells. This speaks to the importance of small population dynamics; there’s stochastic effects, Allee effects and a lot of statistical problems with going from a single cell to a cancer that’s significant. “We are very lucky for that because we know that human cancers are frequently dumping millions of cells into the blood, and yet metastases are relatively rare.” – Bob Gatenby. Think of people with early stage lung cancer, one can find cancer cells in their bone marrow, and yet they don’t get bone marrow metastasis. The same for breast cancer; a bone marrow biopsy on women getting mastectomies for apparently localized disease show breast cancer cells in their bone marrow, but all of them do not develop metastatic disease. Peter asks how much of that is attributed to the Allee effects and the stochastic variability that says, “Look, they’re just not going to be fit enough to take up residence there.” Versus some other inherent principle of like the genetic robustness of the tumor itself? Because a lot of those women may go on to get adjuvant therapy; and then it becomes a question of how successful was the adjuvant therapy.",

Bob suggested trying radiation first then surgery to see if something can be learned about how these cells change during radiation therapy. It’s hard to convince anyone to try this because it’s not the way it’s done. Surgeons don’t want to work on anything that’s been treated with radiation first. Bob hasn’t pushed for this because he is afraid of causing harm to the patient.",

  "content": "There is a need to know more about the biology of this cancer. Pancreatic cancers have a lot of fibrosis associated with them. One big question is – “is that fibrosis a host response or a tumor adaptive strategy?” If it’s a host response then maybe the fibroblasts could kill off the tumor cells. Giving fibroblast growth factor may help the fibroblasts compete with the tumor cells for space.",

It’s easier for patients who are just presenting with cancer than for those who have been through many therapies. Bob’s father died of esophageal cancer and he remembers the desperation and despair that comes at the end stages of disease. The war on cancer began with Nixon and is now in its 50th year and there’s not a lot to show for it. Consider the time and resources devoted to this problem.",
