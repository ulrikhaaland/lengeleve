About 20% of the study population has the “bad” variant of the gene. What they saw is that there was no increase in risk having the bad variant. However, if coupled with a lot of childhood stress, there was about a 20x increase. The same childhood stressors to people without the “bad” gene variant had only a moderate increase in depression incidence.

Peter’s possible explanation: if you’re sleep deprived, you’re body is assuming there is a good reason for it so you want cortisol to keep you awake and alert. ⇒ Robert’s take: If you’re a basic mammal and you are wide awake when you’re supposed to be asleep… this does not happen by chance… the odds are you have something stressful going on. The subtle interplay of sleep, sleep quality, and cortisol. What we know now… Circadian peak of glucocorticoids are around the time you wake up. An hour before you wake up, levels begin to rise, not for dealing with a stressor that has already commenced, but in preparation for having to get up and function. Interesting sleep study: Take a group of volunteers. The first night, tell them that this night we’re going to wake you up at 4 AM. The result? ⇒ Around 3 AM their glucocorticoid levels start rising. Then, the next night you tell them I’m going to wake you up at some point during the night and that’s the end of your night’s sleep. Result? ⇒ After 90 minutes (one sleep cycle), their cortisol rises and stays high for the rest of the night. So, not only is it bad not to get enough sleep, and not only is it bad if that insufficient sleep is fragmented, but the worst is if it’s fragmented unpredictably. “And that’s like every medical resident in history.” In med school, Peter will literally tape a pager to his forehead because he was worried about sleeping through the call. “It’s wildly destructive.” It turns out if you have elevated glucocorticoid levels while you’re asleep: You have less delta sleep time (restorative sleep). You make less adenosine stores in your brain.",
