Discusses how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other.",

Adrenaline in two seconds is handing guns out of the gun locker into whoever’s gonna defend you. Glucocorticoids are building the aircraft carriers that a year from now are gonna be essential. It does some of the slower components in the stress response, stretching out over minutes to hours. Adrenaline comes in immediately and triggers fight or flight for those initial few seconds. But 30 seconds later (or minutes later), then glucocorticoids come in. They increase vigilant thinking (in terms of smart evasion of the predator). The are bolstering the same process that epinephrine is boosting: Increasing glucose levels in your bloodstream. Going to storage sites throughout your body (liver, muscle) and breaking stuff down. Additionally, glucocorticoids shut down everything that’s not essential to surviving the next five minutes of this massive physical challenge. Digestion is impaired. Growth hormones are turned off. Reproduction is shut off.",

Individual variation plays a role in what each person's optimum amount of stress is. Hormone receptors also play a role in how people respond to stress. The level of receptors of the hormones, rather than the level of hormone itself, can be more consequential. Individual differences in levels of receptors, what version you have, how well that works, how avidly it holds onto the hormone, what it is then coupled with afterward downstream inside the cell, can be central to understanding individual differences.",
