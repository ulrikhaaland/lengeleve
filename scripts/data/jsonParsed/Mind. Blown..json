Many people would have a hard time riding a bicycle 50 miles in less time. Averaged a 5:48 mile for almost five hours. Imagine running on a treadmill at 10.3 mph for five hours.",

  "content": "Project Carbon X was part promotion and part athletic endeavor. A similar event was Breaking2, where three participants set out to run 26.2 miles in under two hours. Project Carbon X was IAAF-approved for world record status while Breaking2 was not. Finished Breaking2 in 2:00:25, which is over a minute faster than the official world record, 2:01:39. Averaged a 4:36 mile for a shade over two hours. Imagine running on a treadmill at 13 mph for two hours.",

  "content": "Both feats demonstrate a remarkable display of specialization. Won the world championship in the 5K at age 18. Generalization and specialization have been on mind recently. Curious about the journey of many people who excel in a given field, and whether there are more similarities than differences in how they got to that position.",
