  "content": "The synthetic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology has been brought to the forefront of public attention with the success of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Possibilities for synthetic mRNA have been the focus of decades-long scientific research. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were able to produce their respective vaccines as quickly as they did because both companies had invested in research on mRNA-based treatments long before COVID-19 appeared on the scene.",

  "content": "There are other RNA-based vaccine applications in ongoing research that preceded the widespread use of COVID-19. RNA-based technology is used in a recent malaria vaccine patent and BioNTech uses the technology in its cancer immunotherapy research where the mRNA vaccine is individually adapted to target specific tumor mutations. Pfizer-BioNTech had already been working on mRNA-based seasonal influenza vaccine research.",

  "content": "The success of the mRNA technology used in COVID-19 vaccines does not guarantee success in other applications. The technology is not a panacea. It could be that SARS-CoV-2 is the perfect viral candidate, for a few reasons. Given their prior mRNA research, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNtech already understood how to edit the mRNA molecule with the selected SARS-CoV-2 viral protein. The mRNA technology worked for COVID-19, but that does not mean it will work against other viruses.",

  "content": "The success of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is a product of previous research and what might seem like failures. The mRNA vaccine strategy itself, which was used in this case to code for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and instruct the immune system to recognize and respond against it, has an extensive developmental history paved with trials and failures. Previous research “failings” of successful synthetic mRNA application paved the way for better understanding and new application pursuits.",

  "content": "One editorial contends that the failures to produce an HIV vaccine were neither a waste of time nor economic resources because they propelled innovative advances which led to effective antiviral vaccines like the one for COVID-19. More specifically, a line of research from failed HIV vaccines laid the foundational understanding for the vaccine model that uses a purified viral protein, as in the case of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.",

The current success of mRNA technology in COVID-19 vaccines calls into question what scientific “failure” actually means. It is a truism by now, but given how success is made possible by understanding how something doesn’t work, prior failings may be more aptly referred to as the ruling out of possibilities.",
