First, it turns out, he was a creature of habit, routine, and discipline even in the most stressful of times. Secondly, he made time for hobbies and time away from “work”.",

  "content": "Stoics were a big proponent of journaling. Ryan recommends it to people … he describes the benefit as follows: “I’m really trying to use it as a place to sort of remind myself and reiterate to myself, like how I want to be inside this. It’s sort of reminders of like, ‘Hey, you’re worried about X, Y, and Z. You know, one way not to think about that is to think about other people instead.’ So I’m trying to just like sort of buck myself up a little bit in the morning, kind of remind myself of what’s important to me. I think journaling is not this, just this stream of conscious sort of thing you’re doing. It’s not performing for history. To me it should be, it’s like, it’s like playing scales on the guitar or on the piano. You’re running yourself through it over and over again. So that it gets more imputed into your memory and kind of into your being.” Peter tells the story about how his 11 year old daughter was having a hard time comprehending how she was going to have to stay at home and “shelter in place”. Purpose, goal setting, and projects During this time, we should be asking ourselves, “What goals or things can we give ourselves (and our kids) that we can throw ourselves into that allows us to sort of escape from this a little bit?”",

Ryan is actually worried that the revolutionary extremes on both the left and right will “seize upon the wreckage that emerges from this and are actually empowered.” Ryan is worried for the millennial generation who were starting to sort of mature (saving up, good jobs, buying homes, etc.) and they’ve been hit by another economic disaster.",
