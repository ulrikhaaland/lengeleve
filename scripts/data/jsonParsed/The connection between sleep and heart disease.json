  "content": "Lack of sleep increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that getting 5 hours of sleep or less can lead to a 200-300% increased risk of coronary artery calcification. The mechanism behind this is that with lack of sleep, the body becomes much more driven by the sympathetic nervous system, leading to atherosclerosis. Lack of sleep also increases blood pressure (hypertension), which is a risk factor for Alzheimerâ€™s disease.",
