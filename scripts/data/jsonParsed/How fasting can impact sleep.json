  "content": "Peter says some of his patients who do multi-day fasting (3+ days) will struggle with falling asleep and staying asleep at night (less so with time-restricted eating or just a 1-day fast). On flip side, the sleep you DO get actually seems remarkable. Heart rate variability goes up by 25- 50%, resting heart rate goes down, body temperature goes down, and his best nights in terms of staging—Deep sleep is 25%, REM sleep is 25%.",

  "content": "Matt commonly hears the following from fasters—they struggle with falling asleep and staying asleep. However, he also hears in many cases that the lesser amount of sleep doesn’t bother them. In other words, they don’t feel as sleepy as they normally would (i.e., that little sleep would normally have them feeling miserable).",

  "title": "The role of orexin in sleep",
  "date": "May 31, 2022",
  "context": "Diet & Sleep",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Orexin turns out to be a wake promoting chemical. So when you release and dump orexin into the brain and the body, it wakes the brain up. Normally it shuts down at night and that’s part of the mechanism of what we call the sleep-wake switch. When animals go under conditions of starvation, these orexin cells sense the change in the energy balance and they start dumping out more orexin which forces the animal artificially awake for a longer period of time. In humans under conditions of fasting, Matt thinks you are giving the body an ancient, evolutionary signal of starvation which causes the brain to dump more orexin into the system and therefore your sleep becomes compressed. It turns out that while the sleep is compressed, the body makes up for that by increasing the quality of that  sleep (something you see with insomnia patients being treated with sleep restriction therapy).",
