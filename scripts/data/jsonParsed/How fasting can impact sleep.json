  "content": "Some patients who do multi-day fasting (3+ days) struggle with falling asleep and staying asleep at night. However, the sleep they do get seems remarkable with improved sleep metrics such as increased heart rate variability, decreased resting heart rate, and decreased body temperature. Despite getting less sleep, many fasters report not feeling as sleepy as they normally would.",

  "date": "May 31, 2022",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Orexin, a chemical in the hypothalamus, monitors the body’s energy balance by sensing concentrations of circulating levels of leptin and ghrelin. Orexin is a wake promoting chemical that is released into the brain and body, waking the brain up. It is regulated by hunger signaling hormones like leptin and ghrelin, the master circadian clock called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the body’s energy balance.",

  "date": "May 31, 2022",
  "context": "Diet & Sleep",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Under conditions of fasting, orexin cells sense the change in the body's energy balance and start releasing more orexin, which forces the body to stay awake for a longer period of time. This is an ancient, evolutionary signal of starvation which causes the brain to release more orexin into the system and therefore sleep becomes compressed.",

  "context": "Diet & Sleep",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "While sleep is compressed during fasting, the body makes up for that by increasing the quality of sleep. This is not sustainable over the long term but it does partly explain the observations of improved sleep metrics and people feeling like they aren’t as sleepy as they typically would expect due to the shorter sleep.",
