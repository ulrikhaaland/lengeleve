  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Is there a “metabolic advantage” to being in ketosis? Few topics in the nutrition blogosphere generate so much vitriolic rhetoric as this one. The question is whether or not, calorie-for-calorie, a person in ketosis has a higher resting energy expenditure. In other words, does a person in ketosis expend more energy than a person not in ketosis because of the caloric composition of what they consume/ingest? The question has not been addressed sufficiently in a properly controlled trial and, at best, we can look to lesser controlled trials and clinical observations to a make a best guess.",

  "title": "Ketosis and Energy Expenditure",

  "context": "Ketosis",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There is sufficient clinical evidence to suggest that carbohydrate restriction may increase total energy expenditure (TEE) in subjects, though there is great variability across studies and within subjects. The bigger question is if ketosis does so to a greater extent than would be expected/predicted based on just the further reduction in carbohydrate content. In other words, is there something “special” about ketosis that increases TEE beyond the dose effect of carbohydrate removal? That study has not been done properly, yet.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Does ketosis offer a physical performance advantage? Many frameworks exist to define physical performance which center around speed, strength, agility, and endurance. The answers to these questions are probably as follows: Does ketosis enhance aerobic capacity? Likely. Does ketosis enhance anaerobic power? No. Does ketosis enhance muscular strength? Unlikely. Does ketosis enhance muscular endurance? Likely.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "An elegant way to test the relative impact of glucose, insulin, and B-OHB on muscular efficiency is to “treat” a perfused rat heart under the following four conditions: Glucose alone (G), Glucose + insulin (GI), Glucose + B-OHB (GK), Glucose + insulin + B-OHB (GIK). Adding insulin to a fixed glucose (GI) load increases both cardiac output and hydraulic work, but it’s only significant in the case of hydraulic work. Conversely, adding B-OHB to glucose (GK) increases both cardiac output and hydraulic work significantly. Interestingly, combining insulin and B-OHB with glucose (GIK) increases neither.",

  "content": "GI and GIK both significantly increase glucose concentration in the cell, while GK does not. The GI and GIK treatments both increase the number of GLUT4 transporters translocated to the cell surface so more glucose can flux in. GK does increase glucose concentration, but not significantly (in the statistical sense).",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Delta G, or Gibbs free energy, is the “free” (though a better term is probably “available” or “potential”) energy of a system. The more negative Delta G is, the more available (or potential or “free”) energy exists in the system. The Gibbs free energy of the GI, GK, and GIK states are all more negative than that of just glucose. In other words, these interventions offer more potential energy (with less oxygen consumption, which is the really amazing part).",

These changes, taken together, widen the energetic gap between the states and, in turn, translates to a higher (i.e., more negative) Delta G which translates to greater ATP production per unit of carbon.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Recall that ketones make their way onto the metabolic playing field without going through PDH. Adding more insulin to the equation forces more pyruvate towards PDH into acetyl CoA. While B-OHB “mimics” the effect of additional insulin, it does so in a much cleaner fashion without the complex cascade of events brought on by additional insulin (e.g., decreased lipolysis) and, perhaps most importantly, avoids the logjam of impaired PDH due to insulin resistance.",
