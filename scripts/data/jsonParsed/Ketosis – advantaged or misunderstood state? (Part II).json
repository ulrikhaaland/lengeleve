  "context": "Ketosis",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The question of whether or not a person in ketosis has a higher resting energy expenditure than a person not in ketosis because of the caloric composition of what they consume/ingest has not been addressed sufficiently in a properly controlled trial. The study by Barry Sears sought to compare a non-ketogenic low carb (NLC) diet to a ketogenic low carb (KLC) diet. Despite the study participants having food provided, the KLC group was not actually in ketosis as evidenced by their B-OHB levels. Both groups experienced an increase in REE, but this study did not settle the 'dose-response' question.",

  "content": "Subjects being evaluated in such studies will typically be housed in a metabolic ward (don’t confuse a metabolic ward with a metabolic chamber; the ward is simply a fancy hospital unit; the chamber is where the measurements are made) under strict supervision and every few days will spend an entire 24 hour period in one such chamber in complete isolation (so no other consumption of oxygen or production of carbon dioxide will interfere with the measurement).  This is the ‘gold standard’ for measuring TEE, and shy of doing this it’s very difficult to measure differences within about 300 kcal/day.",

  "content": "A broader question, which overlays this one, is whether any change in macronutrients impacts TEE. Despite the limitations we allude to in the summary of this review, there is a growing body of recent literature (for example this study, this study, and this study) that do suggest a thermogenic effect, specifically, of a ketogenic diet, possibly through fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) which increases with B-OHB production by the liver.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Does ketosis offer a physical performance advantage? Like the previous question this one needs to be defined correctly if we’re going to have any chance at addressing it. Many frameworks exist to define physical performance which center around speed, strength, agility, and endurance.  For clarity, let’s consider the following metrics which are easy to define and measure. Aerobic capacity, Anaerobic power, Muscular strength, Muscular endurance. There are certainly other metrics against which to evaluate physical performance (e.g., flexibility, coordination, speed), but I haven’t seen much debate around these metrics. To cut to the chase, the answers to these questions are probably as follows: Does ketosis enhance aerobic capacity? Likely, Does ketosis enhance anaerobic power? No, Does ketosis enhance muscular strength? Unlikely, Does ketosis enhance muscular endurance? Likely.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The heart is studied because the work action is (relatively) simple to measure: cardiac output, which is the product of stroke volume (how much blood the heart pumps out per beat) and heart rate (how many times the heart beats per minute). One can also measure oxygen consumption, all intermediate metabolites, and then calculate cardiac efficiency. Efficiency increases as work increases relative to oxygen consumption.",

  "context": "Ketosis",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "An elegant way to test the relative impact of glucose, insulin, and B-OHB on muscular efficiency is to “treat” a perfused rat heart under the following four conditions: Glucose alone (G), Glucose + insulin (GI), Glucose + B-OHB (GK), Glucose + insulin + B-OHB (GIK). Adding insulin to a fixed glucose (GI) load increases both cardiac output and hydraulic work, but it’s only significant in the case of hydraulic work. Conversely, adding B-OHB to glucose (GK) increases both cardiac output and hydraulic work significantly. Interestingly, combining insulin and B-OHB with glucose (GIK) increases neither.",

Because for less oxygen consumption, the hearts were able to deliver greater cardiac output and accomplish greater hydraulic work.) The figure on the bottom right shows this exactly.",

In other words, these interventions offer more potential energy (with less oxygen consumption, don’t forget, which is the really amazing part).",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "According to Kevin, it is not generally appreciated how making ketones from fatty acids affects overall energy efficiency. Nevertheless, this can be examined by comparing the enthalpy of combustion of 4.5 moles of B-OHB, which is about -2,192 kcal, with the enthalpy of combustion of 1 mole of stearic acid (about -2,710 kcal) that was used to produce the 4.5 moles of ketones. Thus, there is about 20% energy loss in this process. Hence, the energy gain provided by the ketones is actually less than the energy cost of making them, at least in theory. This suggests that being in nutritional ketosis may require more overall system energy, while still increasing work potential. In other words, a person in nutritional ketosis may increase their overall energy expenditure, while at the same time increasing their muscular efficiency. In honor of Kevin, I refer to this as the Hall Paradox.",
