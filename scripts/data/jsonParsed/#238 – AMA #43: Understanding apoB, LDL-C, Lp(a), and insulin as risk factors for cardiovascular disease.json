  "content": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death in both men and women. The most important risk factors for ASCVD include apoB, LDL, hyperinsulinemia, and Lp(a). These factors are interrelated and confer risk through various mechanisms. For instance, high apoB and LDL-C directly impact ASCVD risk. Hyperinsulinemia, often accompanying type 2 diabetes, accelerates the risk through mechanisms like upregulation of APOC3 expression, which regulates apoB in the wrong direction. Other risk accelerators include smoking and high blood pressure. Lowering apoB can reduce ASCVD risk, and this can be achieved through dietary changes or pharmacotherapy.",

  "content": "ApoB and LDL-C are often in concordance, but sometimes they're in discordance. LDL-C is a laboratory measurement that measures the concentration of cholesterol contained within the LDL particles. ApoB is the concentration of all particles that carry the apoB lipoprotein, which includes LDL, VLDL, and Lp(a). The higher the LDL cholesterol concentration, the more likely the risk. However, apoB is a better predictor of risk because it captures not only the concentration of LDL, but also the other atherogenic particles—namely the VLDL. Lp(a) is generally captured inside of the LDL.",

Lower levels of insulin are probably better than higher levels of insulin, but it’s not clear how much of that is true once you’ve corrected for apoB. When apoB skyrockets in the presence of falling insulin and triglycerides, all evidence to date suggests your risk of ASCVD has not gone down. If a person is on a diet that is creating benefits in some ways, but it’s driving apoB up, they basically have two choices. One is to abandon the diet.

Triglycerides of 400 is an abnormally high number for a fasting level. If a person’s been fasting for 12 hours and their triglyceride level is over 400, they’re either profoundly insulin resistant or they have a genetic disorder that results in elevated levels of triglycerides.",
