Peter also dives deep into the data around apoB to try to answer the question of how much residual risk is conferred for ASCVD through metabolic dysfunction once you correct for apoB. He also looks at the data around lifetime risk reduction of ASCVD in the context of low apoB.",

If we increase the expression of APOC3, it blocks the activation of something called lipoprotein lipase or LPL. LPL is an enzyme that sits on cells that basically performs a function of controlling lipolysis. One of the side effects we see of blocked LPL activity is less utilization of triglyceride. If you’re using them less, what’s happening? You’re increasing the amount of triglyceride you have. If we are increasing expression of APOC3 and blocking the action of lipoprotein lipase, we’re going to see a net increase in triglyceride. Furthermore, we’re going to see a specific increase in a type of LDL which is triglyceride rich. We really don’t want to see these triglyceride-rich LDLs. We want the triglycerides to be utilized because if you have now triglyceride-rich LDLs and their purpose there is to really carry cholesterol, what does the body do? It has to make more LDLs. That means the concentration of apoB is going up. That’s the most important mechanism. The way we basically see that is we’re going to see high plasma levels of triglycerides, and we’re going to see other things as well going to see HDL cholesterol concentration go down.",

We’ve also just established that while lower levels of insulin are probably better than higher levels of insulin, it’s not clear how much of that is true once you’ve corrected for apoB. When apoB skyrockets in the presence of falling insulin and triglycerides, all evidence to date suggests your risk of ASCVD has not gone down. It is therefore our position that if a person is on a diet that is creating benefits in some ways, for example, weight loss, amelioration of insulin resistance, but it’s driving apoB up, and they’re really serious about longevity and reducing the risk of disease, they basically have two choices. One is to abandon the diet. The other is to stay on the diet and take lipid lowering medication. And it’s not a “failure” to have to take a medication to lower apoB in the presence of a diet that is otherwise potentially working for somebody.",

Once the triglycerides are above 400, you run into a world of different problems, like pancreatitis. Just for people to know, triglycerides of 400 is an abnormally high number for a fasting level. It’s not uncommon to see a level of 400 if you accidentally draw somebody’s blood after they’ve eaten. But if a person’s been fasting for 12 hours and their triglyceride level is over 400, they’re either profoundly insulin resistant or they have a genetic disorder that results in elevated levels of triglycerides.

All you have to do is not smoke, have perfect blood pressure, and have apoB concentration below the fifth percentile. If you do those things, it’s really hard to get ASCVD. So yes, everybody in my book should have apoB reduced provided they can tolerate the treatment that’s necessary to do that.",

  "content": "When it comes to patients with high Lp(a), there’s a special consideration: There’s one class of drug on the market today that at least has some chance of lowering Lp(a), and that is the PCSK9 inhibitors. Our first line lipid lowering medication in patients with elevated Lp(a) is not a statin but is, in fact, a PCSK9 inhibitor, which on average probably reduces Lp(a) concentration by about 30%. Note that for some patients it will be a 60% reduction, and in others almost no reduction. It remains to be seen whether that has any bearing on outcomes. It might be that reducing Lp(a) by 30% isn’t enough, but it’s certainly better than increasing the risk. But given that what we’re doing primarily is lowering apoB, that would be my preferred approach.",

The point here is we have these drugs at our disposal, and utilizing them doesn’t necessarily mean anything negative about the person that has to utilize them. We should get over that hump because, as we said, if we want to really fight this number one cause, we need to use everything at our disposal.",

  "content": "There’s a little bit too much black-and-white thinking around this space. And everything that transpired as a result of COVID has only made this worse. For very understandable reasons, the public has grown far more skeptical of big pharma. There were a lot of the shenanigans around claims that were made with respect to the COVID vaccine that turned out not to be true (when it was known that they were not true). That’s the part that many people struggle with. Again, the COVID vaccines are safe, but… The vaccines absolutely reduce the risk of hospitalization and death, but they didn’t really reduce the risk of transmission. And the magnitude of the reduction in healthy people was questionable. There were side effects that were not acknowledged. It’s very hard to hold all of these conflicting truths simultaneously.",

It’s important to be able to think in a manner that’s called dialectically, which is simultaneously hold things true that seem contradictory. It seems contradictory that a company can make money selling you a drug and that that drug can actually improve your life. You might be thinking that it “should” be that if somebody’s making money on you, it should be hurting you…But if you think about it, that’s a very illogical position. For instance, I go to a gym and I pay them a membership. By definition, they can’t be breaking even on me. They have to be making money on me to go to the gym. But does that mean going to the gym is bad? ⇒ No.",
