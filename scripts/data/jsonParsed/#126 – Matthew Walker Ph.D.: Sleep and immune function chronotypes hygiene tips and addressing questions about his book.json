He then covers topics such as how dreaming affects emotional health, the different sleep chronotypes, the best sleep hygiene tips, and the pros and cons of napping. Matthew finishes by addressing several of the errors that readers have pointed out in his book, Why We Sleep.",

A large prospective study of over 50,000 women found that women who were sleeping 5 hours or less were 70% more likely to develop pneumonia (a component risk in the equation of COVID). Mouse study suggesting a causal relationship: When mice are selectively deprived mice of various stages of sleep (particularly REM sleep) and exposed to malaria, they were far more likely to die as a consequence compared to the well-rested mice. A study looking at response to flu vaccines found that not getting sufficient sleep in the week before you get your flu shot resulted in producing less than 50% of the normal antibody response therefore rendering that flu vaccination significantly less effective.",

And you can some benefit from a cardiovascular standpoint as well (unpublished data from Matt). Downside of naps is that it can take away which is sleep pressure which could exacerbate nighttime sleep issues. If you are struggling with falling asleep at night (sleep onset insomnia), avoid naps during the day. You want to build up as much sleep pressure/sleepiness as you possibly can during the day. On the flip side, if you are not struggling with your sleep at night, there’s no problem with napping regularly during the day. If you study hunter-gatherer tribes (whose way of life hasn’t changed for thousands of years), they don’t necessarily sleep the way that we do today. During the summer months, they will typically have an afternoon nap. This make sense because when you study human brains you see that somewhere between about 2:00 to 4:00 PM we have a drop in physiological alertness. As a species, we’re almost pre-programmed to have this enforced dip in our alertness suggesting maybe we should be biphasically sleeping (as opposed to monophasically sleeping) at certain times during the year. Typically pretty short, says Matt, less than 90 minutes. Hunter gatherers would typically sleep just six-and-a-half hours at night, and then they would make the rest up with an afternoon nap (which matches most sleep experts recommendation that we get 7-9 hours per night).",

After 5-10 minutes of standing you just think, “God, I just want to sit down. I just want to get into bed.”4—Set manageable goalsMatt references BJ Fogg, a researcher at Stanford, who looks at behavioral change and applies it to sleep—If you are accustomed to checking your phone the moment you wake up, try to start by giving yourself five minutes without checking itNext, keep pushing it longer and longer (10 min, 20 min, and so on)Don’t set yourself up for failure, ease into it and set yourself up for success",

Said another way, if you have a certain type of gene compliment that makes you a morning type, your peak alertness is going to arrive earlier in the day and the downstroke of your circadian rhythm will arrive earlier in the evening. In other words, your circadian rhythm looks very similar in its sinusoidal pattern but WHEN the peak and the trough of that circadian rhythm arrive on the 24 hour clock face is very different to a morning type compared to an evening type.",

  "content": "Night terrors are typically where people (mostly kids) wake up with a terrible sense of dread and fear (the child is often inconsolable at that stage). Many parents report that young children seem to get sleep terrors (aka night terrors) when they are overly exhausted compared to when they are well-rested. The night terror events seem to happen during deep non-REM sleep (i.e., dreamless sleep) rather than during REM sleep (which might explain why the child rarely remembers anything). When a child spends an extended time being awake or miss a nap (i.e., they are exhausted), they will typically then have a homeostatic increase in the amount of deep sleep. So they’re probably going to go into deep non-REM sleep in a more intense fashion or with greater amounts of deep sleep duration. This therefore means that the probabilistic likelihood of them having one of these night terrors is increased as a consequence.",
