  "content": "The relationship between atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) clinical outcomes and increased concentration of apolipoprotein B (apoB) has been frequently discussed. An article published last month described the first human patient to undergo a therapeutic gene-editing treatment to lower apoB. If this therapy works in humans, it has the potential to be a one-time, permanent treatment with significant effects on ASCVD risk reduction.",

  "title": "Current Treatments for Reducing ApoB Levels",
  "date": "August 6, 2022",
  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Reducing apoB levels relies on increasing hepatic clearance of LDL particles from circulation, which is often achieved through the use of pharmaceuticals such as statins and PCSK9 inhibitors. However, these require daily pills or monthly injections, and once prescribed, they are often a lifelong commitment. The cost and imperfect compliance associated with these treatments make the possibility of a one-time therapeutic treatment to lower apoB intriguing.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The PCSK9 gene was discovered because of a rare mutation causing an upregulation of PCSK9 and consequent familial hypercholesterolemia. Other naturally occurring variants, found in 2-3% of the population, are associated with loss of PCSK9 function. Individuals with these variants exhibit lifelong low levels of circulating apoB, resulting in lower risk of ASCVD. These protective variants result from a change in just a single nucleotide within the genetic sequence, and they are not associated with any serious adverse health consequences.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The CRISPR therapeutic treatment of the first human comes on the heels of successful preliminary experiments in nonhuman primates. Through the use of lipid nanoparticles, these experiments were able to target CRISPR treatment preferentially to liver cells – the primary organ that expresses the PCSK9 gene and the key site for clearing LDL from plasma. In three cynomolgus monkeys, using a one-time intravenous infusion was able to achieve over a 60% gene editing frequency. A year later, circulating PCSK9 was reduced by 90% and LDL-C was reduced by 60% – the same reduction achieved in a clinical trial combining statins and PCSK9 inhibitor therapy – with no adverse health effects observed in any of the monkeys.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "One concern with this type of therapy is the possibility of off-target gene editing, either through editing in tissues other than the liver or through editing at genomic sites other than the PCSK9 gene. In the primate studies, gene editing frequency was assessed in fifteen different tissue types and was found to occur primarily in the liver, with much lower frequencies of editing in the spleen and adrenal glands, and minimal in all other tissues.",

  "content": "CRISPR gene-editing therapy for lowering apoB is still in the early stages of testing. The results in the coming months from the first patient will provide insight into how this technology stacks up compared to pharmaceuticals. Further larger scale and longer-term studies will be needed to determine any potential side-effects or negative outcomes of treatment before it can become widely available. Unlike medications, once administered this therapeutic option can’t be reversed, so it is important to do a thorough risk assessment before making it publicly accessible.",

  "date": "August 6, 2022",
  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Gene-editing could potentially be used for treating high levels of apoB. However, finances will be a major initial barrier to treatment. The few CRISPR therapies approved for use are in rare diseases, and the cost of these treatments range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. High levels of apoB affect about a third of the U.S. population. If the cost of a treatment decreases at scale, the cost of a one-time treatment may outweigh the cost of decades of medication. The long-term benefits of lowering apoB through a one-time treatment may make this not only a viable future option, but potentially an intervention that could change preventive cardiovascular medicine.",
