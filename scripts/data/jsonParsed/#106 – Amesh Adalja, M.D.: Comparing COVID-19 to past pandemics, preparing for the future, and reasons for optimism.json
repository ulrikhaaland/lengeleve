They both have symptoms that include coughing and sneezing and sore throat and muscle aches and pains and fever. However… This is in ADDITION to the flu. In the 50s, people were used to the flu so they sort of took it in stride. In 2009 with H1N1, it spread like crazy to 61 million people and started to stress the healthcare system but it has a case fatality rate of less than seasonal flu.

I’m a little more worried about our pandemic resiliency based on how badly we’ve handled a 1% case fatality rate, pandemic virus, where you’ve got cascading decisions by governors in States and countries all around the world that really have magnified the damage that the virus has done.

They’re happening in healthcare facilities have poor infection control and it doesn’t really sustain itself in the human population. Whereas if you look at the other four coronaviruses, the ones that cause common colds, they are ubiquitous. They transmit very easy. They have a mild spectrum of illness which allows people to go about their daily life and spread, and this new novel coronavirus does appear to be more like them in terms of their transmissibility.

There clearly is a severity bias in who gets tested… which leads to a number like 15 to 20% getting admitted to the hospital. Amesh says the real hospitalization rate is probably closer to 5%.
