  "content": "Problems with the current 10-year risk assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the implications for prevention. Atherosclerosis, it’s a disease in the tissue, yet almost everything that lipid people talk about is in plasma. One must understand the natural history of the disease to learn how to construct a strategy to prevent it. Although much of the work has been on apoB, the more important part has been on understanding how the natural history of atherosclerosis should direct a prevention strategy.",

  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Every major guideline in the world bases their selection of subjects for statin prevention on the ten-year risk of disease. This fundamentally makes prevention of premature disease almost impossible. When one plugs in the numbers to calculate a patient’s risk for any of the risk algorithms, one expects the output to be the patient’s risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but it isn’t. The calculation is driven by the age and sex of the patient. Things like cholesterol and blood pressure contribute minimally to the actual calculation of ten-year risk.",

  "content": "Stary and colleagues established that for the first three decades or so of life, the disease gets a foothold in the artery, but it’s only in the fourth decade that one starts to develop the lesions that can actually precipitate a clinical event. Risk is low, yet the event rate is high. There are a ton more people under 60 than over 60; so the rate of events is low, but the absolute number of events is high.",

  "content": "A 30-year model of risk that focuses on cause of CVD has been developed. With a measure of non-HDL or apoB, risk can be projected for over 20-30 years. For a 30-year-old, the period of time they should care about is up to at least 60. This model could predict that a 35-year-old has a 30% chance of stroke before age 65.",

Looking at their coronary arteries, one realizes they already have atherosclerosis; they have oxidized apoB-bearing particles engulfed by macrophages and thickened intima.",
