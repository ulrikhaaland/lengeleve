  "content": "The current 10-year risk assessment of cardiovascular disease has flaws, including that it makes prevention of premature disease almost impossible. The calculation is driven by the age and sex of the patient, and things like cholesterol and blood pressure contribute minimally to the actual calculation of ten-year risk. Risk is low, yet the event rate is high, and there are two fatal flaws in the 10-year risk approach.",

  "content": "The two fatal flaws in the 10-year risk approach are that there are a ton more people under 60 than over 60, so the rate of events is low, but the absolute number of events is high, and by the time a doctor tries to prevent an event, the disease is well advanced in the arteries.",

  "content": "If one algorithm said a patient has a 10% risk and another one said a patient has a 15% or 20%, whether they have an infarct or not, both algorithms were right because they said there was sort of a chance the patient would have an infarct. There is also a far greater chance that the patient won’t have an infarct. When the advice is to treat patients with a risk above 7.5%, that means 92.5% of the time nothing will happen to these patients. That’s not a great incentive for helping people understand what’s truly going to happen.",

With a measure of non-HDL or apoB, risk can be projected for over 20-30 years. For a 30-year-old, the period of time they should care about is up to at least 60. For example, this model could predict that a 35-year-old has a 30% chance of stroke before age 65. Now a second calculation can be made to determine how much the risk can be reduced by starting treatment at age 35 or how much the patient would lose by starting at age 45 or age 55.",

  "content": "When Allan gave Peter the book on atherosclerosis he was starting his own journey on trying to construct an alternative to the present risk model in which with the help of my colleague here at McGill, George Thanassoulis, and Michael Pencina from Duke, and Karol Pencina from Harvard we have done. Published in JAMA Cardiology in 2017, The Benefit Model for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease: An Opportunity to Harmonize Guidelines. Peter remembers from pathology class in med school something the professor said, “No doctor has more experience with what it is to have heart attacks than pathologists because 50% of the people who have a heart attack die on their first heart attack.“ The textbook went through, in great detail, the pathological staging of atherosclerosis; it was also littered with autopsy sections of coronary arteries from people who had died for other reasons. Notably, many of these people who died from other causes, but their coronary arteries were studied in autopsy, these people were quite young. A 26-year-old male victim of a gunshot wound; or a 27-year-old female who died in a motor vehicle accident, etc. Looking at their coronary arteries, one realizes they already have atherosclerosis; they have oxidized apoB-bearing particles engulfed by macrophages and thickened intima. While they may not have calcification in their arteries yet or the types of plaque that would rupture within the ensuing weeks or days or months, they nevertheless had atherosclerosis. Now what Peter’s professor said some 20 years earlier made sense.",

A lesion in the left anterior descending artery. “Well, there’s an LAD lesion, but the whole damn artery is diseased. And when you destroy the normal architecture of the artery, you can’t restore it.” – Allan Sniderman. Much of statin prevention therapy is to prevent complication of disease not actually prevent disease. Statins lower apoB particle number; that’s how they work. With fewer apoB particles in plasma, fewer get into the arterial wall, fewer get trapped.",
