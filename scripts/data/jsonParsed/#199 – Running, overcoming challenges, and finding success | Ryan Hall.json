With this new nutrition by mile 23 he is completely out of it; he needed sugar stat. His protein bar hardly has any carbs in it. At a support tent (which was unmanned) they had laid out dried fruit and candy. He crawls in there and grabs as much candy as he can. He started feeling better immediately.",

He ended up walking the back half of that marathon. When they landed in Sydney he tries to stand and put weight on the leg where the hip was bothering him and the pain took his breath away. The pain was super sharp. He knew he was in trouble. He had a hard time putting any weight on it at all.",

But then, it’s been such a beautiful transition though of realizing that that whole season was about seeing how good he could get. Since then he’s realized it wasn’t just for him. Everything he’s learned in that season was meant to be passed down. It was meant to be shared and meant to help other people. This launched him into the season coaching. He’s far more concerned with his athletes happiness than with how fast they are.",
