Peter knows right now he could not go out and run 800 meters, half a mile at that pace. Peter used to have a sign in his office, it was a pace clock that said 4:42. Many, many years ago, they had a treadmill set up to that pace [12.76 mph]. The idea was they had random people show up and run, to see how long they could sustain that pace. They would put a harness around a person’s waist and they’d make them run at 4:42. And these people were getting shot off the back of this treadmill after 30 seconds, 40 seconds, one person made it a minute. Right? The reason Peter put this sign up in his office was because he was put off by the notion that people would say, “Hey man, we’re training for a marathon, not a sprint”. He tried to make the point that if someone wants to win a marathon, it feels like sprinting. It’s one thing to go out and run a marathon and take hours to do it. It’s another thing to go out and win a marathon. If someone is trying to win a marathon, they have to understand the pain that these guys are in.

The reason is their ground contact time is way too long and they dissipate too much force. You want to be under 0.28 seconds of ground contact time. This is interesting not because he’s interested in running fast, but because he’s interested in his feet becoming very good at load dissipation and load transfer and force transfer.
