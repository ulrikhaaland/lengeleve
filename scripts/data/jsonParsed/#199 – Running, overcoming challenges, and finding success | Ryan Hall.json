  "content": "Peter recalls that Ryan had a pretty good run in Beijing; he finished 10th. Yea, but for Ryan it wasn’t about what place he finished, it was the sensation of clicking. He wrote a book about that whole experience, so much went into that. Running with Joy: My Daily Journey to the Marathon (published in 2011). But it was also that he wasn’t clicking in training. When things are clicking he feels like Tigger, just bounding along as effortless like, “this is going to be fun…you’re kind of licking your chops”. He didn’t take a big break after running 2:06 at the London Marathon in April 2008. He didn’t take his customary 2 week break where he would put on 10 lbs and not run at all. So then he was just flat for the whole build up to Beijing; he wasn’t right going into that race. It’s interesting talking to scientist at the Olympic training center, prepping for the race. Talking about how hot and humid it’s going to be. This was one of those big life learning experiences for him, where the storyline is— it’s going to be so hot and humid, it’s going to be slow. The race will be won in 2:12, 2:11. They just hearing this story over and over again. He didn’t do what he learned to do after that, which is, “You got to be like the Samurai… you got to be ready for any situation that’s going to come and not expect anything”. “Expect nothing, be ready for anything” – Ryan Hall. He wasn’t in that state of mind, he was thought it was going to be chill for the first mile. Right from the gun, Sammy’s just gone; the guy who ended up winning the gold medal. He just took it out super hard. Mentally, Ryan got hit in the chin with an uppercut, right out of the gate because he wasn’t ready for that scenario at all. So then he got back and was in 60th place and he’s trying to win a medal but thinking, “You don’t win a medal from 60th place”. A lot of competing well in anything is getting excited while you’re out there – Ryan Hall. One has to be holding this snowball of excitement as the race is playing out. He was having the opposite experience of that. He was not where he wanted to be. He was too far back; he couldn’t even see the leaders; the he helicopter was way off in the distance. He had to coach himself through that. And actually how he did that was by encouraging other guys around home, which isn’t a normal tactic. But as he encouraged other people, it encouraged himself.",

  "content": "Peter used to have a sign in his office, it was a pace clock that said 4:42. Many, many years ago, they had a treadmill set up to that pace [12.76 mph]. The idea was they had random people show up and run, to see how long they could sustain that pace. They would put a harness around a person’s waist and they’d make them run at 4:42. And these people were getting shot off the back of this treadmill after 30 seconds, 40 seconds, one person made it a minute. Right? The reason Peter put this sign up in his office was because he was put off by the notion that people would say, “Hey man, we’re training for a marathon, not a sprint”. He tried to make the point that if someone wants to win a marathon, it feels like sprinting. It’s one thing to go out and run a marathon and take hours to do it. It’s another thing to go out and win a marathon. If someone is trying to win a marathon, they have to understand the pain that these guys are in. They have to understand what 4:42 means; it is insanity. For Ryan, it’s below his threshold, but his threshold is so high. For Peter, looking at Meb win that race, having seen him in the months prior, running so fast doing tempo repeats while Peter was on his bike, it is really amazing.",

He was coming up over Heartbreak Hill and he remembers just yelling at the spectators on the side, asking how Meb was doing when he came past. And they were like, “He was winning when he came past”. Ryan knew if Meb got over Heartbreak Hill in the lead, he was going to win that thing; that was special. Peter notes, it’s hard to believe this was 2014, it was one of those races that is seared into his mind. He remembers it well because he trained at the same place as Meb in San Diego, at Fiesta Island; that’s where all the cycling time trial races are held. Peter would train at Fiesta Island 3-4 days a week; it’s 7 Km and perfectly flat. Meb would do his tempo runs there.

  "content": "2 days before a marathon, he’s carbo-loading. The nutritionist he worked with advised him to spread the load out so he wouldn’t feel bloated and terrible the day before the race. He would eat 400 calories of extra carbohydrates for 2 days before the race. Those carbs would be super simple. He wanted to make it easy on his system. He would eat white rice, pasta; he really liked sourdough bread because of its lower glycemic index and it digests easily. Maltodextrin is a carb he likes to take in; it’s a tasteless, liquid calorie. He can mix it with protein powder, shake it up, and shoot it down. But you has to be careful, he’s had some bad experiences with other branded stuff. His pre-race meal was a liquid meal because he would wake up really full from all the carb loading he had done the day before. 3 hours before the race he would shake liquid maltodextrin with protein powder, and add a little bit of olive oil as a health fat to help slow things down a little. He would take a gel right on the starting line. He would be sipping on a water bottle the whole time. He would be able to put a water bottle on a table every 5K. These would start off dilute and get increasingly concentrated as the race went on. The reason for this is that the body absorbs things more easily when it’s not tired. He wanted to make sure he was front loading his carbon intake during the marathon because the body can process it a lot easier. When you’re 40K into a marathon, you don’t feel like taking in carbs at all. Often he would take a swig of a water bottle and spit it out; it tricks the body into thinking it’s getting carbs but it doesn’t get anything. This would give a little jolt of energy with just 2K to go. He would have a gel at 15K; at 30K he would have a caffeinated gel. He would time his caffeine intake to where he was taking it 75 minutes prior to the start of the race. Caffeine is really interesting; when it came on board he couldn’t imagine doing a race without it. There was no going back. He is 100% faster with caffeine on board than without it.",

  "content": "Peter asks if he ever experimented with Tylenol. No, Ryan never did. Peter was talking to Lance Armstrong about it a couple weeks ago and this came up. He never used Tylenol in the tour but it’s a pretty remarkable performance enhancing drug. Perfectly legal. It gives a 1-2% boost. It’s not clear if this comes through temperature reduction of pain reduction. Peter used it during time trials. A time trial is basically an hour of threshold; it’s super painful. Sometimes he felt like he even gained 3% from Tylenol. Peter would take 1000 mg before a race. He’s curious if other athletes have tried it. Ryan is not familiar with it but is definitely going to try it with his athletes now. Peter notes, Tylenol reduces pain in a way that is different from NSAIDs. One  needs to be careful with the dose because it’s a very liver toxic drug at high doses. But in normal amounts, 1000 mg is incredibly safe. Ryan asks if there is any application to lifting. If it keeps the core temperature down, it seems like that would be helpful. Peter hasn’t seen any literature on lifting with Tylenol. Funny story, about 8 years ago Peter saw some papers that looked at how Viagra improved lifting. So he tried it but couldn’t use Viagra because of the symptoms he was getting. It’s a vasodilator; his blood pressure isn’t high but is kind of low so he would get light-headed using it. But research shows that 25-50 mg of Viagra boosts muscle endurance and performance.",

  "content": "Keeping the core temperature cool can boost performance. Ryan asks if Peter has played at all with palm cooling. Peter used to check his core temperature before and after long swims because he had the opposite problem. Sometimes he would actually swim with a rectal probe just to see. Too much or too little temp is pretty bad. Ryan mentions Dr. Huberman, a Stanford neuroscientist who studies palm cooling. There is some pretty remarkable research about this and its effects on strength training and endurance. The best way to lower cort temp is through one’s face, the upper face where there is no hair. The next best is through the hands and bottoms of the feet. They developed this glove to dump heat. It’s not icy cold, just cool. One doesn’t want it too cold. It doesn’t change vasodilation. It dumps heat and brings the core temperature down. Ryan has been playing a little with holding a cold pack in his hands between lifts or putting his hands in cool water to dump his temp. If one can keep their temperatures in an optimal range, in theory, it should increase their endurance. Peter has tried a cooling helmet. The helmet had gel pack inserts that could be frozen in the freezer. When he would ride his trainer wearing this cooling helmet, it definitely made a difference. He couldn’t bring himself to use it in a race. Many people invest in a cooling vest; it’s a vest that runs ice water around one’s torso. Finally Peter got one and it was a game changer. Ryan is interested in this because he plays around with a cooling vest too. He has an archaic one that he freezes then it slowly gets back to temperature. Peter notes this would not be great for a runner because it would be too heavy. In a car, it’s an enormous performance booster. Using the cooling vest made a difference in how tired he felt after the race. It was the difference between feeling like one was going to die and feeling tired but okay. Peter can see how cooling could be used in strength training but wonders how it could be incorporated into a marathon. Ryan thinks cooling would be useful before a race when the athlete is warming-up, doing drills and strides. In interval training, cooling could be done between sets. He’ll use a bucket of cold water at the track for the athletes to put their hands in inbetween sets. He has used those instant cold packs; break them open and hold them for about 2 minutes. It’s kind of a hindrance, but it’s worth it to get the performance benefit.",

This allows one to stress the body, then rest the body (keep repeating the cycle). The body will adapt. Peter agrees; proper training is one thing he spends a lot of time talking about with patients. Most people are training in this garbage zone where it’s too high in intensity to build a true aerobic foundation, and too low in intensity to truly stress the body glycolytically. Then at the other end of the spectrum, there’s got to be this real push pace, a 4 by  4 pace. 4 on and 4 off.

Generally speaking, whatever you can run for that 15 mile threshold, you can hold for a marathon. The long run occurs when there is already a little bit of fatigue in the legs. Sometimes he would run over the marathon distance. These are high quality efforts. Oftentimes its at a medium pace, 6-minute mile for the first half and slower on the second half.",

He went in with the same attitude he had for his 15 mile run around Big Bear. He wanted to go out with a bang. “I never got to say goodbye to the sport. It’s like, I just faded out. And all of a sudden I was gone and my body wasn’t able to run.” – Ryan  Hall. This was his chance to say goodbye to the sport that he loved. The last marathon was at Manly beach. They did a mile out, mile back for the whole marathon. It was sick, the beach was lit up by the moon and the stars. They were running at 1:00 am for some reason. He would have rather gotten more sleep. He thinks Richard scheduled the run at night was to give people enough time to finish. He needed the extra time that day. He got a massage in the middle of the run. When he got home and had a MRI he found out he had a stress reaction in his hip. Massages aren’t the best for a stress reaction. He’ll never forget coming across that finish line. The sun was up. It took him 5.5 hours. It was the longest, slowest, most painful marathon. Every time he put his leg down on that concrete he felt the zing of a super sharp pain. But after running 6 marathons in a row he was like, “I’m doing whatever it takes to get through this seventh one. I’m not stopping now and never signing up for this trip again. So I got to get it done.” He came across the finish line, took off his shoes and left them there.",

What’s cool about it is that it doesn’t matter what level you run at. We all get to experience that when you sign up for any race. You’re out there with a 50,000 amazing people that are on a journey with you. We get to do it together.",

  "content": "That whole sentiment just hit him super hard; saying goodbye to the sport he loves. But then, it’s been such a beautiful transition though of realizing that that whole season was about seeing how good he could get. Since then he’s realized it wasn’t just for him. Everything he’s learned in that season was meant to be passed down. It was meant to be shared and meant to help other people. This launched him into the season coaching. Coaching his wife, coaching other athletes in person. He started Run Free Training where he coaches runners of every single discipline. Every level. Super slow people. Middle school kids. Because it doesn’t matter where you’re at, we just want to be on the journey with you and we want to guide you and help you on your journey.",

And hopefully they won’t make the same mistakes and they’ll be better off for it. That is his goal now— how he can help people. Not just with running but with living. Living happier. He’s far more concerned with his athletes happiness than with how fast they are. “I want them to enter into the good life. And I think running is a way to do that. Lifting can be a way to do that, it adds to that, but more than anything I just want them to find joy.” – Ryan Hall.",

Peter has only been there once, but it’s still one of the most significant things he’s ever done. When he was there, he made it a hiking / swimming trip. He swam in the Colorado river and then in each of the waterfalls on the way up. There are thes 4 huge waterfalls that get progressively smaller as you go up.",
