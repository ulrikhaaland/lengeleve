Peter is concerned we could be lulled into a false sense of confidence. To date, most coronaviruses cause a bunch of colds. Then a couple bad actors showed up (SARS and MERS) that can really hurt their host, but they’re nothing to really be afraid of because: i) It can’t bounce back and forth between humans and animals, ii) You’re very unlikely to spread it if you’re not symptomatic, iii) you can just isolate people when they’re sick and treat them before they treat others. *None of this is true with SARS-2/COVID-19. “I don’t think there’s anything that’s unlikely.” says Stanley. “SARS-CoV-2 is like a mixture of the common cold coronavirus, and then plus either SARS or MERS coronavirus in the lungs.” It’s the same thing that SARS-CoV-2 does in the lungs in those people who get severe disease. We think that there’s two main features: i) there’s lots of virus in the lungs, and ii) there’s a very strong and probably inappropriate immune response that’s causing much of the damage that we see in lungs. SARS-CoV-2 infects both the upper and lower airway. The upper airway infection of SARS-CoV-2 could account for the high transmissibility of COVID-19 and the lower airway infection increases its lethality.",

Because that person, if you saw signs of things going badly, perhaps it would warrant the use of… Remdesivir, for example, to stop the virus in its tracks, or an immune activator if appropriate. But.. “We’re not there yet in terms of thinking about which markers are best.”",

  "content": "For the tens of millions (perhaps hundreds of millions) of people who have been infected with COVID-19, what is going to be the durability of their immunity to getting reinfection? We can make progress in our understanding of this question by measuring their antibody responses and their T-cell responses. Stanley says that the most likely answer is that we’re going to see waning immunity with people with mild disease (like we see for the common cold coronavirus infections). What will a successful vaccine look like? There’s two goals for a vaccine: 1—To protect the individual who’s vaccinated from getting severe pneumonia (actually, that may occur already … people who had a mild case may not be immune to reinfection but they may be immune to an infection that gives them severe pneumonia) 2—How much immunity do you need to prevent transmissibility to other people? This may be the most important question, not to the individual, but to society",

  "content": "In the case where SARS-CoV-2 can’t be fully eradicated, how do we coexist with this virus moving forward? This question becomes even more relevant if vaccines are somewhat risky. Everything is going to be a risk tradeoff and it may be that you don’t not want to vaccinate everybody with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine if the risk is slightly higher than we deem acceptable. This generates a situation that warrants a cost-benefit analysis.",

  "content": "Will herd immunity even be possible if immunity to SARS-CoV-2 goes away after a year? That’s really the key question, says Stanley. One possibility is that you may see an ability to get reinfected but the reinfection will only produce a common cold and no pneumonia (but that would require a mutation that may not be likely). And furthermore, for those hypothetical people who are reinfected, what is their level of shedding (i.e., transmissibility)? The simplest study would be to take some human volunteers, give them a common cold coronavirus and then a year later come back reintroduce the same virus and see if: i) do they get a cold? And ii) How much shedding do they have?",
