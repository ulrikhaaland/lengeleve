  "content": "High blood pressure seems to play a very important role in all the major chronic diseases, except for cancer. In neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renal disease (which are really the main pillars of death), hypertension seems to work against you. High blood pressure (aka primary or essential hypertension) is extraordinarily common in our country and throughout the world. Maybe 1/3 of adults have high blood pressure. High blood pressure is usually defined as a blood pressure greater than 140 over 90. In the US it was recently redefined as being greater than 130/80. Rick is a nephrologist, he takes care of the kidneys, the organ that is arguably the most sensitive to blood pressure (this is the first place where damage shows up). Rick notes there are 3 main sites where high blood pressure really causes problems: 1) Stroke— high blood pressure is a major cause of stroke, 2) Heart failure— it’s a major cause of heart failure, 3) Kidney disease— it’s one of the 2 major causes of kidney disease. These are all pressure related conditions where the higher the pressure the higher the risk of these diseases.",
