  "content": "High blood pressure contributes to many chronic diseases, playing a significant role in all the major chronic diseases, except for cancer. It is extraordinarily common, with maybe 1/3 of adults having high blood pressure. High blood pressure is usually defined as a blood pressure greater than 140 over 90, but in the US it was recently redefined as being greater than 130/80. There are 3 main sites where high blood pressure really causes problems: stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease. These are all pressure related conditions where the higher the pressure the higher the risk of these diseases.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Studies show that the greatest risk for these diseases occurs when the systolic blood pressure is 160-180 or higher. There is a linear relationship between blood pressure and the risk of stroke and heart failure going all the way down to 120/80. Most studies done in around 1900 showed that less than 5% of the population had blood pressures of over 140 over 90. Based upon the normal Gaussian curve of the population back then, probably about 140 over 90 was the cutoff for what was thought to be high blood pressure.",
