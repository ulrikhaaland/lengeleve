  "content": "An article in the New England Journal of Medicine discussed the effect of vitamin D supplementation on fracture risk. The study utilized data from a 5-year, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial of over 18,000 participants. The investigators concluded that supplementation with vitamin D did not have a significant effect on mood or depressive symptoms. Another study published in the NEJM utilized data from the same trial, this time tracking the incidence of bone fractures among nearly 26,000 participants over the 5-year follow-up period. The study aimed to assess whether vitamin D supplementation reduced risk of incident fractures. For vitamin D supplementation to have any effect relative to placebo, it needs to be increasing the body’s supply of vitamin D. The researchers relied on self-reporting questionnaires to assess supplementation adherence and the outcome of interest was also measured by self-report, with participants reporting fractures in annual questionnaires. The vitamin D group was given a dose of 2000 IU/day. A sizable subset of participants took vitamin D supplements outside of the study directives, especially among the placebo group.",

  "content": "The NEJM study did not limit their analysis to those with low baseline vitamin D levels. Individuals are generally considered deficient in vitamin D if circulating levels are below 20 ng/mL, and only about 13% of study participants met this definition at the start of the study. The authors stratified participants into quartiles based on baseline vitamin D levels, and their results demonstrated no significant differences in fracture risk between quartiles. However, the data did show a trend toward highest risk among the lowest quartile (vitamin D ≤24 ng/mL) and lowest risk among the highest quartile (vitamin D ≥37 ng/mL).",
