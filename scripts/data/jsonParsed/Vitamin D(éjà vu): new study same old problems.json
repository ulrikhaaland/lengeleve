  "content": "The NEJM study published two weeks ago utilized data from the VITAL trial, tracking the incidence of bone fractures among nearly 26,000 participants over the 5-year follow-up period. The study aimed to assess whether vitamin D supplementation reduced risk of incident fractures, but the underlying question, then, is whether vitamin D levels in the body are inversely associated with fracture risk. Vitamin D was measured in fewer than 25% of participants at follow-up, and only a fraction of those participants had also provided baseline samples for comparison (~10% of the total study population).",

  "content": "The NEJM study did not limit their analysis to those with low baseline vitamin D levels. Individuals are generally considered deficient in vitamin D if circulating levels are below 20 ng/mL, and only about 13% of study participants met this definition at the start of the study.",

  "content": "The vitamin D group was given a dose of 2000 IU/day. With pre- and post-treatment comparison from only 10% of participants, we just can’t be sure that this dose was sufficient to raise vitamin D to a clinically meaningful level above the placebo group. In our practice we do not supplement with a dose of 2000 IU. Either we don’t supplement at all (if we levels are adequate) or we supplement with 5000 IU if supplementation is warranted.",
