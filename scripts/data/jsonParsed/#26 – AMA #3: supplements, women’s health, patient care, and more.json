Did this for about a year, didn’t tell anyone, because he figured that if there truly were noticeable differences and wanted to see if others noticed on their own. The first person to notice was Peter’s wife, she noticed after 4 months. When Peter asked how she knew, her response was, “You’re less of an asshole”. Peter decided not to continue to take a mega dose of lithium (he did notice some side effects such as nausea). Peter now takes low dose 10-20 mg lithium. He categorizes this as “probably not harmful, [but] not sure how much value I’m getting out of it”.",

Secondly, the more exciting piece is that it is a weak inhibitor of the enzyme, PCSK9. Word on the street, it probably only works in a subset of people who overexpress PCSK9 (an enzyme [technically a proprotein convertase: it acts more like a chaperone than a catalytic enzyme] that degrades LDL receptors) which ends up in higher LDL-P (only about 5% of the time will this be the reason someone isn’t clearing LDL particles, there are literally thousands of possible reasons).

  "content": "But the reason he was doing so is that heart disease is rampant in Peter’s family so he is simply trying to mitigate risk. Baby aspirin has some effect on inflammation, but the majority of the benefit is on platelets, therefore reducing thrombotic events (blood clot), which can be the final moment where you have an MI. A month ago, his view was . . . if your “Aspirin Works Test” is positive (test in urine that measures metabolites of platelets to predict which patients will respond to baby Aspirin) combined with at least one other factor that indicates possible heart disease, he would recommend taking it. There are side effects to be considered, easier bruising, bleeding, a small risk of ulcer, etc. Study that came out recently that looked at relatively low-risk populations, found that the risk of taking baby aspirin was small, but so was the benefit, making it a “wash” in Peter’s mind. Now he’s just a little less likely to suggest (this especially to low risk patients). Will Peter stop taking it? Perhaps, even though it makes sense intuitively, the data simply don’t support it.",

They developed a tracer to track all the intermediaries of NAD and all the precursors. When given oral precursors (NR or NMN), only the liver could take them up and make NAD using tryptophan, no other cell could take it up. So if you’re taking oral NR or NMN, you are pretty much just giving it to your liver, not the place you want it to be (not changed by using pterostilbene). Based on data, only way to increase cellular NAD would be intravenous doses of NR or NMN. Taking it orally is probably not harmful, but probably waste of money.
