  "content": "Alzheimer’s disease is associated with the APOE4 variant. There are a lot of genes that seem to modify the risk of APOE. APOE has three subtypes, e2, e3, and e4. Everyone has a pair meaning there are six possible combinations. The fourth isoform (e4) is the high risk one. The e3/e4 seems to be associated with about a 2x-3x increase in risk in Alzheimer’s disease. The e4/e4 probably has about an 8x-12x increase in risk. However, this doesn't explain what happens at the individual level. There are some individuals who walk around with e4/e4 who don’t seem to get Alzheimer’s disease or if they do, they get it very late in life.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There are a bunch of other genes that modify the risk of e4. Some genes make it more significant, some genes make it less. Certain haplotypes of the TOMM40 gene and certain mitochondrial haplotypes amplify risk. One of the most exciting genes is the Klotho modifier. KL-VS is the modified snip of klotho that actually seems to erase all of the downside of APOE4. APOE4 people who have this klotho subtype have baseline risk.",

A big step in the right direction here is going to be getting more data and getting those data for less than $20,000 per person.",
