There are some individuals who walk around with e4/e4 who don’t seem to get Alzheimer’s disease or if they do, they get it very late in life.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "It turns out that there are a bunch of other genes that we’re now starting to understand, modify the risk of e4 (some genes make it more significant, some genes make it less). So there are certain haplotypes of the TOMM40 gene that amplify risk. There are certain mitochondrial haplotypes that amplify risk. One of the most exciting genes is the Klotho modifier. KL-VS is the modified snip of klotho that actually seems to erase all of the downside of APOE4. So APOE4 people who have this klotho subtype have baseline risk.",

  "content": "Unfortunately the ways to measure these other genes, it’s very challenging and we have to do it by brute force today. it takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money to take a whole genome sequence and do the search for all of these other subtypes. A big step in the right direction here is going to be getting more data and getting those data for less than $20,000 per person. Probably sooner than 10 years from now. This is a solvable problem technically speaking, it’s just about throwing enough dollars at it.",
