  "content": "This recent study looked at the available data on cancer treatment outcomes for new cancer therapies approved by the FDA. It found 92 new FDA-approved cancer therapies for 100 indications over 17 years (between 2000 and 2016). About half (44 of 100) of the indications received FDA approval without supporting evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and the median absolute increase in overall survival was only 2 months. The cost of these drugs is high. The United States spends a high fraction of its GDP on healthcare.",

  "content": "This article explores questions about the nature of human perception compared to artificial intelligence (AI) we create. The NYT used AI to generate images of human faces that are indistinguishable from the actual faces of real people. Facial recognition programs have trouble identifying people with dark skin, and virtual assistants cannot understand speakers with foreign accents. Despite these flaws, humans seem to place disproportionately high trust in AI. Some overly trusting drivers actually drove into lakes as technology-induced awe overrode their common sense. AI embodies both the best and worst of what humans can create.",
