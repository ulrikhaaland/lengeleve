  "content": "This recent study looked at the available data on cancer treatment outcomes for new cancer therapies approved by the FDA. It found 92 new FDA-approved cancer therapies for 100 indications over 17 years (between 2000 and 2016). About half (44 of 100) of the indications received FDA approval without supporting evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and the median absolute increase in overall survival was only 2 months.",

  "content": "This fascinating article explores questions about the nature of human perception compared to artificial intelligence (AI) we create. The NYT used AI to generate images of human faces that are indistinguishable from the actual faces of real people. Even so, the article points out that, for all of technologyâ€™s successes, there are still discernible shortcomings. Despite these flaws, humans seem to place disproportionately high trust in AI.",
