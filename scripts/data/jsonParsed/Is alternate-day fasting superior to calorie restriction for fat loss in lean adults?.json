  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Researchers at the University of Bath conducted a 20-day randomized-controlled study in 36 lean healthy adults examining the effects on weight loss and metabolic health of three different food intake patterns: calorie restriction without fasting (CR), calorie restriction with alternate-day fasting (ADF+CR), and alternate-day fasting without calorie restriction (ADF). Participants were divided in a 1:1:1 ratio among the three feeding pattern protocols, which they began after a one-week washout period. All three groups lost weight after three weeks on their respective dietary protocols. The CR group not only experienced the greatest overall weight loss, but the weight loss in this group was almost entirely due to loss of fat mass. In contrast, more than half of the weight lost in the two ADF groups was attributed to fat-free mass. One possible explanation for the differences in fat loss between the CR and ADF+CR groups is a change in physical activity. The investigators observed significantly reduced physical activity in the ADF+CR group, which they primarily attributed to reduced spontaneous light- and moderate-intensity movements.",

  "content": "“Most significantly, if you are following a fasting diet it is worth thinking about whether prolonged fasting periods is actually making it harder to maintain muscle mass and physical activity levels,” says Betts, “which are known to be very important factors for long-term health.”",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Another factor to consider is that this was a study in “lean” adults, and it is possible that results would be different if the investigators included people who actually need to lose weight. The length of the intervention needs to be taken into consideration as well.",

  "context": "Fasting",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "What if participants were prescribed these diet patterns for 1-2 years instead of three weeks? We might see different results, especially when we consider relative differences in how easily each of these patterns can be sustained over time. In this context, I agree with the lead investigator’s statement about considering the approach that you can sustain while maintaining physical activity.",

  "context": "Fasting",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "This study challenges the common belief that alternate-day fasting results in greater loss of fat mass and improvement in metabolic parameters than a diet equal in calorie content but consumed in a more consistent pattern. However, limitations in the study duration and participant population leave room for the possibility that diet intake patterns may have more profound effects over longer periods of time and/or in individuals with greater fat mass at baseline.",
