  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Benoît turned 40 this year and had his lipids checked and Lp(a) remeasured. His Lp(a) is very high, 200 mmolar. He had his genotype done by a direct-to-consumer company that lets you look at your own data. They send you all of your SNP information. He looked at his favorite SNP in his Lp(a) gene and discovered he is a carrier of one of the most famous Lp(a) variants. His LDL is a bit higher than average, his Lp(a) is high, so he began to take a statin. He’s been on a close to vegetarian diet for more than 3 years, he’s physically active. But looking at his labs, he wants to do more. “I see the importance of going after LDL very early and very aggressively”— Benoît Arsenault. He’s not on a super high dose statin, but will check it after 3 months. If his LDL doesn’t go down, he will increase the dose. This is what he thinks people with high Lp(a) should do.",
