  "content": "The approach to managing patients with high Lp(a) involves a 2-pronged approach to lipid management. The first step is to eradicate apoB to a physiologic level, the level a child has. The targets for apoB is to get it down to 30-40 mg/dL without side effects from medication. The second step is to use PCSK9 inhibitors to reduce Lp(a), on average by 30%.",

  "content": "Upon turning 40 and having lipids checked and Lp(a) remeasured, it was found that the Lp(a) level was very high, at 200 mmolar. A genotype was done by a direct-to-consumer company that lets you look at your own data. The LDL was a bit higher than average, and the Lp(a) was high, so a statin was started. Despite being on a close to vegetarian diet for more than 3 years and being physically active, the labs indicated a need for more action. The importance of going after LDL very early and very aggressively was noted. The statin dose was not super high, but it would be checked after 3 months. If the LDL doesnâ€™t go down, the dose would be increased. This is what is recommended for people with high Lp(a).",
