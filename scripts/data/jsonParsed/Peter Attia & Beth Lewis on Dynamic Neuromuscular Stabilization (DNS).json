  "content": "Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS) is based on a re-engineering of the development of movement patterns that occurs between three months of age and walking. The idea of that we are born with the innate ability to move efficiently, but by the time kids are school age (6) they are sitting all day and starting to lose the natural movement patterns.
