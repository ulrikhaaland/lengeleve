  "content": "A couple of unrelated events over the past few months have led me to view 2020 as a year to implement some new routines around my mental and emotional health. I read (and then reread) Ryan Holiday’s exceptional book Stillness is the Key. It really resonated, especially the second time, as I was in a place to be more willing to hear the message: no matter how busy or productive we are, and frankly, the busier and more productive we aspire to be, the more we need periods of true stillness. Furthermore, there is no better place to find stillness than in nature. To that end, walking (in nature) with zero agenda—not doing so to “get a workout” or “see something” specific—may be one of the best tools for finding this elusive state.",

  "content": "This year I am going to change my fasting regimen from 7 days of water-only fasting per quarter to 3 days of water only per month. One of my goals for this year is to lose 7 pounds. This target would still have me weighing 10-11 lb more than when I was most recently a cyclist (circa 2012-2014), but I do think it will be a lot of work for me to get and stay there. How do I plan to achieve this? In my case, I think it will come down to being consistent with the following: No snacking (even “healthy” snacking), especially after dinner. Stop eating food off my kids’ plates. Maybe consider a week of keto each month.",

  "content": "I’m going to bump up my zone 2 (for an explanation of what this is, check out this podcast) from 3 or 3.5 hours/week to 4 hours/week. That’s the main addition. The other elements of exercise—strength, stability, and anaerobic performance—I’ll continue to push on as I did in 2019. In particular, I’m probably most excited about my progress on deadlifts, which has been helped greatly courtesy of Beth Lewis, who has forced me to do one workout per week of light straight-bar deadlifts in exceptionally strict form.",

  "content": "The biggest change in my sleep over the past few months, which I plan to stick with, is basically moving to an earlier bedtime and wake-up time. It’s not uncommon for me to go to bed at 8 pm and wake up at 4 am. I find it’s very important to be as consistent as possible with this. Now, on a weekend I might push to 9 to 5, but no more than 10 to 6.",
