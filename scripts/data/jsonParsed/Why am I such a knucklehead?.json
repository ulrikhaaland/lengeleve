  "content": "During boxing days, there was an obsession with cracking knuckles. An interesting article from the New York Times (2018) explains that researchers created a mathematical model of a cracking knuckle, suggesting that the sound arises from the popping of a bubble in the joint. As for potential harm, a 2011 case-control study examined the hand radiographs of 215 people and found no difference between those who cracked their knuckles and those who didn't, regardless of how many years or how often a person cracked their knuckles. It has also been suggested that people who crack their knuckles were more likely to have lower grip strength, but recent experiments appear to refute this.",
