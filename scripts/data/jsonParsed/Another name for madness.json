I Would Have Driven Her Anywhere: Caring for a mother who suffers from dementia was really hard. Alzheimer’s disease often doesn’t just strike one person.

The recent announcement by Sandra Day O’Connor that she has dementia, and by others noted in the article, should help remove the stigma associated with the disease.",

As my friend and colleague Richard Isaacson (he’s the director of an Alzheimer’s prevention clinic) put it, Alzheimer’s is a “terrible, terrible, terrible, horrible disease.” But like Richard, I’m optimistic that there are things we can do to lower the risk of it.",
