  "content": "Update on Dom’s Press-pulse therapeutic strategy for the metabolic management of cancer. The idea of using ketone metabolic therapy (or therapeutic ketosis) and other modalities to compromise tumor growth and proliferation. This weakens the tumor making it more susceptible to be killed by other modalities. Being in a state of therapeutic ketosis suppresses insulin signaling, which drives PI-3 kinase, lowers glucose availability to the tumor, elevates ketone bodies which can not be readily utilized by most cancers as a source of fuel. Ketones also impair antioxidant pathways that the tumors use to defend itself.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Potential role for vitamin C in cancer treatment. Most people think of vitamin C as an antioxidant but high concentrations of vitamin C can be a prooxidant–making it relevant in cancer treatment. Adding HBOT during radiation therapy kills cancer cells by 80 to 90% just through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation because they are toxic tumor cells. The efficacy of radiation therapy is directly proportional to the pO2 of the tumor—so if you oxygenate the tumor and then radiate it there is a greater burst of intratumor ROS. Tumors tend to grow and outstrip their blood supply, so they’re hypoxic, making them resistant to radiation. So adding HBOT during radiation would dramatically sensitize it.",
