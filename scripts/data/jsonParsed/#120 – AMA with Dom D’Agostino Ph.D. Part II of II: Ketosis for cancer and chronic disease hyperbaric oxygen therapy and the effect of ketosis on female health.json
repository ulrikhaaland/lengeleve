  "content": "The idea of using ketone metabolic therapy (or therapeutic ketosis) and other modalities to compromise tumor growth and proliferation. This weakens the tumor making it more susceptible to be killed by other modalities. Example, the ketogenic diet combined with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Being in a state of therapeutic ketosis suppresses insulin signaling, which drives PI-3 kinase, lowers glucose availability to the tumor, and elevates ketone bodies which can not be readily utilized by most cancers as a source of fuel. Ketones also impair antioxidant pathways that the tumors use to defend itself (e.g., the pentose phosphate pathway generates more glutathione in cancer cells and that is being fed by glucose). In summary—if you reduce glucose availability and inhibit insulin, which suppresses glycolysis, you’re creating a scenario where if you give an oxidative challenge with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, you can potentially kill the cancer cells. The ketogenic diet and hyperbaric oxygen therapy prolong survival in mice with systemic metastatic cancer. Many different things that you can combine in press-pulse therapy. A weakened tumor from therapeutic ketosis may be more vulnerable to a number of other cancer specific metabolic drugs—PI3K inhibitors, 2-Deoxy-d-glucose, 3-Bromopyruvate (3BP), Dichloroacetate (DCA), Metformin, Vitamin C at high doses, and SGLT2 inhibitors.",

Tumors tend to grow and outstrip their blood supply, so they’re hypoxic, making them resistant to radiation. So adding HBOT during radiation would dramatically sensitize it. After having hyperbaric oxygen therapy, you’ll have a residual elevation of reactive oxygen species for hours after. And it’ll be somewhat site-specific increase in reactive oxygen species, because various mitochondrial abnormalities. There’s a debate whether the mitochondria are damaged or they are not damaged.",

Lowering of many of the amino acids and associated anabolic signals that can drive tumor growth. You do all that and cripple antioxidant defenses by reducing pentose phosphate pathway activity. It’s possible to “set the stage” nicely for an oxidative stress stimulus that could kill the cancer — therapies like: A drug therapy — with PI 3-kinase drug, you get results, but it’s nothing like if you start the diet a week or two before. Hyperbaric oxygen. IV vitamin C (functions as a pro-oxidant). Chemotherapy—which is a form of metabolic therapy, since you’re inhibiting the formation of molecules and crippling the mitochondria to some extent and their ability to make ATP. Radiation (kills cancer primarily through  oxidative stress). IV vitamin C hyperbaric oxygen, and, of course, radiation and chemo (combined). Many chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells through a redox mechanism… Metformin, for example, has anticancer effects which are linked mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production. 3BP—a promising agent in cancer therapy. Dom calls 3BP—a hexokinase-2 inhibitor—an enormously promising agent. Detractors will says that 2-DG is cardiotoxic—which is true at high enough doses—but it also seems to have anticancer effects. Dom’s understanding is that for 3BP to have an anticancer effect and also to be nontoxic, it needs to be delivered in a very specific way, ideally site-specific in a liposomal preparation. But the waters have been muddied with a lot of competing interests and legal disputes (more about this in the book). Dom would love to include 3BP in his experiments in the future under the mentorship of Dr. Young Ko.

The low carb protocol is generally modeled after Richard Berstein’s book called Dr. Bernstein’s Diabetes Solution. Just under 50 grams per day of carbohydrates on average basically puts a type 1 diabetic’s hemoglobin A1C into nondiabetic range. It really crushes the glycemic variability. So you have far fewer hyperglycemic events and far fewer hypoglycemic events. And of course, a hypoglycemic event, if you’re on a normal diet could be deadly.

Oxidative stress specifically in the dopaminergic neuron population triggers apoptosis and programmed cell death. That can be mitigated in part by an optimal metabolic environment where the mitochondria is functioning efficiently. The function of the mitochondria and mitochondrial health are the ultimate mitigator of neurodegenerative diseases, probably Parkinson’s disease being at the top of that list, just by reducing the potential for reactive oxygen species related damage.",

  "content": "Recent animal study showed that an infusion of exogenous ketones suppressed luteinizing hormone (LH), and the response was dependent upon an increase in catecholamines. The implications may be that the ketone infusion—by decreasing LH and elevating ketones—this may help you get leaner, but it’s not going to help you maintain fertility. Ketones may be a signal to the body and the brain that it may not be the best time for child rearing—because if you have low resources (e.g., fasted) you’re going to be in a state of ketosis. Females that have metabolic syndrome and insulin resistant (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS) the ketogenic diet can restore their fertility and restore their hormonal balance.",

A 2005 study looked at fertility and women on low carb ketogenic diets—Two of the women were actually able to get pregnant after being infertile for a period of time. The effect of a low carb diet varies depending on the individual woman—Where they are in terms of metabolic health. The design of the diet—the macronutrient ratios, the source of fats and protein also make a difference. “There needs to be more data for sure. Some of the data indicates that it can be beneficial, especially in women that have metabolic syndrome.”",

  "content": "Be cautious using a purely ketogenic diet during pregnancy. Keto diets dramatically suppress insulin (a growth hormone), and can have great health consequences. However, during pregnancy you want to grow and do not want to impair growth of the developing fetus. In the case of a pregnant woman is obese or a type 2 diabetic, low-carb approach can be very powerful approach, says Dom. Postpartum—Dom has seen multiple examples of women who have trouble producing milk for breastfeeding while on a ketogenic diet—the suppression of insulin signaling for some reason is decreasing lactation and the ability to make milk. That said, Dom has received emails from women saying they had no problem breastfeeding while on a keto diet. So, issues with breastfeeding appears to happen in some percentage of women and not others.",

Dom’s thoughts on a higher protein approach for women with hormonal issues— hypothyroidism, peri- and post-menopause, amenorrhea, PCOS, etc. A lot of the issues and side effects that women are experiencing are probably from—Calorie restriction, Overexercising, And suppression of insulin signaling from calorie restriction plus carbohydrate restriction. The insulin suppression impact women more than men in terms of maintaining a hormone balance (especially with the sex hormones). Periodically increasing protein into your diet may be beneficial for women to avoid some of the potential counterregulatory hormonal effects that can occur through insulin suppression associated with the ketogenic diet.",

For a normal, healthy person using the ketogenic diet as a lifestyle, it’s about being metabolically flexible. Spiking insulin into the moderate range a few times a week can really be beneficial to assist in recovery, but to also keep that energetic pathway open. A super strict ketogenic diet all the time is going to produce some level of physiological insulin resistance that is not advantageous.",

Additionally, Dom would like to explore in utero experiments where you feed the mom high-fructose corn syrup, oxidized fats, trans fats, glyphosate, chemicals and follow the offspring to see if there’s an increase in disease.
