According to the authors, and the New York Times citing CDC data, increases in unintentional injury deaths were largely driven by drug overdoses. This increase may be due in part to an increase in social isolation and a decline in mental and emotional health during the pandemic. In fact, even before the pandemic, I wrote about the increase in deaths of despair —drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related diseases—-contributing to the three consecutive years of decline in life expectancy in the U.S.",
