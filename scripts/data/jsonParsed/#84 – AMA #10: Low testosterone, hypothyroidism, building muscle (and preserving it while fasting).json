So an endocrine response that would produce the lowest SHBG would be hyperinsulinemia, low estrogen, and low thyroid.",

The risk of dementia goes down lower and lower as IGF levels get higher and higher. The human data on IGF is confusing, for more on this topic check out Peter’s discussion with Nir Barzilai starting at 1:34:15. Instead of aiming for IGF levels that are constantly low or constantly high, the best approach is for IGF levels to be cycled from low to high.",

You must utilize the free leucine that your body does a remarkable job preserving during the fast, and you must give it a reason to be assimilated. If you do that, you can come very close to maintaining nitrogen balance, which means keeping nitrogen in your muscles as opposed to shedding muscle. Conversely, if you fast without resistance training, you are likely to lose some muscle. Exercise and testosterone preserve muscle during fasting.",
