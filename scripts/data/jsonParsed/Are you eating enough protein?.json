  "content": "Most people are not eating enough protein. The recommended daily allowances (RDA), are considered insufficient. The RDA for protein is roughly 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. This is likely predicated on how much protein you need to live versus how much protein you need to thrive. It is suggested that we probably need closer to two grams per kilogram or about a gram per pound of body weight.",

You’re looking at somewhere in the order of three to four grams per kilogram before you get into the places where you’re going to start to challenge your kidney’s abilities to take care of excess nitrogen.",
