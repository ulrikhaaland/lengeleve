  "content": "Most people are not eating enough protein. The recommended daily allowances (RDA), are “pathetic” says Peter. The RDA for protein is roughly 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. You take an 80 kilogram person, so someone that weighs like about 175, and that person should only be eating 65 grams of protein a day or “something asinine like that”. The RDA is likely predicated on how much protein you need to like live versus how much protein you need to thrive. We probably need closer to two grams per kilogram or about a gram per pound of body weight.",
