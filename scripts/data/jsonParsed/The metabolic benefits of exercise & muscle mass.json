  "content": "If you want to be metabolically healthy, the best thing you can do is have lots of lean body mass. Muscle/ lean body mass is a metabolic sink. Obese powerlifters may have some elevations in blood lipids and whatnot, but usually their insulin sensitivity and blood glucose are okay. Exercise is one of the only things that we know of that without even weight loss improves metabolic health substantially, really substantially. A high dose of exercise is not required. Just going and being sedentary to walking 100 minutes a week, and you will see improvements in health markers.",
