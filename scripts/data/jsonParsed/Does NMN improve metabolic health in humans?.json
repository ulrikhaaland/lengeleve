  "date": "May 9, 2021",
  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A study tested the effect of a high dose of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) in overweight or obese postmenopausal pre-diabetic women. It found one statistically significant difference between the placebo and treatment groups: improved muscle insulin sensitivity. NMN, like nicotinamide riboside, is an oral precursor to NAD+. As we age, cellular NAD+ levels decline. Because NAD+ is an important substrate for sirtuins, which play an important role in DNA repair, it is hypothesized that replacing NAD+ will be geroprotective (i.e., slow the aging process).",

  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "It’s not clear if NAD+ declines with age because we’re using more to repair increasingly damaged DNA, or if it declines for some other reason, which limits its availability for repair, but it does seem highly plausible that more cellular NAD+ is a good thing. It’s also hypothesized the NMN might be a more stable way to deliver this precursor than NR.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Commercial doses of NMN are typically sold at 50 to 150 mg, but the treatment group took 250 mg per day for 10 weeks versus a placebo group. At the conclusion of the study, the investigators repeated something called a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp which is considered the gold standard to measure how well muscles take up glucose. The NMN group was better at putting at least some amount of glucose into their muscles post-treatment, when insulin is present.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "While the difference in glucose disposal is statistically significant, it is unclear if it is clinically significant. With such a small number of participants, including a massive response in one individual, which may have skewed the average glucose disposal rate in the NMN group upward, it is uncertain if these results can be applied outside the context of this study. There were also several findings in the study that call into question the efficacy of the intervention.",

A good geroprotective candidate will have several lines of evidence pointing to its efficacy, including human studies showing improvements in outcomes related to quality of life and even mortality, and animal studies finding extension of lifespan. The ITP uses hundreds of mice for each study, they carry out parallel studies at multiple sites, they use genetically heterozygous mice. The results show that NR failed to increase lifespan.",
