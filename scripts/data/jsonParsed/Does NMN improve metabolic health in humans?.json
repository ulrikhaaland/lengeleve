  "content": "A study found that a high dose of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) improved muscle insulin sensitivity in overweight or obese postmenopausal pre-diabetic women. The treatment group took 250 mg per day for 10 weeks versus a placebo group. At the conclusion of the study, the investigators repeated something called a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp which is considered the gold standard to measure how well muscles take up glucose. The NMN group was better at putting at least some amount of glucose into their muscles post-treatment, when insulin is present.",

  "content": "In the study, improvements in insulin sensitivity did not lead to improvements in other related markers of metabolic health, except for one metric, despite a duration of 10 weeks. It would have been helpful to see a 24-hour area under the curve or AUC for insulin, or a 24-hour urinary C-peptide, to see if there was less overall secretion over the course of the day, which would lend more credence to NMN improving overall insulin sensitivity.",

  "title": "Supplementing NR or NMN for Geroprotection",
  "date": "May 9, 2021",
  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "I still remain unconvinced that supplementing NR or NMN is geroprotective in a meaningful way. Is it possible the dose was still too low in this study, or that more time is needed? Yes, and that’s worth more investigation. But consider the recent results from the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), which sought to test this rigorously using NR (though not NMN). A good geroprotective candidate will have several lines of evidence pointing to its efficacy, including human studies showing improvements in outcomes related to quality of life and even mortality (consider metformin in cancer patients) and animal studies finding extension of lifespan (consider rapamycin in virtually every test model). The ITP uses hundreds of mice for each study, they carry out parallel studies at multiple sites, they use genetically heterozygous mice, and they have an open invitation for anyone to suggest a molecule to be studied. In fact, a company that was interested in making an NR supplement recommended it for testing by the ITP several years ago. When I discussed this topic on the podcast with Rich Miller, one of the architects of the ITP, the data was not yet published. It is now, and the results show that NR failed to increase lifespan. When you compare its results to date to NR and NMN, they’re just not in the same ballpark.",
