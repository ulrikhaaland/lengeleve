  "content": "The term “standard drink” when describing alcohol consumption: a can of beer, a glass of wine, and a shot of liquor each have about the same amount of alcohol, 14 g. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines heavy drinking for men as >14 drinks per week or >4 drinks per day. For women, however, heavy drinking is defined by much lower consumption levels: only >7 drinks per week (or >3 drinks per day).",

  "content": "Body weight alone cannot tell the full story. Alcohol dissolves much more readily in water than in fat, making total body water content a more relevant measure than body weight for predicting how a given quantity of alcohol will impact an individual’s BAC. Men, on average, have greater body water content than women, resulting in a lower rise in BAC for a given quantity of alcohol.",

  "date": "June 4, 2022",
  "context": "Alcohol",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "After consumption, alcohol is eventually broken down by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), primarily in the liver. However, this enzyme is also found in the stomach, where it can catalyze first-pass alcohol metabolism, thus limiting the amount of alcohol that can be absorbed from the intestine, enter circulation, and make its way to the liver. The amount of gastric ADH is significantly lower in women than in men. The reduced level of gastric ADH means that less alcohol is metabolized in the stomach, resulting in greater absorption and a larger quantity of alcohol entering circulation.",

  "content": "In the short term, women will be more likely to experience the effects of intoxication when drinking the same volume of alcohol as men and will have a higher BAC, increasing the risk for intoxication-related injuries, fatalities, and legal repercussions (e.g., driving while intoxicated). In the longer term, increased alcohol consumption leads to increased risk for myriad diseases including alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic gastritis, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and alcoholic cardiomyopathy. There have also been observed monotonic relationships with colorectal and other cancers and neurodegenerative pathologies, meaning that the risk of developing these diseases increases proportionally with increasing amounts of alcohol reaching these tissues.",

Women may be at far greater risk of the health consequences of alcohol and need to exercise even more caution around alcohol consumption than men. The recommendations for 50% fewer weekly drinks might not be so far off after all.",
