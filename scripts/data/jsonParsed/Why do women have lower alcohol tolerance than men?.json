  "content": "Men, on average, have greater body water content than women, resulting in a lower rise in BAC for a given quantity of alcohol. Even when matched for height and weight, most women have a lower total body water volume than men because women generally have a higher body fat percentage. This means that for a man and woman of equal height and weight, the same amount of alcohol is concentrated in a smaller volume in a woman, leading to higher blood alcohol levels.",

  "context": "Alcohol",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "After consumption, alcohol is eventually broken down by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), primarily in the liver. However, this enzyme is also found in the stomach, where it can catalyze first-pass alcohol metabolism, thus limiting the amount of alcohol that can be absorbed from the intestine, enter circulation, and make its way to the liver. The amount of gastric ADH is significantly lower in women than in men. The reduced level of gastric ADH means that less alcohol is metabolized in the stomach, resulting in greater absorption and a larger quantity of alcohol entering circulation. This constitutes another reason why, even when alcohol dosage is adjusted for body weight, BAC will be higher in women.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Alcohol metabolism in the stomach is important for both men and women. Gastric ADH is a far more active contributor to alcohol metabolism in men than in women. Women will be more likely to experience the effects of intoxication when drinking the same volume of alcohol as men and will have a higher BAC, increasing the risk for intoxication-related injuries, fatalities, and legal repercussions.",

  "content": "Increased alcohol consumption leads to increased risk for myriad diseases including alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic gastritis, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and alcoholic cardiomyopathy. There have also been observed monotonic relationships with colorectal and other cancers and neurodegenerative pathologies, meaning that the risk of developing these diseases increases proportionally with increasing amounts of alcohol reaching these tissues. Womenâ€™s susceptibility to high BACs may put them at particular risk.",

  "content": "Their average smaller size, higher percent body fat, and reduced first-pass metabolism mean that women may be at far greater risk of the health consequences of alcohol and need to exercise even more caution around alcohol consumption than men. Although women are not half the size of men, when we take all factors into consideration, the recommendations for 50% fewer weekly drinks might not be so far off after all.",
