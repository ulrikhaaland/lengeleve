She became a huge believer in the efficacy of carbohydrate restriction for the treatment of type 2 diabetes through her research and clinical experience. She challenges the common beliefs about the role of dietary fat and carbohydrate on the plasma makeup of fatty acids and triglycerides. She also expresses the importance of understanding early predictors of metabolic illness—highlighting one particular fatty acid as the most important early predictor—before finishing with a discussion about how doctors might be able to personalize patients’ metabolic management in the future.",

It’s a product of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1), which controls what happens with some FAs. SCD1 is actually an independent marker of triglyceridemia and abdominal adiposity (things that go along with insulin resistance). High levels of SCD1 activity are an early warning sign even if blood sugar is normal, which is important not to miss. The higher the POA, the higher the TGs. If TGs are really high, it’s very likely that POA is elevated as well due to increased activity of SCD1.",
