High levels of SCD1 activity are an early warning sign even if blood sugar is normal, which is important not to miss. The higher the POA, the higher the TGs.

Insulin feeds into the liver via SREBP-1, SCD1 increases. Fructose also comes in through GLUT5, glucose through GLUT2. They’re all feeding into this by slightly different mechanisms to increase SCD1. When you consume high carb diet, this pathway is activated, elevating saturated fat and ultimately VLDL. If the liver is taking in palmitic acid, the first step is to go through SCD1, which adds a double bond. Ultimately increases lipogenesis, increasing the amount of lipid within cholesteryl ester and TG and exporting from the liver. Is protective in a sense because the liver is likely trying to export as much fat as it can and TGs are an efficient place to store it. When exceed export capacity of liver, develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is “truly an epidemic at the moment”.",

Virta was founded by Steve Phinney, Jeff Volek, [and Sami Inkinen] in 2014. Sarah is the Medical Director at Virta and Peter is a small investor and at one point he was an advisor. About a month after seeing Sarah looking healthy at an advisory meeting in June 2017, Peter heard that she had been diagnosed with cancer. On June 30th, 2017, Sarah was on a business call when suddenly she couldn’t talk. Ended up in the trauma bay of the hospital where she works. Found a large brain tumor and multiple tumors in her chest, had urgent brain surgery the next day. Sarah was being irrational because she had always been healthy and taken good care of herself and could not believe this was happening to her. Sarah had treated patients with lung cancer and knew that it meant suffering. Her cancer had widely spread and was Stage IV even she had exercised and felt fine the day before. She was concerned about her family watching her suffer and wanted them to remember her as she was. Cancer changes you. So I’m not that person. One of the many things is sometimes, at this point in time, I mourn that person, because I liked her. 12 to 14% of people who get lung cancer are not smokers. Lung cancer is broadly divided histologically into two types. Small cell carcinoma. Non-small cell carcinoma, of which there are 3 subtypes: Large cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma, Squamous cell carcinoma. Many non-smokers who get lung cancer have have the adenocarcinoma type of non-small cell carcinoma. Given the prevalence and lethality, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women than any other cancer by far.

  "content": "Tagrisso had stopped shrinking her primary tumor in March 2018, almost a year before she began chemo. Since it couldn’t be surgically removed, it was irradiated. Unlike the brain radiation, she did not tolerate the lung radiation well. She had bad chest pain a day or two before leaving on a trip to hike the Inca trail. She decided not to tell anyone because “what a better place to die, than surrounded by your family on the Inca trail in all the beauty of the Andes mountains”. Her family returned home and she went on to Switzerland for a conference, where the pain started to get really bad and felt crushing. She was having a rare complication that impacted her bones but declined treatment because the only option was long-term opioid therapy. But after radiation she had no evidence of disease (NED) for a long time. Life-threatening complications from Gemzar. Conventional wisdom says that Gemzar is easy compared to Cisplatin but Sarah had the opposite experience. Had multiorgan failure (respiratory, liver, kidney) caused by the Gemzar. She got great care and a year later she has no persistent failures even though she was near death. Sarah was in the ICU for a long time. She was on plasmapheresis and had atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), an immune system disorder with which over 70% of patients either quickly die or are on dialysis. she had kidney biopsies, was put on a new medication, did outpatient plasmapheresis, and significantly improved. she got infusions every 8 weeks, so no one would put her back on chemo.",

  "content": "Cancer came back a year later, in September 2020. Got into a clinical trial on December 30, four months after cancer recurred. At the time this seemed like forever, but later she realized many without her advantages would die during that time. Even though she has insurance, she has paid tens of thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs. Between the time the recurrence was diagnosed and the time she finally got treated, Sarah had compression of the bronchus and could not walk up a flight of stairs. Many people with fewer resources would have died. Sarah had to “get almost obnoxious” to get a biopsy in her upper right lobe where the cancer recurred. Needed enough tissue to get a genomics report and make her eligible for a clinical trial.",

  "content": "Peter says time is the most important currency and wonders how Sarah balances her time among her family, her work with diabetics, and now cancer advocacy. Sarah says it was actually hard to be around her kids when she was deep in grief because they reminded her of everything she was going to lose. She has overcome that but her kids still come first. Sarah will continue to advocate for diabetes because it’s important like cancer and she has a platform. Also cares a lot about equity, which impacts both diabetes and cancer. She is doing ok, but never good or great. Doesn’t sit around feeling sorry for herself but “great is hard to think about now”. Does not think that, as many say, cancer gave her a new perspective on life; she loved the way her life was and “it’s still a little hard to get used to who this person is now”.",
