  "content": "There are not many topics in clinical medicine more polarizing than hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for women suffering from menopausal symptoms. Recently, The Lancet published a study finding “definite” excess risks of breast cancer associated with the use of HRT (with the exception of vaginal estrogen). The investigators reported having analyzed the data records of 108,647 postmenopausal breast cancer patients collected from dozens of previously published reports as well as unpublished data sets, and compared each patient with up to four randomly selected matched controls without a breast cancer diagnosis. Even if their unclear assumptions are true and their difficult-to-understand calculations accurate, the Collaborative Group’s authors conclude that MHT administration would result in only one additional breast cancer for every 50 women who took it for 5 years, while taking estrogen alone would result in one additional breast cancer for every 200 women treated. Moreover, the authors fail to say that even if their finding of a small increased risk is valid,  breast cancer is currently curable in approximately 90% of newly diagnosed patients. Additionally, they fail to provide a balanced discussion of MHT’s benefits, which include relief from incapacitating menopausal symptoms, and reductions in the risks of cardiovascular disease (responsible for killing seven times more women than breast cancer), osteoporotic hip fracture, and Alzheimer’s Disease.",

  "title": "Criticism of the Million Women Study",
  "date": "September 22, 2019",
  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The Million Women Study consisted only of 2 questionnaires separated by about 3 years and sent to over a million women. Only 44% of the sample responded to both surveys. The total incidence of breast cancer in this study, among all the women surveyed, was 1.4%. The investigators estimated that for every 1,000 women taking combination estrogen/progestin for 5 years, there would be an extra 6 cases of diagnosed breast cancer, and for every 1,000 women taking estrogen alone for five years, there would be an extra 1.5 cases. Of that 1.4%, the increased risk of breast cancer was identified only in current hormone users but not in past users— even if past use had exceeded 15 years. The authors never explain or offer a biologic rationale for why current use is harmful and past use is not. The average time from beginning therapy to diagnosis of breast cancer was brief (1.2 years), suggesting to clinicians that, in many cases, breast cancer had been present, but unidentified, before the women entered the study.",
