  "content": "The investigators reported having analyzed the data records of 108,647 postmenopausal breast cancer patients collected from dozens of previously published reports as well as unpublished data sets, and compared each patient with up to four randomly selected matched controls without a breast cancer diagnosis. The complexity of the study design makes it difficult to appraise the results and most of us will take the results on face value. Even if their unclear assumptions are true and their difficult-to-understand calculations accurate, the Collaborative Group’s authors conclude that MHT administration would result in only one additional breast cancer for every 50 women who took it for 5 years, while taking estrogen alone would result in one additional breast cancer for every 200 women treated.",

Of that 1.4%, the increased risk of breast cancer was identified only in current hormone users but not in past users— even if past use had exceeded 15 years.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The average time from beginning therapy to diagnosis of breast cancer was brief (1.2 years), suggesting to clinicians that, in many cases, breast cancer had been present, but unidentified, before the women entered the study; the women who filled out the original questionnaire may have been aware of a problem in the breast, prompting their participation. The study appears to have been selecting this population with, not surprisingly, a high incidence of breast cancer. Perhaps, also not surprisingly, the median time from diagnosis to death from breast cancer in that study was only 1.7 years.",

For those starting it more than five years after a final period, the incidence of breast cancer was the same as that found among never users.(9) How is this biologically plausible?",

  "content": "The Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer conducted an individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence and found that the type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy is associated with breast cancer risk. Kotsopoulos also found definitive evidence for the link between menopausal hormones and breast cancer. The Million Women Study investigated the link between hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer, and found that it may increase the risk of developing breast cancer. The study was criticized by van der Mooren and Kenemans, and Shapiro et al. applied causal principles to the study. The Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer also conducted a reanalysis of data from 51 epidemiological studies and found a link between breast cancer and hormone replacement therapy. Colditz et al. found that the use of estrogens and progestins may increase the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Rossouw et al. found that estrogen plus progestin may have risks and benefits in healthy postmenopausal women. Beral et al. found that the interval between menopause and starting hormone therapy may affect breast cancer risk.",
