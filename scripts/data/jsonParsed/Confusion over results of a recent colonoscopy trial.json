Colonoscopy is the gold standard screening modality for colorectal cancer (CRC) – the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths after lung cancer – and the CDC and American Cancer Society recommend colonoscopy screenings every 10 years for those between the ages of 45 to 75.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The Nordic-European Initiative on Colorectal Cancer (NordICC) trial aimed to investigate the effect of colonoscopy screening on the risk of CRC diagnosis and death. The investigators report that invitation to undergo colonoscopy screening was associated with an unexpectedly modest (18%) reduction in risk for CRC diagnosis relative to the usual-care group. Further, no significant difference was observed between the invited group and usual-care group in deaths attributable to colorectal cancer or in deaths attributable to all causes.",

Effectiveness – how well an intervention performs in real-world conditions in which patients are free to make their own decisions – is also critical for understanding the overall impact an intervention will have on the population level.",

The NordICC trial was designed to test effectiveness, and while per-protocol analyses can hint at efficacy, it’s important to recognize that such estimates are very crude due to inherent flaws in such secondary analyses.",

If you are an individual concerned above all with maintaining your own health and that of your loved ones – or if you are a healthcare provider responsible for advising individuals on their own health – these data provide encouraging (albeit crude) evidence that colonoscopy screenings do significantly reduce risk of CRC diagnosis and death, and they are very safe in experienced hands.",
