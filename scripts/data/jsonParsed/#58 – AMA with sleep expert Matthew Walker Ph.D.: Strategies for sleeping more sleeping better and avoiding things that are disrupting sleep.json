It’s best to wake up at the exact same time every single day, weekend, weekday, etc. Even if you’ve had a bad night of sleep…wake up at the same time. By doing that, it is a self regulating factor for better sleep. It’s going to be a lot more difficult for you to fall into bad patterns of things like sleep onset insomnia or sleep maintenance insomnia. Waking up at the same time every single day is king.",

  "content": "If you take a bucket of people with same age and compare those that are short sleeping vs. those that are sleeping a health amount…the people who are getting less sleep have a biological age greater than their chronological age. Telomeres have often been used as sort of somewhat of a biomarker of age and advanced or accelerated or artificially accelerated aging. That’s exactly what you see in people who are under slept. Sleep deprivation can increase the aging of skin. Underslept people have less resilient skin. A fantastic database called the MESA Database which is a fantastic study of atherosclerosis shows that getting six hours of sleep or less relative to people who are getting eight hours of sleep or more makes your heart look 10 years older. In short, you can increase your biological age deleteriously with short sleeping despite having the same chronological age.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "No, people can be less affected in some ways. But that generally means they might be more affected in another way. Memory, spatial attention, emotional stability, judgment, and decision making are all impaired by sleep deprivation on the average. However, if you look at each individual, not all people show impairment in all those areas when they are sleep deprived. Different people are differentially vulnerable to sleep deprivation in different domains of brain function. In other words, just because you’re resilient to not slowing down in your response times, doesn’t mean that you’re going to be also resilient in other parts of the brain. If anything in fact, you will fall apart. So… the point is I suspect the same is true…in the body for all of those different physiological systems, too.",

We constrain total sleep time. Use brute force efficiency in a brute force response from the brain and all of a sudden something magical happens. You start to control your sleep rather than your sleep controlling you. This is usually one of the last tools in the CBTI box that you typically use just because it’s so hard for compliance and adherence and it is pretty miserable because we’re putting you on essentially a short sleep restriction… but it’s a wonderful way for the patient to then finally feel as though they have control because it’s a technique that they can use once they understand how the sleep system works.",

A recent intervention study looking at young kids. 800 kids in an area around a town called Sheffield in the UK. The kids were considerably getting less sleep than they needed. They found that the implementation of four things actually added almost two hours of sleep to their kids: Regularity: Bed at the same time and waking up at the same time. Removing all toys and electronics from the bedroom: turns bedroom into an environment that was queued up for sleep. Relaxing routine: building in some kind of relaxing routine (e.g., reading with the child before bed). Daylight exposure: making sure that the child got sufficient daylight throughout the day.",
