It’s a remarkable health insurance policy, it’s largely democratic, free and largely painless”‒ Matt Walker. Sleep is the foundation of health. In terms of de-risking just about every disease that is killing us in the developed world, it’s very hard to look no further than sleep. Nutrition and exercise are important, but sleep is the foundation. “Sleep is the foundation on which those two other things sit. It’s not the third pillar of good health, I think it is the foundation”.",

Every now and then, you’ll get these synchronous bursts of electrical activity called sleep spindles ⇒ big slow wave, then a burst of spindle. Stages 3 and 4 are the deepest stages of sleep.

Peter Attia says, “I feel very comfortable telling patients that I would rather you stick your genitals in a grinder than you take Ambien or Lunesta”. Sleeping pills seems to weaken the immune system leading to higher rates of infection. Weakened immune can increase cancer risk as well. In 2016, the American College of Physicians said sleeping pills must no longer be the first line recommendation for insomnia. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Peter has had several patients go through CBT-I with “great success”. It’s a nonpharmacological, psychological method working with a therapist. They try to understand where your sleep problems are at and create a bespoke solution for you, the individual. It’s just as efficacious as sleeping pills in the short term. But the real benefit is in long term benefits. When you stop sleeping pills, the benefit goes away, and you might have even made it worse (“rebound insomnia”). With CBT-I, the benefits can last for years after stopping therapy. How do you recommend people find good CBT-I therapists? Peter recommends a sleep doctor Vik Jain in Chicago [now in Frisco, TX]. Here’s a site to help you find a facility near you that is AASM accredited. What questions to ask a potential sleep doctor? Ask them about their success rates. Ask them where they have found problems with your patients. Which patients have you typically had the hardest difficulty with in terms of the profile of sleep problems? And if they sound like you, then maybe you want to look elsewhere as well. Tylenol PM and Benadryl. For Benadryl… Benadryl-induced sleep also has some of the risks associated with it that sleeping pills have. It’s less potent in terms of that bad consequence and outcome to sleep. For Tylenol PM… Not good enough data yet to suggest that it’s either good or bad. What about low doses, or intermittent use of benzodiazepines? Examples: Xanax, Valium. Matthew says be careful, only use it in the most dire of circumstances. It may have similar negative consequences as Ambien and Lunesta per one study by Dan Kripke. Even just 3-18 pills per year can have a significant mortality risk. “See how far you can really get with all of the other kaleidoscope of possibilities of sleep enhancing possibilities that we’ve discussed.  And if those fail, then I think you can think about last resources.  But those drugs typically just are not producing natural sleep.  So I would think of those medications like that box on the wall that says, ‘Break glass in terms of emergency.’  If you’re in that situation and you’re really struggling, then it’s possible that that’s the time to break the glass, but those shattered shards can sometimes still cut you.”‒ Matt Walker",
