Sleep is the foundation of health. In terms of de-risking just about every disease that is killing us in the developed world, it’s very hard to look no further than sleep. Nutrition and exercise are important, but sleep is the foundation. Deprivation of sleep causes the quickest reduction of health. Guinness has banned trying to set record for sleep deprivation because it’s so dangerous (cancer, mental health, CVD, metabolic syndrome, suicidality).",

  "content": "Humans (mammals) have 2 stages of sleep: Non-REM and REM sleep. Non-REM has 4 stages‒ cleverly titled stages 1, 2, 3, and 4. Stages 3 and 4 are the very deep restorative stages. Stages 1 and 2 are the lightest stages of sleep. Non-REM + REM sleep combine to form 90 minute sleep cycles. Every 90 minutes, your brain cycles between non-REM and REM sleep. Then this is replayed every 90 minutes to create what we call a standard cycling architecture of sleep, or what we call a hypnogram of sleep.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Your sleep chronotype simply means are you a morning person, an evening person, or somewhere in between. Sleep science breaks it into 4 categories: Extreme morning types, Morning types, Middle evening types, Extreme evening types. There is a strong genetic component underlying sleep chronotypes. Evidence that it’s genetic‒ There is a significant degree of heritability. There are a collection of genes that will determine, to a degree, your chronotype. Data from 23andMe says there’s about 9 different genes that will contribute to your chronotype. Most are what we call “clock genes”‒ this refers to the fact that these genes control the rhythm of your circadian cycle.",

The frequency of daytime naps decreases. The optimal room temperature for sleep is between 65-67 degrees. Warming up extremities (hands and feet) can help you fall asleep faster. Then you need to get cold to stay asleep during the night. And then you need to warm up to wake up in the morning. Other tips for cooling your core body temperature include taking a hot bath or a shower. To fall asleep faster, warm yourself up with a hot shower to radiate that heat out and get you to sleep quicker. Keep the room cool to keep your body cold throughout that middle section and later section of sleep. Then, set your thermostat to rise in the last 15 minutes of your sleep so you will wake up easier and feel less groggy.",

It’s less about the blue light, and more about the devices ability to increase alertness/physiological arousal in the brain.",

Some people have very little sensitivity to caffeine, for example, and for those people caffeine in the morning is fine.",

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is a nonpharmacological, psychological method working with a therapist that is just as efficacious as sleeping pills in the short term. The benefits can last for years after stopping therapy. Benadryl-induced sleep also has some of the risks associated with it that sleeping pills have. It’s less potent in terms of that bad consequence and outcome to sleep. There's not enough data yet to suggest that Tylenol PM is either good or bad.",

They are critical for things like learning, memory, and brain plasticity. Sleep spindles occur at the end of a deep, slow wave. Once you’ve hit the peak of that slow wave, you will often have a little bit of a spindle burst (that burst in tandem is called phase amplitude coupling). This coupling is critical for long term memory transfer and for strengthening connections between brain cells (brain plasticity or long-term potentiation).",
