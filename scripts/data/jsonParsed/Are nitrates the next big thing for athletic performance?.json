  "content": "Beets (also known as beetroots) are a source of dietary nitrates, one of five supplements listed in the International Olympic Committeeâ€™s consensus statement on dietary supplements as having strong evidence to support their use for boosting exercise performance. Existing evidence suggests that nitrates from vegetable sources such as beets and leafy greens can be processed to nitrite and nitric oxide via the enterosalivary pathway and provide benefits for cardiovascular health and exercise performance.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In a review, data from 19 studies was re-analyzed to hone in on the ability of dietary nitrate supplementation to increase neuromuscular power. These studies primarily utilized concentrated beetroot juice as the source of dietary nitrate. The studies measured neuromuscular power among subjects tested in a non-fatigued state using various exercises. As a result of their meta-analysis, an effect size of 0.43 was reported, corresponding to an impressive 5% increase in muscle power with vs. without nitrate supplementation.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The majority of studies included in the analysis had not measured the dose of nitrate administered, and most failed to monitor any markers of nitrate bioavailability. Another limitation is that the mechanism by which dietary nitrates may increase muscle power remains undefined. Nitrates and nitrites are also commonly used as an additive in processed meats such as bacon and hot dogs and have long been thought to contribute to increased risk for certain cancers.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The results of the current systematic review and meta-analysis support previous findings on the benefits of nitrate supplementation on performance, with a reported average increase in muscle power of 5%. For competitive athletes, this could provide the boost needed to dramatically move up in their ranking. For adults struggling with declines in strength that accompany aging, this could aid in everyday tasks and wellbeing.",

  "content": "Maximal benefits are achieved with acute supplementation and non-endurance, non-maximal activity. The lack of precise dosage data in most of the source studies prohibits fair sub-analyses. More research is necessary in order to characterize this effect more fully and determine optimal dosing and frequency. Follow-up studies should also seek to clarify the mechanisms through which dietary nitrate achieves its observed and hypothesized benefits and risks.",
