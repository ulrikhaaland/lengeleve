  "content": "A 2021 study titled “PR Lotion significantly improves high-intensity interval performance” found more than a 20% improvement in high-intensity interval training to exhaustion in a study of competitive cyclists. The study was a double-blinded, randomized, controlled crossover trial. Participants completed an average of just under 14 intervals when using the control lotion compared to 17 intervals with PR Lotion, which works out to about a 20% improvement using PR Lotion vs the control lotion.",

  "context": "Exercise & Physical Health",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "PR Lotion is essentially a topical delivery of sodium bicarbonate, more commonly referred to as baking soda. The higher the intensity of exercise, the more acidic your muscles and blood become, as hydrogen concentration increases in lockstep with lactate concentration. Baking soda has alkaline or base properties, which can neutralize excess H+, giving baking soda the potential to counteract the acidification of blood. If this happens during higher intensity exercise, it might allow someone to work a little harder and/or a little longer before they reach exhaustion.",

  "title": "Side Effects of Baking Soda and PR Lotion",
  "date": "March 26, 2022",
  "context": "Exercise & Physical Health",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Many people using baking soda experience gastrointestinal side effects which can limit its efficacy. But delivering the baking soda through the skin bypasses the GI tract and limits these adverse effects. In fact, the 2021 PR Lotion study described above notes that no side effects were reported by participants.",

  "content": "A previous double-blinded, randomized, controlled crossover trial in 20 competitive cyclists indicated PR Lotion was superior to control with statistically significant improvement in reducing delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) following intense exercise, lowering heart rate and perceived exertion (RPE) under the same training loads, and tolerating higher blood lactate levels. However, the investigators did not find significant pH differences.",

  "context": "Exercise & Physical Health",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "One of the limitations to these studies is that they are a good example of the sharpshooter fallacy. The term refers to the story of a Texan who shoots holes in the side of the barn and then draws targets around the bullet holes. Another way to put it: it’s important to call your shots before you take them. Trials often presented as hypothesis-testing are actually hypothesis-generating because of this bias.",

  "date": "March 26, 2022",
  "context": "Exercise & Physical Health",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The impressive performance and recovery benefits of PR Lotion related to hard bouts of exercise. The 2021 study is the more compelling of the two studies, both because of its simpler design in terms of a more specific prediction and test and because of its results. In terms of performance, the 2021 and 2018 studies were testing different activities. The 2021 study assessed high-intensity intervals lasting 30 seconds while the 2018 study assessed sustained efforts of five and 60 minutes. The 2021 study was also very small, and the list of interventions that work in very small studies, only to fail in larger studies is awfully long. One interpretation is that the PR Lotion may be better suited for short periods of intense work coupled with short periods of rest in between.",
