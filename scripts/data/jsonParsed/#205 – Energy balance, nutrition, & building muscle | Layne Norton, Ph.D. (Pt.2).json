  "content": "The challenge of tracking energy expenditure accurately, and the thermic effect of different macronutrients. Sources of error when tracking calories. The confusion arises when someone tracks their calories, sees a 500 calorie deficit but doesn’t lose weight. There are several sources of error. People often weigh themselves sporadically. It’s virtually meaningless to weigh yourself only once a week. Layne is very regimented about this: weigh yourself first thing in the morning after voiding your bladder and bowel (if possible) before eating. Take that weight every single day and average it for the week. Compare week to week averages. Weight can easily fluctuate 2% per day; so if you’re 200 lbs you could be 204 or 196. You don’t want just 1 isolated data point. A shift in fluids can make a difference but weekly and monthly changes in weight are dictated more by your actual body mass. Wrist devices that measure energy expenditures are not particularly accurate. The other thing that confuses people is tracking their energy expenditure. A study of wrist devices found they overestimate exercise energy expenditure from 28-93%. 20 different devices were compared. This is a problem when you’re exercising and the device says you burned 500 calories when in reality you probably burned around 260-400 calories. It is also difficult to accurately track calories because there is up to a 20% error allowed in food labels. People also have trouble estimating their energy intake.",

So therefore keeping a budget is worthless.” You don’t have to keep a budget to same money, but it’s a useful tool.

When you snack, you tend to do it and not being mindful about it so it doesn’t have the same satiety effect. Layne tells clients to stop snacking.

There’s actually very small favoritism towards low fat. But that’s probably a data artifact and not a real difference. David Ludwig published a recent meta-analysis that made the assertion that there doesn’t appear to be much difference in the short-term data in low carb diets. But longer-term (after 17 days), there appears to be a large difference in energy expenditure on the order of 150-300 calories per day. Published in the Journal of Nutrition in 2021, Do Lower-Carbohydrate Diets Increase Total Energy Expenditure? An Updated and Reanalyzed Meta-Analysis of 29 Controlled-Feeding Studies. This meta-analysis was very well done; the statistics are very good. But when there was metabolic chamber data available or doubly labeled water, they used doubly labeled water. To Layne this is like saying “I’ve got caliper data available, and DEXA data available, but I’m going to use the caliper data”. Keep in mind that DEXA is what calipers are validated against, so you’re talking about a primary measure versus a secondary measure.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter remembers that he got Kevin Hall and John Speakman’s primary criticism of DLW (doubly labeled water) in a KD (ketogenic diet). The gist of their thesis on where the artifact comes from is there’s more CO2 produced than is accounted for in the constant of the equation. The 1.11 is probably too low a number [Weir formula = (3.94)(VO2) + (1.11)(VCO2)]. Layne reasons that overproduce CO2 compared to what the prediction would be based on that equation. Basically what that means is that in a low carb setting, you’re probably getting an artificial increase in energy expenditure. So Peter realizes that 1.11 would actually be too large a coefficient. Layne considers if this isn’t an artifact of differences in measures, and with direct calorimetry on a standard diet, the association with doubly labeled water is an R of 0.8. This is good for free living. Peter agrees that 0.8 is good but not exceptional. But then low carb is 0.8 which is a big difference from 0.8. It basically just means it’s not as tightly correlated.",

Depending on how much of that label shows up in the vein versus the artery, we know how much is being retained in muscle and we know what the net is. You can infuse a second label to presumably get synthesis as well and then you can figure out the difference of degradation. But the problem with this is it requires a steady state. You can’t do it when you’ve trained or had a meal or anything like that so it has to be done while fasting. The problem with degradation is how you’re measuring it.

But muscle tissue is about 70% water so to get to the actual protein content divide 8 lbs by 0.3; so it’s 26 lbs. That’s a lot of lean body mass even for a novice trainer. We know the max is about 5-10 g in a drug-free person. He’s not sure how much this would increase with anabolic steroid use. It’s hard to get IRB approval to do research with steroids.

Layne thinks it’s around 1.6 to 2.4 grams per kilogram of body weight. This kind of winds up with that old 1 gram per pound of body weight number.

Layne focuses on the portions of meat she is eating and what he can get her to eat. He would want her to eat 110-120 grams of protein a day, just under a gram per lb of her body weight. Breakfast is where most Americans eat a very low protein meal. Peter adds that she has been doing time-restricted eating, eating only 2 meals a day (lunch and dinner).

Layne notes that you can still get the majority of benefits of time-restricted eating by having a lean protein or shake for breakfast.

Elevations in insulin result in insulin signaling through AKT (shown in pink in the figure below), which can then transmit to mTOR (shown in purple at the bottom of the figure). This is pushing that button on a chronic, low level (as opposed to a pulsatile stimulus). There’s a big difference between a dose of protein that causes mTOR to rise and go back down in a natural rhythm [and a chronic stimulus]. This is also tissue-specific; we’re talking about in skeletal muscle, not liver, not brain necessarily, those sorts of things. The same is true for IGF-1. Layne asks, “Where are all the resistance-trained people that are getting cancer by the droves?” The amplitude of response from mTOR due to resistance training dwarfs what protein does. If we look at the meta-analyses on cancer incidence amongst resistance trainers, we see lower levels of cancer in people who resistance train. This tells Layne there’s a difference between these 2 signals. Peter points out that people would say the difference is a healthy user bias.

People will have difficulty tolerating a straight whey concentrate but a blend of concentrate and isolate is what is mostly out there (and is tolerated well). Whey comes from cow’s milk. Centrifuge off the fat, take what is left over and precipitate out the casein (the non-soluble fraction of milk), and the soluble portion that is left over is whey. Whey mostly consists of proteins called lactalbumins. It’s a high-quality, easily digestible, very bioavailable source of protein. It’s top in terms of muscle protein synthesis; it always scores highest in his research. There was no statistical difference from egg protein. Maybe if you had a higher subject number you could pick out some statistical difference between whey and egg. But people like whey a little bit better. Peter asks what brand he thinks is best. Shameless plug— Layne has his own supplement line, Outwork Nutrition. He has a whey protein isolate (outward nutrition build); isolates are a little bit more expensive than a concentrate isolate blend, but it is better for sensitivities. There are people with lactose intolerance. There are people with sensitivity to the lactalbumins. An isolate is generally well tolerated. Some people with really high sensitivity to the lactalbumins can’t tolerate an isolate. If that’s the case, they could probably do a hydrolyzate, which is a little more expensive and doesn’t taste as good, but still a good option for those that with a really sensitive GI. So it’s just low carbohydrate, low lactose, low fat, high protein, high leucine. So I think our leucine contents over 11 per, I think it’s actually 12%, which is very high. And then the carbohydrate content, depending on vanilla or chocolate is like one to four grams. And then the fat content is less than a gram of fat. In fact, the vanilla is zero. Other brands Layne trusts include: Legion, Optimum, EAS. Recommendations for reading labels. He recommends avoiding proprietary blends. “Proprietary blends are usually just a way for people to hide stuff”— Layne Norton. You also want to avoid products that are doing what’s called nitrogen spiking. You can pump up the protein and nitrogen content by adding individual amino acids that cost less than just the whey protein itself. Such as glycine. Sometimes creatine is added; not that creatine isn’t good but you’re taking away protein. This is another way to cut costs and increase the protein content.",
