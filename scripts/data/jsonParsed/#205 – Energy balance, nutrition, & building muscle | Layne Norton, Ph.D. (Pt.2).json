  "content": "Energy balance is about tracking calories in and calories out, which is the energy consumed and energy spent. A calorie is a unit of measurement for energy stored in the chemical bonds of food. When food is broken down, these molecules go through metabolism and energy is liberated. Energy is stored in fat in adipose tissue, which is a store of excess energy. Some energy can also be stored in glycogen. The contribution of glycogen to your relative energy stores is actually really small, about 1500 to 2000 calories of energy. So your adipose tissue is by far the biggest energy store.",

Factors influencing energy expenditure include lean mass, which requires quite a bit of oxygen compared to adipose tissue. Also when you start doing activity, it requires a lot of oxygen. All the energy you expend in 1 day is called the TDEE (total daily energy expenditure). The biggest portion of this for most people is the BMR.",
