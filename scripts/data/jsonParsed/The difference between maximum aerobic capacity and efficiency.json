  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Oskar Svensson was a former downhill skier who had taken a talent screening to see whether he’d be suitable for something like cycling. At age 17, completely untrained, he scored something like 74 milliliters per kilogram per minute in VO2 max. He started training as a cyclist as a teenager and pretty quickly scored 83, then 85, then 92. Then, a scientific journal was eventually published saying his score was 96.7 when he was 18 years old. Oskar’s score of 96.7 is “higher than the rumors, but it’s way higher than the verified numbers”. They even disassembled the machine and send it back to the manufacturer to get it calibrated. After his retirement they published the data and shared it. He was tested again several months later, he has put on 2.5 kilos of body weight. His VO2 max number came down into the 80s. But his absolute level of maximal oxygen consumption had barely come down. Alex finds this second test to be the most convincing argument that the original test was accurate. He turned pro at age 20 with team called Joker. The expectations were out of line with what was reasonable. Officially announced his retirement when he was 23.",

  "content": "An athlete over time should get better and better. For a fixed wattage, you want to see what’s called PvO2 (power at a given VO2) come down as you get better. In running, this would be the vVO2. In other words, for a given oxygen consumption, you want velocity to go up just as you would want power to go up. Peter is very surprised by that — “I would have been less surprised if it had been unchanged, but I was very surprised that it deteriorated.” Long-standing debate: Is there an inverse relationship between VO2 max and efficiency? Said another way, if you build your engine bigger, do you necessarily end up with a less efficient engine? Still no consensus on this.",

  "content": "If you just take a bunch of elite athletes and you measure their VO2 max, you tend to see an inverse relationship — The people who have the highest VO2 max tend to have slightly lower, slightly worse economies. People that have the best economy, tend to have slightly worse VO2 max. Possible explanations for this phenomenon:",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "If you happen to have a VO2 max that’s 92, then you’re not going to have the best possible economy. And when you’re only looking at elite athletes, that means that everyone else there’s going to have something special. So if they don’t have the best VO2 max, by definition they have to have a great economy, because they have to have something that’s exceptional. You see this inverse relationship that either you have good economy or you have good VO2 max.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The Oskar Svensson data points to this  explanation. The training he did must have been pretty good for increasing VO2 max. But it may have actually been bad for his economy at a metabolic level. A paper was published in response to this Svensson case study reanalyzing his data. That paper was pointing to a potential cell level explanation of what’s happening to certain enzymes at a given point. The upshot of the paper: If you’re doing a lot of training that requires very high VO2 max level outputs, your metabolism and your cells need to make choices to produce high output, instead of to be as efficient as possible. And over time that’s what you’ll get better at and you’ll lose that efficiency. And so you’ll pay a slight penalty for optimizing your training for VO2 max.",

  "title": "Training for Zone 2",

  "context": "VO2 Max",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The question worth considering is what would have happened if you took Svensson’s genetic gift of an engine and instead of maximizing on VO2 max, you train him and he’d get up to 85 or 90 maybe, but you put much more effort into sort of zone 2 (right at lactate of 2.0). Oskar was spending a lot of time in the 300 to 400 watt range, but he could have probably been in the 300 watt range where he’s still just under two millimole of lactate, but he’s dramatically increasing mitochondrial efficiency. If that zone 2 work represented two thirds of his training volume, he’d likely have a lower VO2 max, but he might have been a better cyclist. “Whatever he did, he paid too high a price for that VO2 max, just by definition, it didn’t work out.” This observation agrees with the prevailing wisdom among endurance athletes that about 80% of your training should be easy, conversational pace (i.e., zone 2).",
