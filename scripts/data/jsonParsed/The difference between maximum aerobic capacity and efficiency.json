  "content": "A higher VO2 Max isn’t always better, and there is a difference between maximum aerobic capacity and efficiency. A case study of a former downhill skier who transitioned to cycling showed that despite having the highest recorded VO2 Max in human history, his performance did not correlate perfectly with this high score. His VO2 Max was 96.7 when he was 18 years old, but his performance did not match this high score. The more he trained, the less efficient he got, meaning he could deliver more aerobic energy, but he used more aerobic energy in order to maintain a given pace.",

  "context": "VO2 Max",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There is a long-standing debate about whether there is an inverse relationship between VO2 Max and efficiency. If you build your engine bigger, do you necessarily end up with a less efficient engine? If you just take a bunch of elite athletes and you measure their VO2 Max, you tend to see an inverse relationship — The people who have the highest VO2 Max tend to have slightly lower, slightly worse economies. People that have the best economy, tend to have slightly worse VO2 Max.",

  "context": "VO2 Max",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There are two possible explanations for this phenomenon. The first is that you don’t tend to hit the lottery twice. If you happen to have a VO2 Max that’s 92, then you’re not going to have the best possible economy. The second possibility is that there’s actually a trade off—if you’re optimizing one physiological parameter it may come at the cost of the other physiological parameter. The training you do must have been pretty good for increasing VO2 Max, but it may have actually been bad for your economy at a metabolic level.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The question worth considering is what would have happened if you took an athlete's genetic gift of an engine and instead of maximizing on VO2 Max, you train him and he’d get up to 85 or 90 maybe, but you put much more effort into sort of zone 2 (right at lactate of 2.0). If that zone 2 work represented two thirds of his training volume, he’d likely have a lower VO2 Max, but he might have been a better cyclist. This observation agrees with the prevailing wisdom among endurance athletes that about 80% of your training should be easy, conversational pace (i.e., zone 2).",
