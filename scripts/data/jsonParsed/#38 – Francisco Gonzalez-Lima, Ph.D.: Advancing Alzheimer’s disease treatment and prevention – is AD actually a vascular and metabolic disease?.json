Lowering your total cholesterol is not going to really make a major difference in this progression. Which is I think one of the biggest misconceptions that is happening in medicine right now.

On the other hand… You can have the similar type of insult to the brain not coming from this arteriosclerotic process. If the heart muscle itself is compromised in its function, because of a process where it weakens its ability to operate as a pump, you’re going to have hypoperfusion developing. So you can have heart disease that has affected the pumping, you know, the force of the pump, that can lead to the hypoperfusion.

The heart is the only organ that is actually perfused during diastole. So in that sense the coronary arteries themselves are less susceptible to hypertension compared to the brain, or the kidney for that matter, which would be the two organs which seem to be most damaged by hypertension. Secondly, in the process of atherosclerosis in the heart, cholesterol does play a very important role, but you still need the initiation of the endothelial injury, which is necessary, but once the lipoprotein can get inside the subendothelial space and becomes oxidized, that’s what elicits the immune response, which is what does the damage.

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The epidemiology shows that there’s no greater association with Alzheimer’s disease (or cardiovascular) than age . . . but after age, reduced activity of cytochrome c oxidase in the brains of AD patients is next most heavily associated with cognitive decline. Cytochrome c oxidase. Why is cytochrome c oxidase important? It is the enzyme that is responsible for oxygen consumption at the cellular level. Also known as Complex IV in the electron transport chain. Therefore without cytochrome c oxidase, the mitochondria have a difficult time creating ATP (energy). The electron transport chain is the key to life. The mitochondria has an inner and outer membrane. There are four complexes. Three of them span both the inner and outer membrane, that’s 1, 3, and 4. Complex 2 is only on the inner membrane. Interrupting their activity of these complexes for even moments at a time is the end of life. Mitochondria. How do we create energy? when we eat food we’re eating stored potential energy that is in a chemical form. The mitochondria takes these units, breaks them apart into electron donors that can be moved the ETC. The electron donors are NADH and FADH. NADH donates to many parts of the ETC (whereas FADH only donates to complex 2). All of this is in service of creating an electron gradient to then fuel the generation of adenosine triphosphate, ATP. “This is a biochemical key to this phenomenon because what we eat from an energy point of view is just becoming electron donors.” The question then becomes… Can we donate electrons to the electron transport? If we could do that, we can accelerate respiration. Peter summarizes what mitochondria do: “The whole purpose of eating is to convert chemical energy into chemical energy from one form to another, but to do it you need an intermediary to translate, that that intermediate has to turn the chemical energy into electrical energy that then facilitates a conversion back to chemical energy. That is the key to life and that is what the mitochondria do.” Every organism on the planet that uses oxygen to obtain energy relies on Cytochrome c oxidase (also known as complex IV in the ETC). If you’re not getting enough oxygen, the process cannot move on to produce electron donations. This might explain why dementia patients are driven to eat simple carbohydrates. So do you think that this is the first insult then? How does that change ultimately impact the ability of the mitochondria to do its job and facilitate electron transfer?",

For example, you have an area of ischemia or you occlude the blood vessel, half an hour later you’ve lost a significant amount of cytochrome oxidase from.

Animal shows a picture that is analogous to what you see in neurocognitive disorders. Decreasing cytochrome c oxidase up to 30% without seeing any neurological evident change.

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Methylene blue is able to act as an electron donor and if you make a very low concentration it will also get electrons from other compounds and it will continue to feed into the electron transport as an alternate route. For example, if you were to totally block complex I, it would be fatal in most cases… but methylene blue, you can still get electrons past the bottleneck of complex I using it as a bypass. It can become lethal at a higher dose instead of acting as an electron cycler, so it actually replaces oxygen and competes with oxygen. The only currently FDA approved application is used for treating methemoglobinemia in the emergency room for someone who is exposed to carbon monoxide, acutely or even chronically over a longer period of time.",

Very controversial part of the study was the primary endpoint of that study was a neuroimaging outcome and the primary output failed… there was no difference on neuroimaging. But there was a secondary outcome on cognitive function in which a benefit was seen, which was about 15 percent. But are we being misled because the combination of methylene blue with other drugs obfuscates the results? Yes, however…",

  "date": "January 28, 2019",
  "context": "Cognitive Health & Neurodegenerative Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The study designers presented methylene blue as an anti-tau medication rather than as a metabolic enhancer acting on the mitochondria respiration. They found that it prevented the phosphorylation and agglutination of tau in vitro so they then infer or this an anti-tau agent. If you test methylene blue with immediate different compounds depending on the concentration of methylene blue because he has reducing or an oxidation action, it will interfere with all kinds of phenomena, so there is nothing specific about its effect on tau. So even though the data contradicted their hypothesis, they spun the story and results to fit their train of thought that this is an anti-tau agent. Current standard of care for AD patients: Due to the lack of approval by the FDA for things like methylene blue, there are being prescribed to AD patients which have no benefit to the patients AND cause side effects. The idea being, this is the standard of care and it would be “unethical” to take these patients off these agents even to allow them to enter another trial. Common drugs being prescribed: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (most common), Memantine (originally only for severe AD). Ineffectiveness of these common drugs: Subsequent meta-analyses all conclude very clearly that these are ineffective and they do not improve activities of daily living and that the disease continues to progress and people die. Problems with memantine, specifically: It is preventing some of the excited toxicity that is damaging hippocampal cells but you are essentially rescuing a dying a cell that is functionally incompetent. The problem with rescuing that dying cell is that you’re actually rescuing a cell that’s going to go on to send a signal that could cause more damage down the line. It is completely counterproductive and it’s based on the pathology oriented, that you can see more of these neurons they are when the people die.",

Challenges of the technology: Getting through the skull is not a challenge. Hemoglobin is the bigger challenge. Hemoglobin can absorb and reflect much of this light before it actually reaches the neurons.",
