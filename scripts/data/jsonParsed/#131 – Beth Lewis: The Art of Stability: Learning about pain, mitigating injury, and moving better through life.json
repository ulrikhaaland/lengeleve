Beth did a lot of breathing work with Peter because he was also presenting with a pretty significant bilateral rib flare. Beth calls the rib flaring Peter’s “strategy” for moving through life (basic walking, deadlift, etc.). Peter’s QLs (big muscles in the lower part of your back) were locked and loaded 24/7 which explains the rib flaring, anterior tilt of the pelvis. This is not uncommon—Many people have restrictions that are preventing them from moving well, including locked quadratus lumborum muscles, rib flare, and anterior pelvic tilt. It can require a lot of time and practice to reverse such restrictions, which can make it difficult to get buy in for the process. The process is not as fun as bootcamp-style “crushing it” workouts, which also contributes to difficulty with buy in. Plus, exercising like this with restrictions can either make it more difficult to reverse any present restrictions or even make them worse. How does Beth keep clients motivated to keep going? First, she educates them the best she can, “I am very real.” Pointing out progress. She constantly points out the little improvements, taking progress photos, etc. Reminding clients of wins, such as Peter’s alleviation of sacroiliac joint pain, helps.",
