About 60% of the ECF is Interstitial fluid which is therefore only about 20% of all water in the body.

The way we think about this in human physiology is all relative to the concentration of a cell, because the cell is the dominant source of water. There are three types of tonicity: Isotonic – This would be if you put those red blood cells into a solution that has the same tonicity as them. Hypertonic – if you put the red blood cells into a very concentrate solution we would call that hypertonic. Hypotonic - if you put the red blood cells into a dilute solution we would call that hypotonic.",

They can be a little hypertonic in the case of head injuries, as you’re trying to reduce the swelling in their brains, or as you’re trying to suck fluid out.

Dehydration can also impact glucose and electrolyte levels. If you are dehydrated, you are likely not replacing glucose, which is the most important thing we need to be replenishing while exercising along with electrolytes.

The concentration of glucose there is low relative to the concentration of glucose in the body. To get glucose in, it has to move up its gradient. Conversely, sodium concentration is higher there than it is on the inside of the cell. Sodium concentration, intracellularly, is very low, just as potassium concentration outside of the cell is very low. There is a synergy energetically by bringing glucose in and coupling it to bringing sodium in. When you move sodium and glucose across their gradients, which are opposite, one is up, one is down, you facilitate that better. Two sodium ions moving with one glucose molecule is a very efficient way to do this. That movement of sodium into the cells also draws water into the epithelial cell, which then moves water into the extracellular fluid as sodium is then pumped into the extracellular system via that sodium, potassium pump at the bottom of the picture, what we call the basolateral cell.",

The fructose one would be a lot sweeter. But the fructose one would actually result in a lot of gastric distress, even at isocaloric levels relative to glucose. There was just more difficulties absorbing it and emptying from the gut. Then you also look at other types of glucose that are complex such as maltodextrin. Maltodextrin, common in sports drinks, is just a huge oligomer made up of glucose. It’s effectively like glycogen and it’s easier to get more glucose in through maltodextrin because it does exit the stomach a little bit slower.",

We’ve established that you need sodium because you’re losing it. Obviously, we need glucose for long enough activity amount, but how much? An interesting study looked at this and concluded that at a ratio of about 2.0 you see the maximal water absorption. But a ratio of 2.0 can be different things. It could be glucose concentration of 200, sodium concentration of 100. What turns out to be the right number? It turns out that about 110 to 120 millimole of glucose and about 60 millimole of sodium gets us there.",

Better options include LMNT, Nuun, Liquid IV. It’s probably the case that Liquid IV results in the greatest amount of water absorption because it’s pairing and coupling glucose to sodium. It’s also providing you with glucose—so if you’re doing something where you need the glucose, then that’s probably the one to turn to.
