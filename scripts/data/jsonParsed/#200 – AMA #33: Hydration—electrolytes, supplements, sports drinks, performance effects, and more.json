If you put water into a hypotonic solution, there’s going to be an influx of water into the cells and they’ll eventually swell, swell, swell until they actually would rupture. NOTE: The tonicity of pure water is essentially zero. If you just infused water into somebody’s vascular system, you would rupture all the cells in their body. When we give IV fluids, we have to give them relatively close to isotonic solutions. They don’t have to be always isotonic. They can be a little hypertonic in the case of head injuries, as you’re trying to reduce the swelling in their brains, or as you’re trying to suck fluid out. You can also give slightly hypotonic solutions if a person already has too many electrolytes on board. They have their sodium levels are getting too high and things like that. But as a general rule, you’re starting from the baseline of giving an isotonic solution, which is 0.9% sodium chloride. And then you can adjust up or down with how much sodium chloride is in there and also how much other minerals, ions are in there along with things like glucose, which contribute to tonicity as well.",

  "content": "What are some of the most important solutes for determining the tonicity of blood? Are there certain things that are more important than others? There’s kind of like the 80/20 rule here, which is what contributes to the lion’s share of tonicity within the human physiologic system? The lion’s share of this is contributed by sodium and it’s counterion chloride. Sodium chloride (salt) is what accounts for about 85% of the tonicity of the extracellular space. The other things that contribute to it are glucose and blood urea nitrogen. If you’ve ever had a blood test done, you’ve probably noticed one of the things that shows up on your chemistry panel says BUN (it’s always pronounced by its initials, BUN) that’s the amount of nitrogen coming from the urea, which is part of the waste product of the urea cycle, which is how we get rid of excess protein. The general formula which gets you very close to estimate a person’s plasma osmolality: Plasma osmolality = 2[Na+] + (Glucose / 18) + (Blood Urea Nitrogen / 2.8). So it’s 2x the sodium concentration (it’s basically like saying the sodium and you double it up because sodium is always attached to chloride) plus the glucose concentration in milligrams per deciliter divided by 18 (and that’s correcting for the molar weight) plus the blood urea nitrogen concentration (similar units) divided by 2.8 (which again is a correction for the molecular weight) and that gives you something between about 275 and 295 milliosmoles per kilogram. The way I think about this is usually milliequivalents per liter or molarity, which is millimoles per liter (But again, for these nondissociable solutes, those are all equivalent). For a non-dissociable solute, osmolarity (mOsm/L) = normality (mEq/L) = molarity (mmol/L). Peter will probably refer to them as milliequivalents per liter going forward, but he might refer to it as molarity. Above is complicated, so the thing you want to really remember is that an isotonic solution to human plasma is going to be in the ballpark of about 280 milliequivalents per liter or millimoles per liter. And this will become important as we start to think about rehydration and where we need to be in relation to that.",

For relatively short duration activity, you really don’t need glucose as you should have sufficient muscle glycogen and liver glycogen to meet all your needs.

In the extreme example, if he were trying to break the world record in a marathon, he would absolutely need glucose under those conditions.

If there’s glucose in it, that’s fine, but it’s not as necessary is having the electrolytes. Today, if Peter is doing zone 2 for an hour, he’s either doing plain water or water + electrolytes, but no glucose.

Today, we have very good data, and the data is that a glucose containing solution of about 5% to 6% is the sweet spot. Anything that has a higher concentration than that is basically going to be a little bit too rich. And in fact, it’s going to start to become hypertonic.

For the Liquid IV, LMNT, Nuun, and other mixes… mixing them according to the directions that they provide is smart as they’ve generally done a lot of work on this and they sort of know the optimal plays. For Peter personally, he actually dilutes the mixes just slightly to remove some of the flavor since he actually prefers the taste of water when exercising. If using glucose in your fluids, look for the 2:1 glucose to sodium concentration. “Anytime I’m not drinking [plain] water, there’s really a purpose that I’m trying to serve in terms of glucose and/or electrolyte replacement and improving hydration status and water absorption.” —Peter Attia",
