  "content": "The market for substitutes wouldn’t exist if sugar had not become, in recent decades, inextricably linked to metabolic dysfunction and disease. Sugar is often delineated by “natural” sugars found in fruit and vegetables as opposed to “artificial” sugars that are added to food products like high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). By the time any type of sweetener leaves the stomach, it’s basically a series of monomers of glucose and fructose. The intestines and liver don’t care if these molecules were originally present in the food that was eaten or added later. It’s a question of density and volume, which both contribute to dose. It’s also a function of the rate at which the molecule moves through the upper digestive tract and, specifically, the speed with which they arrive at your liver (velocity). Fiber plays an important role here. Unlike most carbohydrates, fiber is largely not digested by the human body but is metabolized by bacteria in the colon. It slows digestion of other carbs, which is why it’s better to eat sugar with fiber.",

  "title": "Health Effects of Allulose",
  "date": "December 6, 2020",
  "context": "Sugar",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Allulose is on the top of my preference list for both objective and subjective reasons. The molecule has been around for a long time (found naturally in small quantities in some fruits), but it was only in 2014 that it was given a generally regarded as safe (GRAS) food designation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although it is functionally classed as a carbohydrate, allulose is mostly absorbed in the small intestine without being converted into energy: at least 90% is excreted by the kidneys without being metabolized. This means that in a functional sense allulose has 95% fewer calories than sucrose. Data from animal studies suggest that compared to fructose and/or glucose, allulose may lower blood glucose, reduce abdominal fat, decrease insulin resistance and fat accumulation in the liver, and prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. In a recent meta-analysis of human trials, when allulose was given with carbohydrate-containing meals, it was found to decrease postprandial glucose by 10%. Allulose-specific literature suggests that the compound does not have many side effects. Animal studies have found no toxicity at high doses. And while some people experience digestive issues after consuming allulose, they are usually temporary and mild, especially when compared to other sugar substitutes, such as alcohol sugars.",
