  "content": "The review article from the NEJM—'Effects of Intermittent Fasting on Health, Aging, and Disease'—describes the potential mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects—metabolic switching and stress resistance chiefly among them. The authors go on to describe the reported effects of so-called intermittent fasting (IF) on health and disease, and finish with recommendations for how health care providers can help their patients implement this eating pattern to treat or prevent a number of metabolic maladies.",

  "content": "One of the aforementioned mechanisms, metabolic switching, refers to the preferential shift from the use of glucose as a fuel source to the use of fatty acids and ketone bodies. Your ability to toggle back and forth between these two metabolic states is an indicator of your metabolic flexibility.",

  "title": "Benefits of Intermittent Fasting",
  "date": "January 19, 2020",
  "context": "Fasting",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The authors question how much of the benefit of IF is due to metabolic switching and how much is due to weight loss, which often, but not always, accompanies fasting. They point out that many studies have indicated the benefits of IF are independent of its effects on weight loss. They also emphasize that ketone bodies produced from fasting are not only used for fuel, but are also signaling molecules that have profound effects on metabolism and are known to influence health and aging.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "What is the level of ketosis one must reach in order to elicit these benefits? The minimum threshold appears to be about 1 mM, at least in mice. This raises the question of whether different types of fasting achieves levels above this threshold. According to the authors, plasma ketones generally increase to 0.2-0.5 mM during the first 24 hours of fasting.",

  "date": "January 19, 2020",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Given the importance put on ketone bodies by the authors, it’s surprising that very few trials in humans measure plasma ketones during IF, TRF, or ADF. But if it takes 24 hours for ketones to reach up to 0.5 mM, and the beneficial threshold is 1 mM, it suggests there may be a dosing problem with some forms of fasting. This raises the possibility that the metabolic switch isn’t occurring in some types of TR.",

In a different trial, a one-week 5:2 IF regimen in 19 healthy female participants, in the morning after the full (and non-consecutive) days of fasting (about 36 hours of fasting), self-measured BHB levels were 2.58 and 1.14 mM, respectively.",

  "content": "Studies on time-restricted feeding (TRF), intermittent fasting (IF), and alternate day fasting (ADF) are small and short-term. It is undetermined whether the results are reproducible and what happens when people engage in these regimens long-term. Questions remain about whether people improve their metabolic flexibility during long-term TRF, IF, and ADF, whether the levels and utilization of ketones increase over time, and whether one regimen works better than the others. The effects of a ketogenic diet in relation to these fasting regimens are also unclear. More and longer studies are needed that look at different forms of restriction and measure ketone levels.",
