So he would have someone watch his eye patterns while he slept and then wake him up immediately following his REM cycle: if you are woken up during REM you will feel sleepy — if your REM cycles were only 90 minutes, as opposed to say 2.5 hours, you could win RAAM.",

Check your assumptions at the door. Be open to all possibilities and realize that not everything you’ve been told is right. Know when to push, and when to pull back. If you are an ultra distance athlete you HAVE to be fat adapted. Don’t want to be doing this with an respiratory quotient above .75 to .8.",

Experimented with fat for energy, like coconut oil. Peter says to Mike “you were ahead [of the curve] with fat”. Started to notice that he could actually feel and perform better when fasted. Started to phase things out: carbs, alcohol. After reading a great book, Climbing Light, Fast, and High, he learned that taking a shot of olive oil in altitude is better than carbs. Applied it to his training, oil is more energy dense. “Sugar is like a drug, if you have Twix at mile 20, you’ll want another at mile 25”. Peter adds, “You’re hosed: you have now committed to a pure glycolytic strategy, and you better have it timed perfectly to the finish line”.",

  "content": "In 2002, spent some time in Tibet, the Himalayas, he was on Everest for a couple months and they were eating Yak meat, which you can’t cook in altitude, so when he came back in 2003, he had parasites. Doctor gave him meds, but also told Mike that historically our ancestors would fast to deal with parasites. Mike did a 10-day fast, combined with the meditation, only drank warm water. Day 1 and 2 was brutal, by day 3 it was “like 170-degree vision . . . I could see around myself . . . I could feel stuff . . . I could smell stuff” (in ketosis). Not only did it fix his parasite problem, he was also developing exercise-induced asthma, became allergic to certain foods, and all this went away in 2003, by fasting. By day 7 he started training again because he felt good. He then realized if he used oil and fasting, he could perform even better by just “throwing everything else out the window”. Peter says there’s little downside to try fasting, coupled with medical therapy, for parasites. Peter also says there’s certainly evidence to suggest that fasting coupled with chemo helps chemo work better, demonstrated by Valter Longo and Dom D’Agostino (note: Longo’s done more work with fasting and response to chemotherapy; D’Agostino’s focus is more on a ketogenic diet in combination with hyperbaric oxygen therapy)",

Peter’s wake up call was in 2010 when a friend of his, Nick Venuto, won the Mount Palomar time trial a couple times, was killed in a freak accident when a car hit him from behind. Peter had almost taken that same route that day, but decided by simple chance to go another way. Mike was hit by a car once, most mentally scary, 2006, maybe 2007. Went over the hood, hit his head, and couldn’t move one side of his body, really shook him up. He had a hard time getting back on the bike so he bought a CompuTrainer.",

Never had to unclip. Finished in 10 hours 40 minutes. 25.7 mph average. Felt fantastic at the end, thought about continuing to cross the next state. Looked at his Polar HR monitor when he finished, couldn’t believe the numbers: 10.5 hours and “it was fun”. He didn’t have a power meter, but Peter estimates Mike was doing 310-320 watts on avg. Peter says this in line with the professionals, estimating Mike’s FTP (Functional Threshold Power) to be 380-400. Pros look at the metric of watts per kilo.",

In an Air Force study, they put pilots into a simulator and measured performance over 24 hours. Placebo group predictably declined over time. Caffeine group did better for longer but crashed at some point. Modafinil group at a 200 mg standard dose had performance maintained for a long time but fell off at about 24 hours. Stimulants can add an advantage, but you better know when to use them, and for how long, because you can fall off a cliff pretty quickly.",

  "content": "For Mike, it really all started because he was “running away from stuff”. In 1997, he was living on a friends couch, drinking beer every night after work, he was dealing with a bad break up, and he just decided he had to get out of there. In 1998, he started to train for the NYC marathon. But then it evolved, Chicago marathon, NYC marathon dressed as Batman. Then realized that he might have an ability to pull off some decent times. People always ask, what do you think about when you’re out there for so long? Do you get bored? “No, it’s very meditative for me”. A time to think and work through stuff past and present. Mike describes long distance running as his happy place, the only time he feels normal. People ask, is it worth the sacrifice? Mike calls it a privilege, “if it was a sacrifice, I wouldn’t do it”. “I don’t choose a path of accepting that I have certain limitations and certain things aren’t possible, I think that’s bullshit”. Mike says he was “really good at saying no” back then, “If it wasn’t on the critical path, I wouldn’t do it”. For months at a time, he would cut off communication with family so he could focus. The new priority order is family, company, then training. Mike got married and found that during long training sessions he was asking himself, “What am I doing out here?”",
