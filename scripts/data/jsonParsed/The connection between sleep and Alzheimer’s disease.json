  "content": "Sleep disruption could be a biomarker of dementia, or even an underlying cause. Sleep may be one of the most significant lifestyle factors that determines your risk ratio for Alzheimer’s disease. Poor sleep could lead to neuronal energy deprivation. Sleep impacts oxidative stress. Insufficient sleep increases oxidative stress leading to neuronal death. The hippocampus, which is involved in memory, is the first to be damaged in Alzheimer’s.",

  "context": "Cognitive Health & Neurodegenerative Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The brain has a sanitation system similar to the lymphatic system that kicks in during deep sleep. This system washes out metabolic waste from the brain. β-amyloid, a core protein in Alzheimer’s formation, is one of the things washed away by this system. Lack of sleep or fragmented sleep leads to immediate β-amyloid buildup. Depriving a human of deep sleep for one single night can lead to a significant increase in circulating levels of amyloid and tau the next day.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There could be different susceptibilities to sleep deprivation among people with different genotypes. Alzheimer’s is a complex disease with genetic predisposition and multiple pathways driving injury to the brain. In the future, there could be at least 5 subtypes of Alzheimer’s. Tau accumulation can also result from sleep insufficiency. Insufficient sleep is a strong predictor for Alzheimer’s risk.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The four pillars of sleep are regularity (consistency of schedule), continuity (waking up many times per night?), quantity (in total, and in each stage), and quality (how good the electrical signature of sleep is; caffeine, alcohol, etc. can have an effect on quality). Different sleep features will be predictive of different aspects of the amyloid pathology cascade in Alzheimer’s.",
