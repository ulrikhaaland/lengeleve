  "content": "Could sleep disruption be a biomarker of dementia, or even an underlying cause? “Based on the weight of the data that we have, the evidence, I think it is causal. I think that sleep, at this stage, may be one of the most significant lifestyle factors that determines your risk ratio for Alzheimer’s disease. I feel the causal evidence for that now in humans and animals is strong enough to make that statement. And I don’t make that statement lightly.” The first thing is that we see that within insufficient sleep, you get increases in oxidative stress and that leads to a whole cascade of things that lead to neuronal death. Hippocampus (memory) 1st damaged in Alzheimer’s (forgetfulness). β-amyloid is one of things washed away, a core protein in Alzheimer’s formation which escalates Alzheimer’s risk. PET scan to map β-amyloid in brain: obvious difference. If 7 hrs of sleep or less, there is marked difference in amount of β-amyloid built up compared to 7 hrs or more. Just an association, but when animals (rats) deprived of sleep or sleep is fragmented, get immediate β-amyloid buildup. Take deep sleep away from a human for one single night and you can see significant increase in circulating levels of amyloid and tau the next day. They still get 8 hours total, but you selectively take away their non REM deep sleep by playing auditory tones. Their “sewage system” never kicks into gear to clear those proteins out.",
