  "content": "When you are sleep deprived, the brain receives a signal that is not dissimilar to starvation, releasing a cascade of hormones that change your appetite profile. This leads to increased hunger levels and less satisfaction after eating. The hormone ghrelin, which makes you want to eat more, increases, while leptin, which gives you a feeling of fullness, is suppressed. This creates a 'fake starvation signal' that makes you want to eat more and exercise less, leading to weight gain.",
