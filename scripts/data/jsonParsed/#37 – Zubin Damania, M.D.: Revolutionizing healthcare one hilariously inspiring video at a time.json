Organisms that see any aspect of reality as it is, go extinct in just a few generations because it requires energy to actually see reality in all its complexity. Organisms that see reality as a fitness icon designed to help them reproduce will thrive. As humans, we have evolved a shorthand hack in how we see the world to help us survive… i.e. I see something wet that I know that if I drink it I will not die. So is there a reality? Yes, there is an objective reality, but our visual cortex is simply constructing the world second-to-second in our minds every day. Based on what? In quantum mechanics, it’s pretty clearly established that there is no such thing as local realism…in other words, something doesn’t exist until it’s interacting with a conscious observer. What is it that we are interfacing with? (Dr. Hoffman answers this question in his TED Talk)",

Peter has a great talk about objective/strategy/tactics ⇒ Reverse engineered approach to human longevity. Objective: ⇒ Live longer than I am otherwise on a trajectory to live, which means I have to delay the onset of the things that will kill me. Cognition=Delaying neurodegenerative disease. The maintenance of muscle mass, the ability to move and maintain mobility and stability, freedom from pain, sexual function, the ability to be happy, having the highest degree of “distress tolerance” possible. Mindfulness and meditation becomes the single most important tool to impact that. Also important is social support and sense of purpose. For most people, if you took those things away from them, they wouldn’t want to live one more minute. Challenges of this approach: The Efficacy Problem: Figuring out the optimal way for an individual to eat, the good news being there is a finite number of iterations you can make until you start to converge on it. The Effectiveness Problem: By far the more challenging problem, which is finding a nutrition problem that actually works for the person, logistically or practically. Peter is a perfect example of the effectiveness problem, he knows he does best on a ketogenic diet but he simply doesn’t want to eat keto anymore, so this strategy is no longer “effective” for him. Peter’s nutritional framework: There is a spectrum. One end is the SAD, The Standard American Diet. The other end is complete caloric restriction (water only, obviously not sustainable, this should be cycled). In between those two ends of the spectrum, Peter says there are 3 other steps. It’s one thing to figure out how to optimize a person based on how they cycle between those layers, but the harder part is figuring out how to make that the default, as opposed to something you have to work into. How do we make it our default? Peter says he’s Influenced by Nudge by Dick Thaler. The easier you can make something for someone, the easier it’s going to be to do.",

Molecules that mimic caloric restriction include: Metformin and Rapamycin.

If you think about fasting as a drug: How long should you fast for (dose)? How often should you fast (frequency)? Furthermore, do you need to go all the way?

  "content": "Peter Attia's creative process for writing lyrics involves listening to the original song, coming up with notes, and hitting certain points. He also uses exercise to help clear his mind and allow ideas to surface. He finds that having a structure in the song helps him excel and uses RhymeZone to hone his lyrics. The rewriting process is crucial and can take up to a month. The recording process takes a couple of days with 30+ takes, and Peter takes voice lessons to reduce the number of takes needed.",
