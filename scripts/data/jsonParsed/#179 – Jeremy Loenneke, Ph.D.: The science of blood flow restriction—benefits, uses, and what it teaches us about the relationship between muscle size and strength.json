The type I fiber has lots of mitochondria surrounding the myofibrils within the sarcomere. It can readily access energy via oxidation of glucose and fatty acids using aerobic respiration.

The term KAATSU is synonymous with blood flow restriction, and it’s Japanese for training with increasing pressure. More accurately, it’s a brand of apparatus used for this technique. Shinohara published the first paper in 1998; they had subjects do leg exercises with blood flow restriction on one leg but not the other; greater change was observed in the limb with blood flow restriction. The idea of blood flow restriction is to reduce blood flow going into the limb but not completely occlude blood flow.

  "content": "The current method is to begin by taking the cuff up to the lowest pressure for which there is no blood flow at all; then change the pressure to a percentage of that. This ensures some blood flow during exercise. One could use ultrasound, use a handheld Doppler Probe that’s essentially detecting the pulse to determine the pressure at which there is no blood flow (arterial occlusion pressure or AOP). Take for example the ankle; before doing any exercise, the patient simply lies down, the cuff is slowly inflated until blood flow isn’t heard; note the pressure and take a percentage of it. If the arterial occlusion pressure measured is 100 mmHg, then typically use anywhere between 40-80 mmHg. The AOP is the lowest pressure for which there is no blood flow. The cuff size used for blood flow restriction matters; it will change the pressure. Pressure and force are related by the area that the cuff takes up; so the wider the cuff, the lower the pressure needed to reach occlusion. Some think a wider cuff is better because a lower pressure can be used, but this is not true; it’s all relative. If the AOP is 100 mmHg, then 40-80% of this is a wide range. Exercising at 40 mmHg versus 80 mmHG may be the difference  between comfort and discomfort.",

Some people are going to experience that as more discomfort than other people. This doesn’t necessarily mean the blood flow is reduced by 40% either; that is different. The blood flow may differ from person to person depending on how big the muscle is and a variety of other things. There are some people who perceive almost everything as extreme discomfort; the discomfort they feel at 40 is not different than it is at 80 because they already rated it so high; there are people on the opposite side who rate the discomfort low too.

If one cannot achieve 30 reps on the first set, then the load is probably too high or the wraps are too tight. If there is pain before exercising, then it’s too tight. In practical use of restriction, he uses a knee wrap; he doesn’t know how much pressure is being applied. In a clinical setting or for rehabilitation, it’s important to know what pressure is being applied. For a healthy person going to the gym, knowing the pressure is not that important. In this discussion, if the load is low and one is in pain after applying the wraps, then the wraps are too tight. Loosen the wraps and one should get close to 30 reps on the first set, then close to 15 reps on the last 3 sets. This will depend on strength; one might fail pretty quick in the 4th set.

One is not building up a tremendous amount of metabolites. This is probably not providing a tremendous amount adaptation either.

  "content": "What other metrics could people use if they don’t have access to a Doppler to determine the pressure? Systolic blood pressure is not always the same as occlusive pressure. If the size of the cuffs are similar (for both applying pressure and measuring systolic blood pressure) then systolic blood pressure could be used as a basis for determining % pressure. For the average gym-goer, it’s simpler to apply the wrap as a percentage of resting limb size. There is some data on this working with people who come into the clinic to learn exercises to do at home; in the clinic a device is used to set the occlusive pressure to 40%; they are told to mimic this pressure at home. Some are successful but this can vary between 20-50% AOP; not terrible but also not great. This idea was based on a paper a long time ago that said the pressure should rate a 7 out of 10 to be sure it is subocclusive. The range for this is huge; one day a person may be at 90% AOP and the next day the same feeling might be 10% AOP. This scale isn’t recommended anymore. When conditioning is the goal, use a percentage of resting circumference and then use repetitions as a guide. Peter doesn’t have nice cuffs, but the thing he likes is they have numbers on them; this gives him a sense of how tight to wrap them.",

The safety profile overall is comparable to that of high load exercise or traditional exercise. Two common concerns are blood clotting and muscle damage. Everything carries with it a risk. Blood flow restriction does not appear to increase the risk of blood clots or muscle damage. One will be sore after performing exercise under blood flow restriction, but when one looks at the muscle fiber it appears to be intact; there does not appear to be structural damage. There is not a whole lot of difference in CK levels between the same exercise without blood flow restriction. There is certainly soreness but not structural damage. Compared to the same exercise without blood flow restriction, blood pressure is usually higher but comparable to (or even a little lower) than high load exercise. Compared to high load exercise, blood pressure is similar and usually comes back down to baseline within five minutes in healthy individuals. Certain populations may hyper-respond, so that is something to consider. With BFR exercise he’s never got the feeling like his head’s going to pop off his shoulders, which he commonly feels when doing a heavy deadlift. But I would say that overall, it does appear to be very safe – Jeremy Loenneke. In the studies that have been done, it appears to be relatively safe. As with anything, for example, when giving a drug in a large clinical trial, one will start to see some side effects that were never seen before.

Neural changes occur first followed by large contributions from muscle hypertrophy. Jeremy has done research in the low load realm and has begun to see that perhaps muscle hypertrophy does not increase strength. He almost always see muscle growth which is similar to or equivalent to that of high load exercise, but the strength (assuming that we’re not practicing the test repeatedly) is almost always less. The correlation or association between strength and size is equally strong in the untrained as it is in the trained. The question here is, when a person begins to exercise and then they get stronger, is that due to changes in muscle size? It makes sense that it would, actin (protein) is increasing so why would this not produce increased strength. However, there are numerous times in the literature where greater changes in muscle size occur but strength doesn’t change.

Jeremy questions the logic that assumes hypertrophy is responsible for increasing strength and suggests that it needs to be more rigorously tested.",

  "content": "Peter notes that blood flow restriction seems to provide an elegant tool to test the hypothesis that increasing muscular strength is not dependent on increasing the size of the muscle. Jeremy suggests that workouts where they only do 1-5 reps of an exercise could uncouple the metrics of strength and hypertrophy. Athletes who try to maximize strength and minimize hypertrophy train with a trap bar, they do not do the eccentric motion, and they lift the weight up and drop it.",

  "content": "One group trains doing a 1RM test (repetition maximum); they come in and work up to about 5 reps in total then go home. In this group they are trying to maximize the strength signal but not get growth. This group should show what strength looks like if muscle growth does not occur. Compare this to the traditional training group; they would do about 8-12 reps of a very simple movement, the bicep curl. In this group both muscle growth and increased strength is observed. Most articles would conclude that since muscle growth is observed, that muscle growth must be contributing to strength. In the study described above, he found that first group got stronger without increasing muscle size while the second group experiences both increased strength and increased muscle size; but the strength increase was the same in both groups. He expects to see a greater separation when assessing more complex movements. If doing a barbell bench press (a very, very simple movement) he would expect the group doing 1RM to be far better than the group doing 8-12 reps. His results suggest that change in muscle size is not necessary for a change in strength nor does it appear to be contributing given that the strength is the same in these 2 groups.",

  "content": "Limitations – in order to get that differential in growth, they had to apply slightly different exercise patterns. One group was doing 8 to 12 reps, it’s still a high load but not 100%; where as the other group was training at 100%. Some suggest this is not a fair comparison. There are more differences than simply muscle growth in these 2 groups; others have suggests they follow-up on these with mediation analysis to look at how much of this change relative to a control is driven by muscle size within each group individually. When they did this, they did not see any mediation, meaning that none of the change in strength could be explained by that change in muscle size in either one of the groups. Mediation analysis – There are some statistical approaches where one can look at the relationship between 2 exercise groups; instead of looking at them head to head, compare them individually to a group that is not exercising at all. This can control for many factors: random error across time, measurement noise, random biological variation, etc. Jeremy explains mediation analysis as “saying “Okay, we have this group here. How much strength did they gain?” So they got stronger. That’s a direct relationship. So when this group exercised, they got stronger. Now, mediation says, “Okay, let’s add in a variable here to see if we can remove this relationship [between exercise and increased strength] either partially or completely.” When muscle growth is added to this model it no longer correlates with strength; this indicates the relationship is driven by another variable, not muscle growth. He didn’t expect a complete correlation between muscle growth and strength, but he did expect a  partial correlation. No correlation between strength and muscle growth was seen in either group. Peter asks “Is the contrapositive then that it’s not at all coupled?” His intuition would be that there is an association, not 100% causal; the R2 value might be 0.5 not 0.99. He would not guess no association or a negative association or one-to-one causal association. Mediation analysis could show if there were partial mediation; but none was observed. They didn’t see any effect at all. There are other potential reasons, random error with measurements cannot be ruled out. Jeremy does see an accumulation of evidence suggesting that if muscle growth does play a role in strength, it is so small that they are not able to detect it. “I am not sure that muscle growth in response to exercise is a mechanism [for increasing strength]. I’ve seen no experimental evidence that suggests that that’s the case.” – Jeremy Loenneke.",

What was learned from these experiments in terms of increasing one’s strength? There is a huge specificity component; train a good portion of time at or close to 1RM. If strength is desired for squatting or deadlift; then spend time training at 1RM with these exercises. Training to increase muscle growth typically requires a lot of recovery because a large volume of exercise is required to make a muscle grow.",

  "content": "If strength is the goal, then perhaps less time can be devoted to high repetition exercise. Jeremy is performing more experiments to address the role of (or lack thereof) muscle growth in increasing muscle strength. No one disputes the neurologic component; is there another mechanism? Some have the opinion that the exercise-induced changes are probably predominantly neural; Jeremy’s not there yet. He thinks there could be some local changes at the muscle, and that might be able to explain why some groups get stronger; that it’s not just neural. Perhaps the muscle at the local level gets better at responding to forceful contractions. Maybe there are qualitative alterations in the local muscle that are not due to muscle size such as how the muscle deals with calcium and how the myosin head binds. Jeremy thinks the usual argument isn’t fair – “Well, if muscle growth is not a mechanism, then what exactly is it?” One doesn’t explain something by stating “We don’t have a lot of evidence for this, and there’s a lot of evidence against this”. He does think there is a neural component to developing strength, he also thinks there may be molecular changes in the muscle other than growth but he hasn’t identified this yet.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "It’s becoming more common; at Ole Miss and many Division 1 schools, a large portion of the athletic departments have blood flow restriction devices. They are using them for rehab. He’s seen players in the NBA and the NFL using BFR. For both rehab and everyday training. Perhaps they recover a little quicker using BFR. They perceive it as a way to get a workout in without having to spend so much time recovering. This isn’t known. But it appears that when athletes are injured and working out with BFR, they get more out of it and have less pain during movement. The goal of a bodybuilder, not being judged on strength, is to build volume; Peter discussed this with Layne on the podcast and he explained “Look, at the end of the day, the volume is what’s going to matter”. This can be accomplished with isolated movements. Using compound movements requires lots and lots of volume across these kinds of ranges. Jeremy thinks BFR could be a valuable tool for bodybuilders depending on how they feel any given day. If one is not feeling good and has a heavy day at the gym, they could use BFR to achieve similar training with lighter weights. On days one isn’t feeling focused lifting heaving weights can be dangerous; using BFR is an option to improve safety because lighter weights are used and it doesn’t require as much focus. He thinks BFR can be used to promote muscle growth. BFR can help with exercise variety. If one is hurt, evidence is accumulating that it is helpful in rehabilitation. “It’s important to note that if a person’s not comfortable with it, they don’t have to do blood flow restriction in order to optimize how much muscle that they can grow. But it is a tool that could be potentially quite effective for them.” – Jeremy Loenneke. Peter thinks BFR is a great way to mix up training. It’s a tool for people who don’t have the technique to do heavier lifts. It’s an alternative to painful, Super Slow training. Jeremy was never really interested in Super Slow training. He never felt like he was going to get very strong with that method. The movement is slow and the weight is usually light so he questions how transferable this exercise is.",

Peter assumes that one reason why BFR can produce so much hypertrophy using a low load is the response to metabolic challenge. He tested lactate levels with and without BFR using blood from a pin-prick of his finger. When he occludes the arm and exercises, the lactate levels go through the roof at locations well distal to the occlusion. Lactate is a metabolic by-product of exercise, especially this type of exercise. Exercising under BFR is thought to trap lactate in the muscle where it may augment muscle activation.",

Exercise with low loads under BFR initially activates fewer muscle fibers, but as metabolites are trapped, more and more fibers are activated so ultimately a similar amount of fibers are activated compared to exercise with high load.",

For example, if a person fails at 8 reps with 80 lbs and 40 reps with 40 lbs; it simply means the 40 reps took longer to burn through the type I fibers and the type IIA’s and IIAB’s, and then at the end of the exercise the type IIX’s failed. Type IIX muscle fiber are fast twitch, produce the largest force, and are easily fatigued. They rely on anaerobic respiration which produces lactate. Type I and II fibers both grow in response to exercise: high load, low load, with or without BFR. At the extreme level, a body builder’s hypertrophy is explained by growth in both types of fibers.",
