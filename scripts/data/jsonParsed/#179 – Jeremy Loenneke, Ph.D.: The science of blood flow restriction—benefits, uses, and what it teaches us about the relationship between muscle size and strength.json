Blood flow restriction is a general term that applies to occluding some portion of the arterial inflow to a muscle. This allows an individual to exercise with a lower weight than they would normally use. Muscles are made of tubular fibers called myofibrils. The smallest unit is a sarcomere. Sarcomeres are made up of alternating thin and thick filaments. The thin filaments are made of actin, the thick filaments are made of myosin. Actin and myosin interact to cause muscle contraction; this happens during exercise. Contraction results in signaling for muscle adaptation.",

    "content": "Fast glycolytic muscles generate energy using anaerobic respiration and are used for high resistance exercise such as lifting heavy weights. Exercise can shift muscle to a different type, generally making the overall muscle fiber slower, more oxidative, and more efficient. The sarcomere, composed of fibers bordered by Z-lines, plays a crucial role in muscle contraction. When one decides to exercise, a signal goes from the nerve to the muscle, leading to a release of calcium which exposes binding sites. During muscle contraction, filaments slide past each other. Myosin interacts with actin to cause this movement, requiring ATP to break the bond between myosin and actin and to recock the myosin head then reattach to actin. This process requires more calcium. As long as calcium is present, or as long as signals for movement are being sent, the actin and myosin in sarcomeres will keep interacting producing muscle contraction.",

Blood flow restriction does not appear to increase the risk of blood clots or muscle damage.
