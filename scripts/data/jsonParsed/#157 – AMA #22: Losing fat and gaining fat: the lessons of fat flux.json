Common strategies such as fasting and low-carb diets can aid in the liberation and oxidation of fat from fat cells.",

However, there is a profound difference between losing fat via liposuction vs. through dietary & lifestyle interventions. The former is a cosmetic procedure, while the latter has cosmetic benefits but more importantly, a metabolic improvement.",

Nutritional ketosis is probably the fastest way to get into this state if you’re in a eucaloric state.

But the more important question is, do they lose weight because they’re eating less or are they eating less because they are losing weight? It’s possible that as a person is changing the endocrine environment of their fat cell, they are liberating more free fatty acid & creating more substrate availability to the rest of the body. This could be that the body is saying, “Oh, come to think of it, I just don’t need to eat as much.”",

They’re like, “Oh wow, I don’t feel the need to lay around in the afternoons.” Another endocrinologist, Edwin Astwood talked about “internal starvation”. If you see somebody who’s morbidly obese, it looks like that they probably can’t access that fat and they’re accumulating it. And if they can’t access it, they’re starving internally which means that they’re going to be hungrier and more lethargic because they literally have less energy to burn if it’s getting sequestered into the fat tissue.",

If you go back to the equation, De novo lipogenesis (DNL) + re-esterification (RE) = lipolysis (L) — That’s what we call fat balance. If we want to be in negative fat flux, then L needs to be bigger than DNL + RE. Nothing about being in ketosis tells us the inputs to that equation. Ketosis just tells you that you are making a lot of BHB, beta-hydroxybutyrate. If you’re restricting carbohydrates and you’re not starving yourself, it means you’re eating a lot of fat. And one cannot tell by looking at this equation if L is bigger than, or less than, RE.",
