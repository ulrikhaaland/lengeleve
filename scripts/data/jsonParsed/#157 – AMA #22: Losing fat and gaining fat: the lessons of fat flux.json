But as a person becomes more and more insulin resistant at the muscle, we will see more of the glucose entering the fat cell via the GLUT4 transporter and then insulin is promoting lipogenesis.

If mobilization is exceeding deposition, then you’re looking at that negative fat flux or efflux. If deposition is exceeding mobilization, you are looking at positive fat flux or influx. There is no faster way to get into this state than fasting. Nutritional ketosis is probably the fastest way to get into this state if you’re in a eucaloric state.
