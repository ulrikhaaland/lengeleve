  "content": "Cholesterol is an essential organic molecule in our body. We eat it, we make it, we store it, and we excrete it. Cholesterol exists in 2 forms – unesterified or 'free' and esterified. The form determines if we can absorb it or not, or store it or not. Much of the cholesterol we eat is not absorbed and is excreted by our gut. The cholesterol we synthesize in our body is the dominant source of the cholesterol in our body. The process of regulating cholesterol is very complex and multifaceted with multiple layers of control. Eating cholesterol has very little impact on the cholesterol levels in your body.",

  "content": "Cholesterol and triglycerides are not soluble in plasma and are therefore said to be hydrophobic. To be carried anywhere in our body, they need to be carried by a special protein-wrapped transport vessel called a lipoprotein. As these lipoproteins leave the liver they undergo a process of maturation where they shed much of their triglyceride 'cargo' in the form of free fatty acid, and doing so makes them smaller and richer in cholesterol.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Cholesterol transport in plasma occurs in both directions, from the liver and small intestine towards the periphery and back to the liver and small intestine. The major function of the apoB-containing particles is to traffic energy (triglycerides) to muscles and phospholipids to all cells. Their cholesterol is trafficked back to the liver. The apoA-I containing particles traffic cholesterol to steroidogenic tissues, adipocytes (a storage organ for cholesterol ester) and ultimately back to the liver, gut, or steroidogenic tissue.",

Currently, most people undergo a 'standard' lipid panel, which only directly measures TC, TG, and HDL-C. LDL-C is measured or most often estimated. More advanced cholesterol measuring tests do exist to directly measure LDL-C, along with the cholesterol content of other lipoproteins or lipoprotein subparticles.",

  "content": "The progression from a completely normal artery to a 'clogged' or atherosclerotic one follows a very clear path: an apoB containing particle gets past the endothelial layer into the subendothelial space, the particle and its cholesterol content is retained, immune cells arrive, an inflammatory response ensues 'fixing' the apoB containing particles in place AND making more space for more of them. While inflammation plays a key role in this process, it's the penetration of the endothelium and retention within the endothelium that drive the process. If you want to stop atherosclerosis, you must lower the LDL particle number.",

There is no way of determining which individual patient may have discordant LDL-C and LDL-P without measuring both markers.

This drug, a cousin of torcetrapib called dalcetrapib, albeit a weaker CETP-inhibitor, appeared to do all the right stuff (i.e., it increased HDL-C) without the wrong stuff (i.e., it did not appear to adversely affect blood pressure). It did nothing to LDL-C or apoB. Currently, two additional CETP inhibitors, evacetrapib and anacetrapib are being evaluated. They are much more potent CETP inhibitors and, unlike dalcetrapib, also reduce apoB and LDL-C and Lp(a).",

As you can see in the figure below, the larger an HDL particle, the more cholesterol it carries. So, an equal number of large versus small HDL particles (equal HDL-P) can carry very different amounts of cholesterol (different HDL-C).",

They are in a constant state of acquiring cholesterol (lipidation) and delivering cholesterol (delipidation).

The vast majority of lipidation occurs (in order): 1) at the liver, 2) the small intestine, 3) adipocytes and 4) peripheral cells, including plaque if present. The liver and intestine account for 95% of this process.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "As I’ve argued before, while statins are efficacious at preventing heart disease, it’s sort of by luck as far as most prescribing physicians are concerned. Most doctors use cholesterol lowing medication to lower LDL-C, not LDL-P. Since there is an overlap (i.e., since the levels of LDL-P and LDL-C are concordant) in many patients, this misplaced use of statins seems to work ok. I, and many others far more knowledgeable, would argue that if statins and other drugs were used to lower LDL-P (and apoB), instead of LDL-C, their efficacy would be even greater. The same is true for dietary intervention.",

  "content": "A study published in Circulation in 2010 found that an increase in the number of HDL particles and smaller HDL particles decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease. The total number of HDL particles rose, and it was driven by increased small HDL-P. The cardiovascular benefit of the treatment (fibrate) was related to the rise in total HDL-P which was driven by the fibrates’ ability to raise small HDL-P. It seems the problem with the “HDL hypothesis” is that it’s using the wrong marker of HDL. By looking at HDL-C instead of HDL-P, these investigators may have missed the point. Just like LDL, it’s all about the particles.",

Secondary to the total HDL-P, all things equal it seems smaller HDL particles are more protective than large ones. As HDL-C levels rise, most often it is driven by a disproportionate rise in HDL size, not HDL-P. In the trials which were designed to prove that a drug that raised HDL-C would provide a reduction in cardiovascular events, no benefit occurred: estrogen studies, fibrate studies, niacin studies, and CETP inhibition studies. But, this says nothing of what happens when you raise HDL-P.",
