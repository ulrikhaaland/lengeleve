  "content": "An estimated 6.2 million Americans aged 65 and older have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and that number is on track to triple by 2050. Given the lack of therapeutics to prevent or delay AD, any reports of risk reduction strategies are worth a close look. A recent retrospective study indicates that an annual flu vaccine was associated with lower risk of AD. Flu vaccination is hypothesized to promote broader changes in the immune system, which in turn impacts AD pathogenesis. The immune system is generally conceptualized as two branches: innate immunity, with which we are born, and adaptive immunity, a system in which specialized cells develop “memory” of previous diseases, leading to faster and more specific reactions to pathogens in the future. Vaccines have more recently been recognized for their ability to impact innate immunity and induce non-specific protection against a broad range of pathogens – part of a phenomenon known as “trained immunity.” In addition to increasing the body’s ability to resist infection, these innate immune system changes may lower the risk for chronic inflammation and decrease neuroinflammation.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The retrospective study is by far the largest investigation on the topic to date, as well as the most rigorous in controlling for covariates known to increase AD risk. The investigators adopted a matched pair design, in which a total of just under 2 million flu-vaccinated and unvaccinated participants age 65 and older were matched based on similar covariates, demographics, medication usage, and comorbidities. Participants were included in the flu-vaccinated group if they had received between 1-6 flu vaccines in the six years leading into the study. The authors then followed patients for 4 years and measured the incidence of AD. The results showed that seniors who received at least one flu vaccine were 40% less likely than their non-vaccinated peers to develop AD in the 4-year follow-up period. Additionally, the inverse association between vaccination and AD incidence appeared to be dose-dependent, with more vaccines associated with higher protection from AD.",

  "title": "Flu Vaccines or Flu Infection?",
  "date": "November 12, 2022",
  "context": "Cognitive Health & Neurodegenerative Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "This is an observational epidemiology study, and it cannot address causality. The existence of a plausible mechanism in activating trained immunity bolsters the argument for causality, as does the apparent dose-dependency of the effect. But despite the authors’ attempts to match participants and correct for dozens of covariates, the study still leaves ample room for alternative interpretations. For one, this study leaves ample room for the influence of healthy user bias, a recurring theme in epidemiology studies. Those who regularly receive flu shots are likely more health-conscious overall, so perhaps they are less likely to develop AD for reasons unrelated to vaccination status – such as exercise or diet habits. The authors of this study did not include influenza infection in their analysis due to concerns over misclassification – a major limitation of this study. Common infections are reported to be associated with increased risk of dementia, but again, these data come from association studies that cannot establish causality.",

  "content": "No therapies have emerged that can reverse or cure AD, so identifying measures that may reduce the risk of onset is critical. While the study comes with many potential caveats and confounds, it does show that a link between flu vaccination and reduced risk of AD is at least plausible. And unlike expensive or invasive interventions, an annual flu vaccination is cheap, easy, and low-risk. More work needs to be done to understand if and how vaccines might protect against neurodegenerative disease. A randomized controlled trial would certainly provide more insight into the potential causality between flu vaccines and AD, but given the mortality risk of influenza, such a study is unlikely to be conducted for ethical reasons.",
