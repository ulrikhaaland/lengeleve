  "content": "An annual flu vaccine was associated with lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Flu vaccination is hypothesized to promote broader changes in the immune system, which in turn impacts AD pathogenesis. Trained immunity may impact AD pathogenesis. The retrospective study by Bukhbinder et al. is by far the largest investigation on the topic to date, as well as the most rigorous in controlling for covariates known to increase AD risk. Seniors who received at least one flu vaccine were 40% less likely than their non-vaccinated peers to develop AD in the 4-year follow-up period.",

  "content": "The study by Bukhbinder et al. shows a link between flu vaccination and reduced risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The inverse association between vaccination and AD incidence appeared to be dose-dependent, with more vaccines associated with higher protection from AD. Secondary analysis of the number of vaccines received by subjects in the 6-year look-back period compared the incidence of AD over the 4-year observation period in unvaccinated subjects, those receiving 3 flu vaccinations, and those receiving 6 flu vaccinations. The lowest incidence of AD was associated with 6 flu vaccines, or annual vaccination.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "If those who receive the vaccine are less likely to get the flu, could it be possible that, instead of flu vaccines reducing risk of AD, flu infection raises risk of AD? Injury to the brain can occur during an influenza infection from direct viral invasion or as a result of collateral damage from the systemic immune response, providing a potential pathway by which influenza could increase risk of AD, but the effect of flu infection on AD risk has received little attention. The authors of this study did not include influenza infection in their analysis due to concerns over misclassification – a major limitation of this study.",

  "content": "No therapies have emerged that can reverse or cure AD, so identifying measures that may reduce the risk of onset is critical. While the study by Bukhbinder et al. comes with many potential caveats and confounds, it does show that a link between flu vaccination and reduced risk of AD is at least plausible. And unlike expensive or invasive interventions, an annual flu vaccination is cheap, easy, and low-risk.",
