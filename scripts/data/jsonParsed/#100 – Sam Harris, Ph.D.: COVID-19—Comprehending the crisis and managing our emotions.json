Nobody is discounting the severity of influenza. However, influenza comes in a very predictable wave and the infection and mortality is spread out over the course of a year. But CV is still in exponential growth in new cases and there’s no evidence yet that we are on the back side of that curve where that has stabilized. And we don’t yet know what the absolute potential for mortality from coronavirus really is because it’s still in its infancy. If we could somehow “freeze” the new cases in their tracks, this CV situation would indeed look way less harmful compared to the flu. So the point is… what steps can we take to freeze this thing from spreading?",

Sam is concerned that people aren’t fully grasping the importance of stamping down the spread of this virus. Sam also acknowledges that even after just one week, the “shelter in place” order is beginning to unwind as people grow more restless. And this fact makes it pretty clear that the idea that sheltering for weeks, much less months, is a farfetched idea.",

Sam hopes that people (especially those with extreme libertarian views) will recognize the essential role of government. Peter adds that he hopes people will see that a public-private partnership is essential. Peter also says he’s optimistic that in the future, cities will take on some more of  the risk stratification and planning such that they aren’t waiting on the federal government or the CDC. Overall, Sam is hopeful that we’ve learned many lessons from the many things that have gone wrong in this crisis so that WHEN it happens again, we are more prepared.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "This is harder to vaccinate that things like polio, measles, or smallpox. The coronaviruses behave a bit more like RSV viruses which, to create enough immunity, you have to create a larger exposure. And the risk of the vaccine is higher—anytime you vaccinate somebody there’s a risk that they get sick from the vaccine. The perfect vaccine would be the vaccine for which you have no risk from the vaccine and you get perfect immunity… But the reality if you may never get there. In discussions with virologists, Peter says “we have to sort of caveat our optimism around how long it will take to make a vaccine for this and how safe it will be.” “This mirrors the type of virus for which vaccines have historically not been a great alternative because of the risk reward trade off.” says Peter. This brings up the important point that we have to be able to discuss this stuff openly and not get bogged down in unreasonable positions. I.e., the anti-vax movement which is largely based on a retracted paper.",
