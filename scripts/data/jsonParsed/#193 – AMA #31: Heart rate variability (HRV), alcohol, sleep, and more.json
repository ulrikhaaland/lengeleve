  "content": "HRV stands for heart rate variability. HRV measures the variation in time between heartbeats, and that’s measured in milliseconds. In other words, there is actually some variability. If you now measure the distance between the Rs—the RR interval—and you take the RMSSD (The Root Mean Square of Successive Differences between normal heartbeats)…that means you calculate the time difference between each RR interval. The RMSSD is obtained by first calculating each successive time difference between heartbeats (RR intervals) in ms. Then, each of the values is squared and the result is averaged before the square root of the total is obtained. So RMSSD is reported in milliseconds. If using wearables that calculate HRV while you’re sleeping, you’ll notice it gives you a number in milliseconds.",

It turns out that that variability is heavily influenced by which of the autonomic nervous systems is most dominant. The Autonomic system handles the unconscious processes (and even effects conscious behavior). Autonomic contains two branches – the Parasympathetic and the Sympathetic. Sympathetic is activated in times of stress. Parasympathetic is activated in times of recovery.",

There was no difference in CHD in the two groups. A meta-analysis from 2013 found that a low HRV (10th percentile) was associated with a 50% increased risk [1.50 (95% CI 1.22, 1.83)] of a first cardiovascular event in people without CVD compared to those in the 50th percentile.",

At 20 years old, the upper portion is about 105 milliseconds, the lower portion is about 60 milliseconds, the midpoint is about 80 milliseconds. By the time you’re 50, that midpoint is about 40 milliseconds, the lower point is about 30 milliseconds, the upper point is about 50 milliseconds.

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Let’s talk about two different things…First, is there a genetic difference between individuals in terms of alcohol consumption and alcohol metabolism? “No question. That’s a given.” The most obvious of that is people, and it’s almost always Asians, who have a deficiency of an enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase. They have certain alterations in coding regions for genes that produce that enzyme which is very important for metabolizing ethanol. The SNPs are in the ALDH2 gene, and they cause a huge reduction in this enzyme’s activity. If your heterozygous, you have mild symptoms. Homozygotes, meaning people who have two copies of this, usually can’t tolerate a single drink. Secondly, tolerance seems to go down as we age. College person having 10 drinks feels different than a middle aged person having the same, generally speaking. Peter suspects there are genetic differences here. We know for example, that we have very different metabolisms, genetically, for caffeine. That is also likely true in alcohol. There are different rates of alcohol metabolism that are genetic and it might be that those faster metabolizers are less impacted by the effect of alcohol on sleep. If you took two people, one is a fast metabolizer, one is a slow metabolizer. They both have three drinks, four hours before bed. One of them might be feeling the effects of all of that when they go to sleep, if they’re a slow metabolizer, the other might not be. Peter’s unsure what of the genetic SNPs that are responsible, so it’s probably something you just have figured out empirically as an individual. Would somebody who has developed a higher tolerance for alcohol through frequent consumption be able to metabolize it faster than they would if they hadn’t developed tolerance? There’s some evidence to suggest that chronic heavy drinkers (1–5 days weekly consumption of ≥5 drinks per occasion for men, ≥ 4 for women) absorb and metabolize alcohol faster than light drinkers (weekly drinkers who averaged consuming <6 drinks per week).",

  "content": "Especially in The Rotterdam Study—the study that makes the strongest case for drinking… The legal drinking age for alcohol in the Netherlands is currently 18, but in 2014 it was age 16. Culturally, this suggests the culture is one that probably drinks quite responsibly, a culture that doesn’t have a lot of problems with excessive alcohol consumption, and this is probably a culture where alcohol is integrated into every aspect of life. Therefore not drinking alcohol is probably a marker for something odd. It’s probably like not having a sauna in Finland, meaning there’s likely something fundamentally different about the person who lives in Finland and doesn’t sauna (or lives in Rotterdam and doesn’t drink). My takeaway for this is if alcohol brings you great pleasure and there’s no maladaptive negative in your life, it’s probably a wash to have some alcohol versus to have none. If alcohol is a maladaptive coping strategy for you, then I think abstinence does make a ton of sense.",

  "content": "When looking at the epi data suggesting moderate drinking is potentially better than no drinking, this could create an issue with the public health messaging: So, we’re talking about the consumption of alcohol, all-cause mortality and all these problems and we’re looking at groups and we’re saying moderate drinking is better than never drinking at all. As a public health figure, you might run into this issue of telling a population of people who have never touched alcohol to start drinking moderately when almost assuredly there is going to be some proportion of those people that are going to go on to drink beyond moderately, and they’re going to run into some problems especially when there are a lot of problems with the way these studies are designed. Chronic effects of alcohol on the liver -Peter had Chris Sonneday on the podcast in the past… Chris talked about how we’re actually seeing a rise in alcoholic liver disease, AFLD, as a cause for cellular carcinoma and/or liver transplant. The story about NAFLD being on the rise is well understood. It’s gone up by more than 2X in the last decade. But what’s almost not noticed is that the same is true for alcohol. So in 2010, alcoholic liver disease was accounting for 13% of liver transplants in the United States while non-alcoholic liver disease was 9%. In the last year for which we have data (2019), alcoholic liver disease is up to 29% while NAFLD is up to 22%. Peter says it will be very interesting to note how these data change post COVID… “I would bet that alcoholic liver disease would’ve risen disproportionately to NAFLD in the presence of COVID.”",

  "content": "Primary conditions that lead to fatalities are: alcohol, speeding, and distraction leading to a loss of control or contact with another vehicle. In the cases where drivers are killed on freeways… 31% of them have alcohol in their system and nearly 85% of these drivers were over the legal limit of 0.08 g/dL. But also think about the negative effects alcohol has on sleep quality, which could also increase the probability of driver error. When you understand how much poor sleep contributes to drowsy driving, which contributes to accidents, how much of that poor sleep could be underpinned by alcohol? “I don’t think we’ll ever know that, but it would suggest to me that this number of 31% and 85%, or 31% rather represents the floor to what this looks like.”",
