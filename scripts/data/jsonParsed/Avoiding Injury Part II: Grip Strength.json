  "content": "Grip strength is one of the strongest physical associations with longer life. It serves as a great proxy for overall body strength and muscle mass, as gripping involves not only the muscles of the hand but also those of the arms and shoulder. Grip strength is a very functional form of strength – given our reliance on our hands for countless everyday tasks, having a strong grip has an outsized impact on our quality of life. If your grip is weak, everything upstream of that is weak, which can often lead to injury.",

  "content": "Grip strength can directly make the difference between a good and a bad outcome in accidents. Having a strong grip gives you a greater chance of catching yourself after losing balance, thus avoiding the downward spiral in health that often follows a bad fall. Grip strength complements eccentric strength: while eccentric strength improves stability and deceleration and makes us less likely to lose our balance, grip strength provides a back-up level of protection for those inevitable occasions when we do stumble. The better we are at gripping supports, the less likely that a lapse in balance will result in a full-fledged fall and serious injury.",
