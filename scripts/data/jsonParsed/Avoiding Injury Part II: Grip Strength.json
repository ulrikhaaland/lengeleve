  "content": "Grip strength is important as it is one of the strongest physical associations with longer life. It serves as a great proxy for overall body strength and muscle mass, as gripping involves not only the muscles of the hand but also those of the arms and shoulder. Grip strength is a very functional form of strength, given our reliance on our hands for countless everyday tasks, and has an outsized impact on our quality of life.",

  "content": "Grip strength can directly make the difference between a good and a bad outcome in accidents. Having a strong grip gives you a greater chance of catching yourself after losing balance, thus avoiding the downward spiral in health that often follows a bad fall. The better we are at gripping supports, the less likely that a lapse in balance will result in a full-fledged fall and serious injury.",
