But my recollection is that the brain doesn’t require insulin the way the rest of the body does to facilitate glucose transport into neurons. Insulin resistance should not be an issue in the brain. But he has seen experimental data that look at intranasal insulin injections, and they temporarily alleviate some of the symptoms associated with this type of dementia. This suggests, paradoxically, that maybe insulin resistance is playing a role. Thinking about high cholesterol, patients with high ApoB often have a reduced speed of processing.

There are a lot of different factors that could influence something like executive function and speed of processing. What’s most helpful is looking at the individual. Putting their lab values and an understanding of what their risk factors are next to each other. For example, if you see somebody who has out of control cholesterol, and you’re looking at their executive function in tasks like generating words that start with F or A or S, (that’s a really popular test) that gives us clues into the question‒ “Is the vascular risk factor affecting this person’s cognition?” The chance that intervening on their cholesterol will have a notable outcome in the next 6, 12, 18 months is pretty high. But it depends on the person, and it also depends on what other factors are playing a role. For example, sleep is huge, “I can’t emphasize enough how important sleep is to speed of processing. If you are getting crap sleep, you really aren’t going to see a high speed of processing.” You really have to be sleeping in order to process information.",

What happens is that an enzyme (glucocerebrosidase) gets stuck in the endoplasmic reticulum and it can’t break down glucocerebroside. You’re not getting these chemicals broken down where they should be. They start building up, and when they start building up, the lysosome can’t get to these substances to break them down appropriately. The lysosomal function is really impaired. And once you start impairing the lysosomal function, then the mitochondria becomes affected, then you start triggering a whole slew of inflammatory cytokines. The process is a vicious cycle.",

Inflammatory bowel disease is also protective against Parkinson’s.

The PET scanner does not provide an anatomic image like a MRI or a CT scan. It provides a functional image; it just looks for glucose uptake. Hypometabolism shows up as less signal in an area of the brain. This means there is less metabolic activity there. Less glucose when to this part of the brain versus another part of the brain. And less glucose correlates to neurodegeneration in that part of the brain, or at least eventual neurodegeneration in that part of the brain.
