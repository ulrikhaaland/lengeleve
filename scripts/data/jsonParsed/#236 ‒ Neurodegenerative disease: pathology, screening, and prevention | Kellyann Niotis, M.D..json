  "content": "Neurodegeneration refers to the death of brain cells and encompasses various diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia, and Parkinson’s disease. Different diseases affect different parts of the brain. For instance, Alzheimer’s disease mainly affects the temporal lobe, leading to memory and language problems. Lewy body dementia affects the parietal and occipital lobe, leading to issues with visual spatial processing. Neurodegeneration is the third leading cause of death, following atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and cancer.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Preventing neurodegenerative diseases involves understanding the role of sensory input in reinforcing neuronal circuitry. Lack of proper sensory input can lead to atrophy of neuronal circuits. For instance, visual impairment is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. It is suggested that visual processing is needed to reinforce the neuronal circuitry. Therefore, maintaining good sensory health can help prevent these diseases.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Vascular dementia overlaps more with Alzheimer’s dementia and they are difficult to discern clinically. Vascular dementia is associated with speed of processing issues while Alzheimer’s disease is more of a memory issue. The frontal lobe is hypometabolic in terms of glucose utilization in both frontotemporal dementia and vascular dementia. This may be related to the vasculature of the brain and what areas of the brain are more sensitive to glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, and vascular risk factors.",

  "content": "Health factors such as high cholesterol and poor sleep can impact neurodegeneration. Patients with high ApoB often have a reduced speed of processing. Correcting health factors like ApoB can lead to improvement in the speed of processing. Sleep is also crucial to speed of processing. Without good sleep, information processing can be impaired.",

  "content": "Parkinson’s disease and ALS are different types of neurodegenerative diseases. ALS is a peripheral nerve problem and is quite rare, affecting only about 18,000 people in the US. Parkinson’s disease is a central problem and is more common, affecting a million people in the US. The incidence of Parkinson’s disease has doubled in the last 25 years, making it the fastest growing neurological condition.",

Mutation in C9ORF is a genetic risk factor that puts people at risk for both ALS and frontotemporal dementia. Some family members will have the frontotemporal dementia and other family members will have ALS. We don’t know what causes one person to develop the more peripheral nerve problem versus the more central nerve problem.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease relies on clinical symptoms‒ resting tremor, bradykinesia, which is slow movements, rigidity, which is stiffness of the muscles and or postural instability, so falling, not being steady on your feet. Early signs of disease are starting way before those symptoms are actually presenting. If you look at people who have REM sleep behavior disorder, which is acting out your dreams, punching, kicking, screaming in your sleep, this has over 90% positive predictive value that you will go on to develop either a Parkinson’s or Lewy body-like disease. And that starts 20 to 30 years before a tremor or muscle stiffness or postural instability will ever present.",

Both of these genes are tested in 23andMe, but only 1 variant of each so it’s not a perfect test.",

Were they drinking well water or city water? A movement assessment is absolutely key. We see abnormal movement patterns in these patients years and years before tremor, slow movements start. And the patterns that we see are very similar among people.",
