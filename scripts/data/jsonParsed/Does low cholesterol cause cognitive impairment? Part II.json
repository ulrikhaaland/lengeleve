  "content": "Last week I discussed the theoretical possibility that lipid-lowering drugs might negatively impact cognitive function, specifically, whether PCSK9 inhibitors had such an impact. The answer appears to be no, at least according to studies addressing this question. While PCSK9 inhibitors are the most potent drugs to lower apoB and LDL-C, they are not the most common—a distinction that belongs to a class of drugs you are no doubt familiar with: statins. Is it possible that statins may alter brain cholesterol synthesis in a way that is unique to their mechanism of action (and distinct from all other pharmacological mechanisms that lower cholesterol)?",

  "content": "Based on their mechanism of action, one of the biggest concerns with potent statin use is that it may increase the risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, or hemorrhagic strokes. Fortunately, after decades of research and billions of patient-years of use data, it doesn’t appear that people taking statins are at greater risk of these conditions. In fact, population studies actually suggest that statin use is associated with a reduced incidence of dementia, but observational studies like these are incapable of determining a cause-and-effect relationship.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Cholesterol is critical to normal brain function, but it’s unlikely that plasma cholesterol affects cognition because there’s no relationship between plasma cholesterol and tissue pools of cholesterol. However, it’s still possible that cholesterol levels in the brain can affect cognition, and because some statins have a variable ability to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and reduce cholesterol synthesis potentially lowering brain cholesterol below the level required for normal cognitive functioning.",

  "title": "Desmosterol as a Biomarker of Cholesterol Synthesis",
  "date": "September 26, 2021",
  "context": "Cholesterol",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There are two pathways for cholesterol to be synthesized within each cell in your body. One is called the Kandutsch-Russell pathway, which is believed to be the predominant pathway, where lathosterol is the penultimate sterol. The other is called the Bloch pathway, which is thought to be by some a less prominent path, where desmosterol is the penultimate sterol. Since cholesterol is ubiquitous, and highly recycled, a clever way to measure cholesterol synthesis is to measure direct levels of lathosterol and desmosterol. There is some evidence that the Bloch pathway is the predominant pathway in the brain, especially during infancy and childhood. This raises the hypothesis that desmosterol, specifically, may serve as a biomarker of cholesterol synthesis in the brain.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "It turns out that the brain tissue in AD patients are depleted in desmosterol and that desmosterol levels are relatively low in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to individuals without AD. A 2012 study was the first to report decreased plasma desmosterol levels in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is the stage between the expected cognitive decline associated with aging and the more severe decline of dementia. The investigators in this study measured cholesterol and desmosterol in both the plasma and CSF in Caucasian patients and looked at the relationship between the two locations. Their analysis revealed that the desmosterol-to-cholesterol ratio in the CSF correlated well with its plasma ratio, suggesting that plasma levels of desmosterol reflect brain sterol synthesis and metabolism.",

  "title": "Statin Therapy and Desmosterol Levels",

  "context": "Cholesterol",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "One of the most common causes of reduced desmosterol is statin therapy. Statins can cross the BBB — and while the data is conflicting — a recent study confirmed the hypothesis that lipophilic versions including simvastatin (Zocor) and atorvastatin (Lipitor) may more easily cross the BBB than hydrophilic ones including rosuvastatin (Crestor) and pravastatin (Pravachol), and therefore may inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the brain. Is low desmosterol a cause of cognitive impairment and dementia or the result of it? The short answer is we don’t know. What we do know is that cholesterol is critical to brain function and there are observational studies like the ones above (and more recent ones) suggesting low plasma desmosterol is a biomarker for MCI and AD.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Low desmosterol levels in patients with cognitive symptoms may serve as an indication that cholesterol synthesis is over-suppressed and the statin dose should be decreased (or stopped altogether in favor of a different drug class). Absolute concentrations of desmosterol below 0.8 mg/L in patients may be a cause for concern. Patients with one or two copies of the APOE e4 alleles or a family history of dementia should have a desmosterol level greater than 1.0 mg/L. While it is not certain whether low desmosterol from statin use increases the risk of dementia, a personalized approach may be necessary.",
