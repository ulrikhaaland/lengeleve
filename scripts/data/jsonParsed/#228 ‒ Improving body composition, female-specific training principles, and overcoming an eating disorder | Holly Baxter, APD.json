She was also struggling a lot with depression. At age 16 she had already attempted suicide twice. She was hospitalized for a good part of grade 11. This escalated into adulthood and only very recently has she started to work on her mental health. A lot of her advances have come as she has developed a sense of purpose in life and ultimately finding happiness.",
