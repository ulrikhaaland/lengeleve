Secret eating was really something that she struggled with. She would go out for dinner with friends and try to enjoy herself and partake in the food. But because she would restrict so aggressively, anytime she went outside of her 4 walls of comfort foods and things on her list of okay to eat, she was terrified. She had no control to slow down her eating. She ate extremely fast. It was absolutely spiraled out of control…. The only way I knew how to manage stress was to eat.

When she first started lifting, the weight was so low, she never challenged herself. She is grateful for the time she spent powerlifting because that style of training threw her into understanding training intensity and what her true strength was.

To optimize hypertrophy you need to take in anywhere from 1.8 g protein/ kg lean body mass to 3 g/kg.
