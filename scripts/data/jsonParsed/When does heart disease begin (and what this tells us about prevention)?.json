  "content": "Heart disease kills more Americans than any other disease. A woman in the United States is 7 to 8 times more likely to die from heart disease than she is from breast cancer. Atherosclerosis is caused by an inflammatory response to sterols in artery walls. Sterol delivery is lipoprotein-mediated, and therefore much better predicted by the number of lipoprotein particles (LDL-P) than by the cholesterol they carry (LDL-C). Atherosclerosis development begins with plaque accumulation in the vessel wall, which is accompanied by expansion of the outer vessel wall without a change in the size of the lumen. Only in advanced disease, and after significant plaque accumulation, does the lumen narrow.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Most people, doctors included, think atherosclerosis is a luminal-narrowing condition—a so-called “pipe narrowing” condition. It’s true that eventually the lumen of a diseased vessel does narrow, but this is sort of like saying the defining feature of a subprime collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is the inevitable default on its underlying assets. By the time that happens, eleven other pathologic things have already happened and you’ve missed the opportunity for the most impactful intervention to prevent the cascade of events from occurring at all.",

  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Low density lipoprotein (“LDL”) is a lipid (the bulk of which is cholesterol) transport particle. LDL—the particle—allows lipids (cholesterol, but also triglyceride, phospholipid) to be delivered through the aqueous medium of the blood, since lipids are hydrophobic (i.e., repel water) and a “carrier” is needed to transport them in blood (which is mostly water). When LDL particle concentration is elevated, the lipoprotein penetrates into the subendothelial space. Once in the intimal layer, they are securely attached to intimal proteoglycan molecules. The first step in atherogenesis is surface phospholipid (PL) exposure to reactive oxygen species and oxidation of the PL. LDL particles that are not oxidized are not atherogenic.",

  "content": "Oxidized LDL particles are toxic to the endothelium. Now-dysfunctional endothelial cells express selectins and vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAMS) which mark the injured areas of the vascular wall. The endothelial cells also express messenger cytokines such as interlukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) which circulate to the liver and induce the production of C-reactive protein (CRP). Monocytes penetrate the subendothelial space and when they do, the monocytes differentiate into (i.e., “become”) macrophages (a more specific type of immune cell). Macrophages phagocytize (basically “ingest”) the modified or oxidized LDL particles.",

  "content": "The phagocytosis of oxidized LDL particles (oxLDL) and accumulation of lipid in the macrophage creates something called a foam cell. Multiple foam cells coalesce to form the characteristic fatty streak, the hallmark of an early atherosclerotic plaque. Nascent Apo A-I containing particles (also known as prebeta-HDL particles) accumulate free or unesterified cholesterol from the macrophages using ATP Binding Cassette Transporters A1. As the HDL particle lipidates itself by delipidating the macrophage (i.e., takes lipid out of the foam cell), the HDL particle, utilizing an enzyme called LCAT, esterifies the free cholesterol forming cholesteryl ester (CE).",

  "content": "The value in HDL particles (the so-called “good cholesterol”) is almost assuredly in its functional capacity—what it is doing that might be cardioprotective (very hard to measure) rather than its cholesterol content (HDL-C), which is relatively easy to measure, but probably offers zero insight other than its positive epidemiological associations. In other words, measuring HDL cholesterol content tells you little about its cholesterol efflux capacity or any other of the numerous HDL functional properties.",
