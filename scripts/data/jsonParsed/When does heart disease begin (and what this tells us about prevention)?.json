Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is a lipid transport particle. When LDL particles are present in physiologic concentrations, they effectively deliver cholesterol to those tissues that require it. When LDL particle concentration is elevated, the lipoprotein penetrates into the subendothelial space. Once retained in the subendothelial space, the LDL particle may be modified, or oxidized.",

Furthermore, the only probabilities that matter when it comes to an individual are “0” and “1”–in other words we go from the most heterogeneous to the most homogeneous.",

While I do not doubt that some people with high LDL-P and Lp(a)-P may be immune to the typical “rules” of atherosclerosis, we don’t have good enough tools to predict this, especially non-invasively.
