  "content": "Cholesterol is an essential organic molecule in our body. We eat it, we make it, we store it, and we excrete it. Cholesterol exists in 2 forms – unesterified or 'free' and esterified. Much of the cholesterol we eat is not absorbed and is excreted by our gut. The cholesterol we synthesize in our body is the dominant source of the cholesterol in our body. The process of regulating cholesterol is very complex and multifaceted. Eating cholesterol has very little impact on the cholesterol levels in your body.",

  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Cholesterol and triglycerides are not soluble in plasma and are therefore said to be hydrophobic. To be carried anywhere in our body, they need to be carried by a special protein-wrapped transport vessel called a lipoprotein. As these lipoproteins leave the liver they undergo a process of maturation where they shed much of their triglyceride 'cargo' in the form of free fatty acid, making them smaller and richer in cholesterol. Special proteins, apoproteins, play an important role in moving lipoproteins around the body and facilitating their interactions with other cells.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The measurement of cholesterol has undergone a dramatic evolution over the past 70 years with technology at the heart of the advance. Currently, most people undergo a 'standard' lipid panel, which only directly measures total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol is measured or most often estimated. More advanced cholesterol measuring tests do exist to directly measure LDL cholesterol, along with the cholesterol content of other lipoproteins or lipoprotein subparticles.",

  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The progression from a completely normal artery to a 'clogged' or atherosclerotic one follows a very clear path: an apoB containing particle gets past the endothelial layer into the subendothelial space, the particle and its cholesterol content is retained, immune cells arrive, an inflammatory response ensues 'fixing' the apoB containing particles in place and making more space for more of them. The most common apoB containing lipoprotein in this process is the LDL particle. If you want to stop atherosclerosis, you must lower the LDL particle number.",

  "date": "May 23, 2012",
  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There are debates in lipidology about whether the size of an LDL particle matters. Some studies suggest that smaller LDL particles carry a much greater risk. However, other research indicates that the number of LDL particles is the best and only significant predictor of ischemic heart disease risk. The size of the LDL particles did not contribute to the risk of ischemic heart disease after considering the contribution of the number of LDL particles.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A continuous variable is something like height or weight, where the possible values are infinite between a range. This is contrasted with discrete variables like “tall” or “short,” where there are only two categories. LDL size is a continuous variable, meaning it can take on any value, not just “large” or “small.” When LDL size is used as the continuous variable it is, the influence of size goes away and only apoB (i.e., LDL-P) matters.",

This study used statistical analysis to parse out the real role of LDL-P versus particle size.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "When LDL-P is NOT taken into account, an increase of one standard deviation in particle size is associated with less atherosclerosis. However, when the authors adjusted for the number of LDL particles, the same phenomenon was not observed. Once you account for LDL-P, the relationship of atherosclerosis to particle size is abolished. Increased numbers of large LDL particles significantly increase risk.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A small LDL particle is no more atherogenic than a large one, but only by removing confounding factors is this clear. The small size of their particles is probably a marker for something else (e.g., metabolic derangement due to higher trafficking of triglycerides within LDL particles); Unless you know their particle number (i.e., LDL-P or apoB), you actually don’t know their risk.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "At first glance it would seem that patients with smaller LDL particles are at greater risk for atherosclerosis than patients with large LDL particles. However, one must look at changes in cardiovascular events or direct markers of atherosclerosis (e.g., IMT) while holding LDL-P constant and then again holding LDL size constant. Only when you do this can you see that the relationship between size and event vanishes. The only thing that matters is the number of LDL particles – large, small, or mixed.",
