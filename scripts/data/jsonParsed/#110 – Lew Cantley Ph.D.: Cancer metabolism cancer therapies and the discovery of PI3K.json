There was a lot of membrane transport being regulated by insulin. However, the actual mechanism was unknown. Eventually, the insulin receptor was purified and it was discovered that insulin hits this transmembrane tyrosine kinase, and when the molecule of insulin hits it, inside the cell this kinase pathway kicks up, moving the GLUT4 transporter and bringing glucose into the cell.",

You just run it over column, after column, after column, and eventually you’ve got to a single band on a gel and you said that was your protein. Insulin receptor is, it gets cleaved but- It’s a single polypeptide that gets clipped, during processing, into two proteins, that are held together by disulfide bonds. So it’s, and then it, dimer of that composition. So that we knew, late 1970s, and EGF receptor, it’s all these other receptors, all look a lot like the insulin receptor, and they all had tyrosine kinase activity that was triggered by binding the growth factor insulin, IGF-1 receptor also very similar insulin receptor.

So now we’re left with this several years of, we have a tyrosine kinase which explains how all of these growth factors work, including insulin, and how c-Src works, but we can’t find anything other than auto-phosphorylation. How does that help?

In both cases- You have three carbons with an OH on it, and inositol has six carbons with an OH on all. So if you took two… Yeah, if you take the two rings and shoved them together, yeah… Glued them together, you would get inositol.

Physicists had no problem understanding what I just said. If you confine things to two dimensions, they can come together much more readily than if you do it in three dimensions.
