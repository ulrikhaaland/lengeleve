Next, Lew realized that insulin resistance, which creates the need for more insulin, could be helping cancer grow. Since the 1970s, Lew began to realize that if you add insulin to cancer cells in culture, it makes them grow better. Cancer cells tend to have more insulin receptors than the tissue from which they emerged. In the process of tumors growing, evolving, they turn up the expression of the insulin receptor and that allows them to respond to insulin better.",

The experiment design: To see if there was a higher risk for colorectal cancer with high sugar consumption (in mice). Lew’s hypothesis: High sugar consumption would eventually lead to insulin resistance (therefore high insulin) which may accelerate the growth of colorectal cancer. And indeed this turned out to be true. They wanted to see if sugar itself was directly feeding tumors (and not needing insulin). The fed the rats a high sugar diet but controlled for calories in order to NOT make them obese. They were consuming the equivalent of a 12 ounce cola sugary drink. Over 6 months, the mice did not gain wait or become insulin resistant. Yet, they still had increased polyp size by two to three fold in the colon. Turns out it needed to be a COMBINATION of both glucose and fructose (aka sucrose and/or HFCS). Neither glucose alone nor fructose alone could cause tumor growth. Lew also found that liquid sugar was way more potent than solid food with the same amount of sugar. The liquid nature of the sugar allowed the sugar to travel more quickly and the fructose (and some glucose) made it all the way to the colon to feed the tumors. Rats who were fed sugar water ad libitum actually were “protected” from insulin resistance because the polyps were eating so much of the sugar. You had to have fructose and glucose because the actual carbon atoms that were being used to grow the tumor were coming from the glucose and NOT from the fructose. What the fructose was doing… when it went into the polyp, it was converted to fructose-1-phosphate by an enzyme called ketohexokinase (aka fructokinase). The fructokinase enzyme is only found in three tissues in any significant concentration: the liver, the kidney, and the gut.",

They all had tyrosine kinase activity that was triggered by binding the growth factor insulin, IGF-1 receptor also very similar insulin receptor. One by one by one different labs purified them and they all found the same thing. You add the growth factor to the cell, and you get the tyrosine kinase activity activated on the inside of the cell.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In the early 1980s, a new tyrosine kinase activity was discovered that explained how growth factors work, including insulin and c-Src. This led to the observation that auto-phosphorylations were recruiting other proteins to the membrane that drove cell growth. Researchers were trying to figure out how many steps were needed to explain glucose uptake, amino acid uptake, and glycogen synthesis. A paper by Ray Erikson's laboratory found an activity associated with c-Src that phosphorylated glycerol, which looked like half of an inositol. They collaborated to see whether phosphatidylinositol might be a better substrate than glycerol and found a Km of like five micromolar.",

Other labs tried to reproduce his results but failed because they presented it in detergent instead of using a sonifier to make membrane lipids. Cantley was confident in his methodology and knew that his results were reproducible. He sent people to other labs with a sonifier to convince them to do the assay right. Cantley had no doubt that he was right and knew what he was doing made sense.",
