Humans are born with this ability. But we lose it over time because of our lack of activity and our abundance of sitting. But it’s possible to reacquire this ability through deliberate practice of these movements.

You might even be thinking of free radical production from “leakage” as your mitochondria become more efficient organelles in the context of training. And with Olympic lifting, which may seem like all about performance, a good coach should watching closely and correcting any efficient movement or “leakage”. So in a way like that speaks to DNS being the foundation for all forms of exercise. It originated from at Prague school as a tool upon which one could study the developmental delay in children with cerebral palsy. And it was through that that they realized that kids with CP had missed certain developmental milestones. The initial thrust of DNS was how can we go back and teach these kids early enough in life once they’re diagnosed to learn these movement patterns that they would otherwise miss and to save them some of the challenges later on. Be care about rushing kids through natural stages of neuromuscular development: It’s common for kids to have hip dysplasia being born breached and to then be put in a hip harness for 6+ months. This is a really a horrible thing for a kid to be in because it really limits movement during a very critical period of development. Be careful with bumbo seats that put them up in a seated position prematurely before they have developed the truncal strength to support themselves or the stability. You’re rushing through a stage and they tend to then not develop the right connections across their torso. Same goes with those bouncer walker things. Or even putting shoes on kids too early. “There’s a whole bunch of things that we do as parents obviously with the best of intentions that actually kind of work against a child’s correct neuromuscular development.”",
