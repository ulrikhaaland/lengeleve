What a typical diet, exercise, sleep, stress management, and supplementation looks like. What labs (e.g., glucose, ketones, lipids, inflammation and oxidation markers, thyroid, sex hormones) were checked for the experiment. The results after one week on a ketogenic diet. The results after a week on a water-only fast. The results after a week on a ketogenic diet following a week of fasting. The top 6 surprises from the fasting experiment. Different fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) protocols. What is the optimal protocol, frequency, and duration for fasting? How to break a fast without GI distress? Am I breaking the fast if…?",
