To develop a signature for autophagy: looking at small molecules, metabolites, proteomic changes, may provide more insight into a question that is currently unknown or not well understood: what is the optimal fasting protocol? Some amount of cycling nutrient exposure is probably the sweet spot. Some amount of feast and famine may be optimal. Daily intermittent fasting? Prolonged fasts at some intermittent frequency (e.g., a one-week fast per quarter)? There are almost an infinite number of variations. A tool to measure proxies of the benefits of these types of fast may help us elucidate what’s effective. Protocol may need to be customized (i.e., different tactics for the same strategy): would two people benefit equally or does a certain phenotype/genotype do better on a particular regimen?",

Small LDL (sLDL) went to 800 (<500 is optimal), a 45% increase from baseline (sLDL is also known as small dense LDL or sdLDL). Uric acid went up: Peter is maniacal because of uric acid’s effect on blood pressure and atherosclerosis (Some evidence that uric acid can crystallize inside of atherosclerotic plaque along with the sterol). Homocysteine was high. Free T3 (fT3) went down, T4 (thyroxine) went up (probably converting less T4 to T3 [triiodothyronine], and more to reverse T3 [rT3]). fT3/rT3 ratio tanked (56% decrease from baseline). Body wanting to slow the metabolism down, Peter assumes. Peter lost around 4 lbs from baseline: surprised to see the deterioration of thyroid function with a weight loss that small (and probably a nontrivial amount of the weight loss was water).
