It’s simply an empirical fact and anybody who’s tried a ketogenic diet, anybody who has treated patients with ketogenic diets will attest to that. One of the other things that’s missing in a ketogenic diet is sugar. Sugar, even in modest amounts, will boot you out of ketosis and it’s something probably about the elevation of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that makes the ketogenic diet work a little bit better.

An interesting study that just came out in 2022 that looked at using about 500 milligrams a day of cocoa flavonoids. Study last 3.5 years. Groups: 400 subjects taking supplement and 450 in the placebo group. Results: It did not find a significant reduction in total cardiovascular events though it did find a reduction in CVD deaths specifically. Peter says that he wouldn’t be surprised if this study was just underpowered so that the effect size that was significant was smaller than what they set out to test.

  "content": "Peter can really only speak to one called Athletic Greens (disclosure: he’s an investor in the company). He takes a scoop of Athletic Greens every day, regardless of what else he’s eating. He knows that if he’s taking that AG, he’s getting exactly what he needs (probably a little bit more). AG is an expensive product, but it’s expensive because it costs an unbelievable amount to make. And that’s part of the reason you have to refrigerate it after you open a packet. If you’re consuming a product that doesn’t need to be refrigerated once it’s been exposed to air, it’s probably not a very high quality.",

In part it’s because you’re not eating as many vegetables on hunting trips. Then, frankly, there’s just, I want to be at my absolute best, I suppose. So it’s worth the extra headache of trying to remember to take that second dose.",

  "content": "Understand that we don’t have really great data when it comes to nutrition on these macro questions that everybody understandably wants to have insights to. Therefore on some level you have to be somewhat empirical. You want to combine empiricism with the best of the available information that we have and try to not be terribly dogmatic about it. Otherwise you end up spending too much time thinking about this at the expense of thinking about things that are, in my opinion, more important.",
