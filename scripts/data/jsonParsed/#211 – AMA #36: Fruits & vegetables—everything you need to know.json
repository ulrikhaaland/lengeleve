Comes down to the role of glucose. In the absence of glucose, the amount of vitamin C that you need is very little to act as a co-factor, I think, that’s for Proline, the amino acid that’s necessary to maintain the integrity of the fibrous tissue that would prevent you from having scurvy. The Inuit we’re going to get that small amount of trace vitamin C from the blubber that they were actually eating or probably within the meat of the animal since it’s a water soluble vitamin. If you’re on a standard American diet, you actually do need vitamin C because you’ve got enough carbohydrate in your diet that you’re probably going to need a higher dose. We do need to make sure that we are somehow getting vitamin A, biotin, folate, vitamin C, vitamin D, E, calcium, magnesium potassium, etc. The question becomes, how do you get it?
