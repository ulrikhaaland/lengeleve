  "content": "A single meal, regardless of how large, does not generally have a long-term impact on body weight, fat mass, or important metabolic parameters. Though many notice an uptick in weight the morning after a heavy meal, such “overnight weight gain” is typically the result of water retention, as a larger-than-average meal usually corresponds to a larger-than-average quantity of sodium and carbohydrate.",

  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The tendency to continue overeating is in part due to a surplus in supply: leftovers from that delicious holiday feast crowd the refrigerator and constantly tempt us to have another taste (this time with no cooking required). Unfortunately, this problem is compounded in many individuals by a decreased sense of inhibition toward food following a single episode of overeating. In other words, one is more likely to overeat after consuming a large meal than after eating nothing at all.",

  "content": "A little advanced planning can go a long way toward ensuring that indulgence doesn’t get out of hand or become a habit. I find, for example, that changing my environment in such a way that removes temptation is more effective than hoping I’ll have the willpower to resist temptation as it arises. Willpower is, in my estimation, a lousy strategy. For me, removing post-meal temptation means preemptive leftover control. Whenever I host Thanksgiving dinner, I ask each of my guests to bring tupperware. No one leaves the house without their share, and I’m not left with a stuffed refrigerator. Another strategy is simply to prepare less food.",

  "content": "In previous years, I’ve also often relied on a pre-holiday fast to help me prepare for the onslaught of excess calories. This would typically involve maintaining my workout routine while drastically reducing my calorie intake in the 3-4 days leading up to Thanksgiving. By the time the Macy’s parade floats came sailing into Herald Square on Thursday morning, I had built up enough of a calorie deficit that I could safely chow down to my heart’s content. But this still doesn’t address the leftover problem, it only addresses the “damage” from the feast.",

A deviation from the game plan, but I could improvise: I tossed the leftover pie in the trash, and as I went to bed, I was feeling pretty good about overcoming the temptation of my foe. But after my morning workout the next day, the pie came roaring back with a vengeance. Before I knew it, I was digging through the trash, and sure enough, it was waiting there, still in its box, ready for me.",
