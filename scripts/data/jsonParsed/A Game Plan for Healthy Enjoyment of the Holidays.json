  "content": "A single meal, regardless of how large, does not generally have a long-term impact on body weight, fat mass, or important metabolic parameters. Though many notice an uptick in weight the morning after a heavy meal, such “overnight weight gain” is typically the result of water retention, as a larger-than-average meal usually corresponds to a larger-than-average quantity of sodium and carbohydrate. The apparent gain is short-lived and doesn’t reflect an increase in fat mass. It’s very easy to let a single oversized meal turn into a series of many oversized meals, and the excess calories quickly add up. In the days after a large meal, the tendency to continue overeating is in part due to a surplus in supply: leftovers from that delicious holiday feast crowd the refrigerator and constantly tempt us to have another taste.",

  "content": "This problem is compounded in many individuals by a decreased sense of inhibition toward food following a single episode of overeating. One is more likely to overeat after consuming a large meal than after eating nothing at all. This phenomenon – known as “counter-regulatory eating” – is, paradoxically, strongest among those who adhere to strict diets under normal circumstances. The strength of the counter-regulatory eating response does not correspond directly to the calorie content of the initial food. Rather, it appears to depend on the degree to which the dieter perceives a food as “forbidden,” irrespective of calorie load, implying that different individuals are likely to have different food triggers for this response.",

  "content": "A little advanced planning can go a long way toward ensuring that indulgence doesn’t get out of hand or become a habit. Changing the environment in such a way that removes temptation is more effective than hoping to have the willpower to resist temptation as it arises. Removing post-meal temptation means preemptive leftover control. Another strategy is simply to prepare less food. In previous years, maintaining a workout routine while drastically reducing calorie intake in the 3-4 days leading up to a large meal has been effective. However, this still doesn’t address the leftover problem, it only addresses the “damage” from the feast. Some might find, for example, that aggressive fasting only worsens counter-regulatory eating after the fast is broken. The most effective and realistic game plan will vary for different individuals and different families, and even the best-laid plans can sometimes fail in the short-term.",
