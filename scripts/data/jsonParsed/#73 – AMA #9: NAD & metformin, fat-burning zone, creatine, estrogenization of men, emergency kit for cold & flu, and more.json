  "content": "If you took blood samples from a group of men in the 1950s, and did the same for a similar group of men today, you would notice that, in today’s men, testosterone is lower, and their estrogen is higher. The reasons for this could be an increase in obesity, which implies more adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is where we’re going to see more of the enzyme called aromatase (which turns testosterone into estrogen). If you have more adipose tissue and potentially more aromatase, you will undergo that chemical reaction more of turning the testosterone into estrogen. Another reason could be chemicals that can mimic the effects of estrogen (or increase the production of estrogen). Lots of plastics have been proposed to do this.",

Being able to spot an axis deer, literally just see one, is ridiculously hard. Their sense of sight, hearing, and smell are preternatural (they can smell you from a hundred yards away). Stalking them is nearly impossible without expert guides. If you manage to find them, stalk them, get in position to shoot them, and accurately hit them, you then have to harvest them properly.",

Just like someone who needs to eat better, exercise more, sleep more… You can’t impose that on people. It’s the same when someone needs to “unscrew themselves emotionally”.

But you can’t wait until you’re in the middle of it or it’s too late. It only works if you catch the influenza right on the update. Peter points out that the flu vaccine isn’t efficacious every year (in 2018 it was “basically a placebo”). So you could still get the flu even if you get the shot. If Peter even starts getting a fever, he will assume its the flu and take the tamiflu. 2. Amantadine + Aleve - Amantadine is for treating the regular, garden variety, pain in the ass cold. The protocol is… Take the given dose of amantadine in combination with two Aleve a day, for five days. Start taking it the second you have the onset of symptoms. The Aleve is for SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) which is why you feel bad with a cold. SIRS is the body’s immune response to: The toxins that are being released by the virus, and more importantly, the immune cells themselves actually gearing up each other.",

Today, Peter says that some of the oral NAD precursors (NR, NMN) may actually have some efficacy. Metformin: Slightly more bearish on Metformin for longevity in otherwise “healthy” people. Today, Peter says he’s a “bit more tempered in my enthusiasm around metformin use in the healthiest of people”. He remains incredibly optimistic about the use of metformin in people who are metabolically anything other than very healthy. But when you take that tiny subset of people who are like 9 out of 10 in terms of health… “it’s possible metformin is not helping them, and it’s even possible that metformin is detracting a little bit.”",

  "content": "At 60% of your maximum heart rate… you may be burning your highest percentage of fat but you are absolutely not even coming close to burning your highest amount of fat. Looking at percentage of fat oxidation can lead to ridiculous ideas such as “you burn more fat while sleeping and than while exercising”. Exercising at 60% of maximum heart rate is too low in intensity. This is considered being in “zone 1”. It’s not harmful in any way, shape, or form. It’s just not the best use of your time. Zone 2 is a better place to be. 75 to 80% of maximum heart rate. So with a max HR of 180, your zone 2 would be a HR of 135-144. This is the sweet spot to be spending your “cardio time”. You are right at the threshold of the mitochondria. Just being on the cusp of really crossing over into anaerobic work. The fitter you get, the higher that number gets.",
