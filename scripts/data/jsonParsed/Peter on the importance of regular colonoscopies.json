  "content": "Peter has an increased aggression when it comes to screening for gastrointestinal cancers. In 2020, there were about 600,000 people in the US that died of cancer, and 170,000 of the 600,000 were in the GI system. Some of those GI cancers are very difficult to screen for, such as pancreatic cancer, for which we don’t really have a great way to screen for it. But the good news is that there are a lot of cancers for which we can directly take a look at the epithelial surface that is going to become cancerous. And there is no part of that that is more important than the colon. The esophagus, the stomach, and the colon probably represent about 40% of those GI cancers. Liver and intrahepatic, bile duct, and pancreas are probably also about 40%, and those are much harder to screen for. But when you look at organ-specific sites, colon cancer is generally in the top three leading causes of death for both men and women. Bold and controversial opinion from Peter: “Nobody should ever die from colon cancer.” (same for esophageal and stomach).",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The progression from non-cancer to cancer is visible to the naked eye, through the transition of nonmalignant polyp to malignant polyp. If you did a colonoscopy on somebody every single day of their life, they would never get colon cancer because, at some point, you would see the polyp, you would remove it while it is non-cancerous, and they would not get cancer. There’s no clear answer to the question of what is the shortest interval of time for which a person can have a completely normal colonoscopy until they can have a cancer. Some case reports suggest that it can happen in as little as six to eight months. Most people would agree that if you had a colonoscopy every one to two years, the likelihood that you could ever develop a colon cancer, while maybe not zero, is so remote that you could effectively take colon cancer off the list of the top 10 reasons why someone dies of cancer. Peter says: “It’s for that reason that I’m very aggressive when it comes to this type of screening, which also includes upper endoscopy…you basically get for free the esophagus and stomach when you look at the entire colon, rectum, anus.”",
