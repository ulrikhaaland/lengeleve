  "content": "Aggressive screening for gastrointestinal cancers could save lives. In 2020, about 600,000 people in the US died of cancer, 170,000 of which were in the GI system. Some of these GI cancers are difficult to screen for, like pancreatic cancer, for which diffusion-weighted image MRIs and liquid biopsies are used. However, there are many cancers that can be directly observed at the epithelial surface that is going to become cancerous. The esophagus, stomach, and colon represent about 40% of these GI cancers. Colon cancer is generally in the top three leading causes of death for both men and women.",

  "content": "The progression from non-cancer to cancer is visible to the naked eye, through the transition of nonmalignant polyp to malignant polyp. If you did a colonoscopy on somebody every single day of their life, they would never get colon cancer because, at some point, you would see the polyp, you would remove it while it is non-cancerous, and they would not get cancer. Most people would agree that if you had a colonoscopy every one to two years, the likelihood that you could ever develop a colon cancer, while maybe not zero, is so remote that you could effectively take colon cancer off the list of the top 10 reasons why someone dies of cancer.",
