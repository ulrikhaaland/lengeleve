  "content": "Normal metabolism involves eating carbs which increases plasma glucose. This increase stimulates insulin secretion which in turn stimulates glucose uptake in muscle and suppresses GNG by the liver. In a healthy individual, 80-90% of consumed glucose is stored as glycogen in muscle and liver. The muscle is the predominant place where we dispose of glucose. When referring to 'glucose disposal', it means muscle taking in glucose.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Insulin resistance is a continuum, with one end being just becoming insulin resistant and the other end being full-blown type 2 diabetes. The first sign of this is normal levels of glucose going in but at a higher level of insulin. The first thing that usually shows up is higher levels of plasma glucose because the liver is becoming resistant to insulin. The liver being resistant to insulin means it’s not slowing down glucose production, and therefore in the presence of glucose it’s still making glucose. At some point there’s not even enough insulin that the pancreas can make to overcome the resistance resulting in a person needing medication.",

  "content": "Three fates of glucose within the muscle are oxidative, glycolytic, and glycogen. The oxidative fate of glucose says glucose comes into a muscle and immediately gets converted into ATP through the very efficient pathway. The second potential fate of glucose is to undergo glycolysis. The third fate of glucose in the muscle is it can be stored as glycogen. When things go wrong, at least one of those three are not working.",
