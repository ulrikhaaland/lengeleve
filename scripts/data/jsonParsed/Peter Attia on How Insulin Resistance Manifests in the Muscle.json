It also explains how glucose disposal works in a healthy individual and how insulin secretion stimulates glucose uptake in muscle and suppresses GNG by the liver.",

  "content": "This section explains what happens when things go wrong in the process of glucose disposal. It explains that the first thing that goes wrong is the muscles take in less glucose, and by extension, the plasma insulin level has to rise to force that in. It also explains that the liver being resistant to insulin means it’s not slowing down glucose production, and therefore in the presence of glucose it’s still making glucose. At some point, there’s not even enough insulin that the pancreas can make to overcome the resistance resulting in a person needing medication to start to overcome this problem.",
