  "content": "A recent 3.6-year study by Sesso et al. evaluated the effects of cocoa extracts on ASCVD. The 21,442-participant randomized control trial (RCT) evaluated the effects of cocoa extracts on ASCVD. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either cocoa flavanols (500 mg per day) or placebo. The investigators evaluated the total number of cardiac events, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, cardiovascular (CV) mortality, and carotid artery surgery. The group taking cocoa supplements had a 27% relative risk reduction in ASCVD deaths compared to the placebo group.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Small RCTs have found that flavanol-rich cocoa can lower blood pressure, inhibit platelet activation, and improve endothelial function. For instance, one small pilot study of five healthy men showed that consumption of 450 mg of cocoa flavanols resulted in an average 2.5 mmHg decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure two hours after flavanol consumption. It also showed a consistent reduction in blood pressure over the course of the entire month: an average of 4 mmHg reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, comparable to the effect size typically observed with blood pressure medications.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The cocoa supplements used in these studies are more concentrated in polyphenols than the everyday chocolate bars we might buy in a store. So how much dark chocolate is equivalent to the cocoa supplements used in this study? The supplements contained 500 mg flavanols per day, with 80 mg (-)-epicatechin. Dark chocolate is estimated to have about 23.4% nonfat cocoa solids. A one-ounce serving of dark chocolate, or about 30 g, is estimated to contain about 57 mg of flavanols and 10 mg  (-)-epicatechin – eight to ten-fold less than supplements.",

Cocoavia supplements used in this study were provided by the manufacturer Mars Edge, which, notably, also funded this research, though the company was not directly involved in the trial design or data collection.",
