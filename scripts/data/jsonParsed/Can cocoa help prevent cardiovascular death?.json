  "content": "Cocoa comes from plants, and contains bioactive compounds called polyphenols which may have various beneficial effects on human health. The cocoa bean is high in a subclass of these compounds called flavanols, and in particular the flavanol (-)-epicatechin, which has been shown to increase levels of circulating nitric oxide – a key factor in maintaining vascular endothelial health. Nearly 875,000 deaths each year are attributed to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), so it is possible that cocoa could help delay the onset of ASCVD.",

  "title": "Cocoa Supplementation and ASCVD",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A recent 3.6-year study sought to explore the idea of cocoa supplementation having a clinically-relevant effect on ASCVD. The randomized control trial evaluated the effects of cocoa extracts on ASCVD. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either cocoa flavanols (500 mg per day) or placebo. The group taking cocoa supplements had a 27% relative risk reduction in ASCVD deaths compared to the placebo group.",

  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Small RCTs have found that flavanol-rich cocoa can lower blood pressure, inhibit platelet activation, and improve endothelial function. There appear to be both acute effects within hours of consumption as well as longer-term effects over the course of months. One small pilot study showed that consumption of 450 mg of cocoa flavanols resulted in an average 2.5 mmHg decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure two hours after flavanol consumption.",

  "date": "June 25, 2022",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The cocoa supplements used in these studies are more concentrated in polyphenols than the everyday chocolate bars. So how much dark chocolate is equivalent to the cocoa supplements used in this study? The supplements contained 500 mg flavanols per day, with 80 mg (-)-epicatechin. A one-ounce serving of dark chocolate, or about 30 g, is estimated to contain about 57 mg of flavanols and 10 mg  (-)-epicatechin – eight to ten-fold less than supplements.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "One of the largest modifying effects in the longer term study related to smoking history: while ever-smokers taking cocoa supplements were at significantly lower risk of CV events relative to those taking placebo, cocoa supplements did not appear to confer any CV benefit relative to placebo among never-smokers. Smoking is known to impair endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, a process that needs nitric oxide. While smoking inhibits nitric oxide synthase (the enzyme that makes nitric oxide) and increases its degradation, the cocoa flavanol (-)-epicatechin has been shown to increase circulating nitric oxide levels.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "It’s always important to keep in mind any potential commercial motivations behind these studies, especially since taking these daily supplements will cost upwards of $45/ month, and requires long-term commitment. The improved hazard rates for ASCVD death didn’t begin until one year after starting supplements. Despite skepticism over the research motivations, there appears to be no harm (other than accumulated monetary cost) in supplementing with cocoa extracts, as the worst side effects of supplements were nausea.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Supplementing with cocoa flavanols isn’t likely to change the possibility of having an ASCVD event, but it may reduce event severity, leading to better outcomes and fewer ASCVD deaths. While this benefit may be very small relative to other strategies like aerobic exercise, every advantage helps, and these data certainly merit consideration.",
