  "content": "In this episode, Peter sits down with Drs. Marty Makary and Zubin Damania (aka ZDoggMD), both previous guests on The Drive. This episode, recorded on December 27, 2021, was in part inspired by some of the shoddy science and even worse messaging coming from top officials regarding COVID-19. In this discussion, Marty and ZDoggMD discuss what is known about the omicron variant, the risks and benefits of vaccines for all age groups, and the taboo subject of natural immunity and the protection it offers against infection and severe disease. Furthermore, they discuss at length the poor messaging coming from our public officials, the justification (and lack thereof) for certain mandates and policies in light of the current evidence, and the problems caused by the highly politicized and polarized nature of the subject. Themes throughout the conversation include the difference between science and advocacy, the messaging which is sowing mistrust in science despite major progress, and a search for what a possible “end” to this situation might look like.",

On the one hand, people think this is a pharma conspiracy to make more money; the only thing that works is ivermectin. The other group is everyone needs to have a booster every Monday and we never want to see the world as it was in 2019 again until this virus goes the way of smallpox, a zero COVID policy world. How many people are not in one of these 2 groups?",

  "content": "Peter notes the type of person who he doesn’t believe is one who says the same exact thing over and over, that doesn’t feel differently about this now versus 6 months ago or 18 months ago. School closures last year are a good example, he doesn’t believe anyone who doesn’t think we got that wrong. Something ZDoggMD points out when he talks about the alt middle is, “you should be able to question every single one of your beliefs because there’s really, you know, if you’re sticking to one single view there, you’re probably missing something”. It gives credibility when someone says they were wrong about something for these reasons, and this is how their thinking has changed. A hedge fund manager who is never willing to change their point of view in the presence of new information is going to end up losing money. It helps to be malleable based on the available data. In medicine the reward is uncoupled from the outcome and this creates mass confusion. It’s difficult to sort out the really good critical thinkers. ZDoggMD agrees that people would benefit from  having the endpoint sync with their thinking. It’s hard to know what the outcomes are for improving healthcare; what is the endpoint?",
