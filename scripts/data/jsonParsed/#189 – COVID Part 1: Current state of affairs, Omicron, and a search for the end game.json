Epidemiological data from South Africa suggest Omicron causes a more mild illness. The observation of a milder clinical syndrome is complicated by the high seroprevalence in South Africa (from previous infection). There is some natural immunity and vaccine immunity in this population. This is a more immune population and this has to be taken into consideration with the observation that this virus is a little more replicable and maybe a little less pathogenic.",

In medicine the reward is uncoupled from the outcome and this creates mass confusion. It’s difficult to sort out the really good critical thinkers.
