As a kid growing up, he was not considered fast, but he learned that speed is a skill that can be learned. Along with speed training, their philosophy equally emphasizes injury prevention. Every athlete is given an in-depth biomechanic movement analysis, movement screen, and past injury review before designing their unique training program.",

At the time I was struggling in my own personal training after making the switch to a higher fat, low carb, no sugar lifestyle and it made a big difference for me personally.",

I became accustomed to either having an upset stomach while I was training or, to avoid a stomachache, I wouldn’t eat and would bonk in workouts. It was a constant struggle to figure out the right combination of certain foods or supplements and timing my digestion to optimize my own performance.  I never quite figured it out, until I found Super Starch. I take it about a hour prior to my workouts and it doesn’t upset my stomach, it gives me steady energy, and I get a carbohydrate source that allows me to keep burning fat stores.",
