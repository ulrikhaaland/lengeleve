  "content": "Sleep disruption could be a biomarker of dementia, or even an underlying cause. Sleep may be one of the most significant lifestyle factors that determines your risk ratio for Alzheimer's disease. Poor sleep could lead to neuronal energy deprivation. Insufficient sleep increases oxidative stress leading to a cascade of events that lead to neuronal death. The hippocampus, which is involved in memory, is the first area damaged in Alzheimer's. During deep sleep, the brain's 'sewage' system, the glymphatic system, kicks in and washes out 'metabolic detritus' of wakefulness. One of the things washed away is β-amyloid, a core protein in Alzheimer's formation which escalates Alzheimer's risk.",

In the future, there may be at least 5 subtypes of Alzheimer’s. Data suggests that tau accumulation, a factor in Alzheimer's, can result from sleep insufficiency. The strong predictive link between insufficient sleep and Alzheimer's disease suggests that different sleep features will be predictive of different aspects of the amyloid pathology cascade. Poor sleep has many negative health effects that could feed into Alzheimer's disease, making it difficult to tease out mechanistic links.",

If you're getting less sleep at almost any point in the lifespan, the risk that you're going to have higher amounts of these Alzheimer's disease proteins in your brain is greater.",
