Instead, they acquire R&D products — this opens up opportunity for smaller companies with venture capital money investing in stage one risk. Pharma comes in and brings the huge capital allocation required for late stage two/three that is closer to drug approval. This opens up opportunity for pharma to reposition the “7+3” drug and charge 10x more for it. Instead, you get a situation where Keytruda is costing an arm and a leg and only extending life by a few months — but the pharma company is making big money on it.",
