However, we are finding that for the vast majority of cancers, it is random mutations that account for them—which means that cancer is most commonly associated with increasing age. With age, many more of the cells in our body have undergone several divisions, and with each division we pick up some DNA copying errors. By the time the cells are 60 years of age, every cell has undergone multiple cycles of proliferation, therefore, multiple genetic mutations have collected. These mutations are making the cell unstable and susceptible to turning cancerous. Considering the complexity of treating existing cancers, we should instead shift our focus to prevention. Instead of spending 5% in prevention, we should spend 50% in prevention and early detection. We should instead employ all of the sophisticated technology and intellectual resources to developing biomarkers for early detection in humans.
