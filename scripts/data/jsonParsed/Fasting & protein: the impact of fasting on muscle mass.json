Peter is very reluctant to put an excess fasting routine in place for somebody that’s not very heavy. If you’re talking about somebody who’s got 35% body fat, insulin resistance, I think fasting’s a very effective tool and it’s okay that they’re going to probably lose a little bit of lean mass, because they’re probably going to lose more fat mass along the way. If you’re talking about somebody who’s kind of lanky, Peter would lean towards not fasting so much and if you’re going to fast do it intermittently — e.g., maybe once a quarter you do a short fast for three days. But most of the time should be really focused on building.",

  "content": "The problem with one meal a day for most people, if they’re trying to put on muscle mass, it’s pretty darn hard to eat two grams per kilo of protein in one sitting. OMADs and things like that are generally going to come at the expense of muscle mass—Not because muscle protein synthesis can’t take place if you’re smart about where you target and time your exercise, but because I simply think most people are protein deficient when they do it. It becomes a bit of a protein sparing diet. Again, OMAD is a great idea if you’re overweight and insulin resistant, not a great idea if you’re lean.",
