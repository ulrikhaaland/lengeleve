  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "As more people get vaccinated with either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, some people report that they experience the ensuing days in fever, headaches, and chills. The second injection reminds the adaptive immune system that a viral threat is still around. The factors that influence the immune response to vaccination depend on a large number of variables such as age, genetics, and comorbidities. If you don’t respond with body aches and pains after the first and/or second dose, the immune response is working all the same. From the published effectiveness reports, Moderna’s showed 94.1% effective and Pfizer’s showed 95% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID infection after two doses.",
