It’s a “double edged sword”. Benefits of napping may include improvement in learning and memory, cardiovascular function. Bad things about napping… Throughout the day you are building up the sleepiness chemical called adenosine. And after about 16 hours of wakefulness, you should have enough of this sleepiness chemical weighing down on you (i.e., sleep pressure) to force you into sleep at night. If you nap, you release some of that pressure which may make it harder for you to fall asleep at night. So the answer is if you can nap regularly and you’re not struggling with sleep at night, naps are just fine.

With a partial collapse, you’ll start to get this sort of strange sound. When it fully collapses, that’s when you will get cessation of breathing typically. 2 | Central sleep apnea. There is no blockage in the airway, there is no problem with the airway at all. In fact, it seems to be a fault of the brain itself. The brain for a short period of time stops sending the signal for respiration. Note: You can also have a mix of both obstructive and central apnea. Sleep apnea is the most underdiagnosed sleep disorder. About 80% of people who have it are undiagnosed. It kills you chronically but poor sleep contributing to disease and aging. And it kills you acutely. E.g., you might fall asleep behind the wheel of your car. Think you might have sleep apnea? Take the Stop-Bang Questionnaire. If you do, find yourself a board certified sleep medicine doctor at sleepeducation.org. Do not leave sleep apnea untreated, it will shorten your lifespan, and it will certainly shorten your health span. That data is compelling. CPAP device. Stands for continuous positive airway pressure. It attempts to force open the obstructed airway with pressure. It needs to be fitted to the individual and the pressure titrated to match the needs of the person. Adherence issues: How can we improve the compliance and adherence for these devices? First, we must get really good at fitting the mask properly because… i) an uncomfortable fit will reduce adherence ii) a bad fit will not keep the proper pressure needed to open the airway. Secondly, accountability from another person or technology. Having an app or having a coach that would actually just help you check in with you every day, just give you motivation. Do we know what causes central apnea? Not a lot of data so the etiology is less clear. We know a lot more about the contributing factors of obstructive apnea. Such as men are twice as likely to have it. Overweight. Neck circumference. What is the most common type of sleep apnea in the population? More common for obstructive than central.",

The following day after that short sleep, your vulnerability to cancer is presumably going to be increased because of that drop in NK cells. Now, getting lots and lots of sleep the following night is not going to go back in time and bend the arrow of time back on itself and wash away that cancer risk. Instead, what it’s going to mean is that for the day after you’ve got good sleep, your natural killer cell count is going to be presumably back up. Therefore you’re now de-risking your cancer risk by way of getting good sleep.",

  "content": "In the previous AMA, Matt discussed how less sleep is associated with an increase in biomarkers of age. But does poor sleep really cause faster aging? Firstly, Matt admits that sleep and aging is a bi-direction system. It goes both ways. I.e., aging causes poor sleep, but poor sleep also causes aging. But the question then becomes… Is the traffic flowing more dominantly in one direction than another?",

  "content": "So, when does Matthew feel comfortable making claims of causality? Only when he sees evidence in epidemiological studies, experimental human studies, and experimental animal studies. That’s the point where you start to feel comfortable speaking about causality. Ways to test causality: First in people, we can take someone who has no anxiety, take sleep away, hold all of the factors constant and see if anxiety is induced. That’s causal manipulation. But let’s be self-critical there: Perhaps it’s just the stress of being sleep deprived that causes the anxiety and not the lack of sleep itself. Do an animal study where you can actually remove the adrenal glands to therefore remove the cortisol response that is producing the stress. You can hold the stress response constant and you can deprive them of sleep and you can look at anxious behavior, and you’ll see the same thing.",

  "content": "For someone struggling with severe insomnia, is it better to get almost no sleep or to take an antihistamine or mild benzos as a sleep aid? Matt admits that this is a very tough question. Firstly, people very quickly build a tolerance to antihistamines. And then they can typically have rebound insomnia when they come off of antihistamines and/or benzos. Matt suggests first going through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI). If that doesn’t work, then “I don’t know the right answer to that”. In 2016, the American College of Physicians made the recommendation that sleeping pills must no longer be the first line recommended treatment for insomnia due to their harmful (even fatal) consequences and that the first treatment must be CBTI.",

  "content": "Matt says that these “binaural beats” or other downloaded sound files don’t have any good scientific studies that have really demonstrated efficacy. Studies have been done where people will actually measure your deep sleep brainwaves. They will use these short bursts of sound that try to predict when that next deep sleep brainwave is going to arrive. And at the sort of “stroke of midnight” they will play the auditory tone. And if you do that, what you can actually induce is a larger size, a bigger amplitude of deep sleep brainwave activity. And you can get some memory benefits from that. But here’s the problem… First, if your timing is off and you’re striking at 6 rather than midnight, you’re actually going to inhibit your deep sleep brainwaves. Secondly, if you’re doing it all night, the brain will actually start to fight back. At best, it becomes ineffective. At worst, it could become sleep disruptive.",

But in Peter’s experience with fasting, he finds it produces an amazing state of sleep (albeit slightly less duration) but better in quality. Does this surprise Matthew? Yes and no, he says. He says “no” because we don’t really have good data. The only decent data we have is with people practicing Ramadan where their REM sleep is negatively affected. Peter points out that Ramadan isn’t true fasting it’s just fasting during the day time and they feed at night time so they are almost in a “hyper fed state”. The Ramadan data is probably better at helping us learning something about meal timing’s effect on sleep for someone practicing time-restricted feeding and suggests and earlier window of eating is better.",
