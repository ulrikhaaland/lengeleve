FFMI is used equally, but truthfully has some confounders in there because you’re looking at the entire mass of the individual, which includes organs. Therefore, you’re getting a lot of other mass in there that isn’t directly muscle mass. There’s a quite strong correlation between FFMI and ALMI, but we do see discordance. When we do see discordance, we tend to favor the ALMI.

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "An obvious trend is that people tend to lose muscle as they age. They add fat mass as they age. And BMD goes down as you age. So everything’s going in the wrong direction as you age. Therefore, the objective becomes: During what window of time can we actually increase these things before we get to the point where it becomes very difficult to make increases? Another way to state that is, there’s a point at which decline becomes almost inevitable. So you want to be as high as you can, going into that phase. And that’s particularly relevant for BMD. When it comes to muscle mass… “Find me one example in history where a 90-year-old said, ‘God, I wish I had less muscle. I just wish I wasn’t so strong.’” says Peter. So you simply can’t enter your eighth decade over muscled. And therefore, that’s really what we need to do: Add and protect muscle. Peter says a patient who’s 50 years old, who’s at the 50th percentile for one of the muscle metrics, he’s not “losing sleep” over that. If they’re at the 30th percentile, he’s not losing sleep over that either because we’re playing a long game. If you are at that 30th percentile now, there is a path in five years to get you to the 80th percentile, but you’re not going to get there in a year. But this really allows Peter to frame things for patients in the direction of the centenarian decathlon. Just know that it can take years to see full scale changes on DEXA scans.",

You have to accept that there’s noise in this system and if you do DEXA scans on two consecutive days, you’re not going to get the same thing. Even though DEXA is still what we consider the gold standard, it’s quite dependent on hydration because remember, it’s differentiating bone, fat, and “other” (and water counts as other). It’s important to be cognizant of these things when you do this type of testing. Other trends really just come down to a person’s athletic history. People who have a history of resistance training tend to have a higher ALMI and FFMI. Another thing Peter sees is that people who have restrictive diets tend to be lower in lean mass. That’s even true if they’re resistance training. The fact is that if you’re really, really restrictive, you’re going to lose lean mass.

Losing weight is not the hardest problem in the world, but keeping weight off is a challenging problem. One of the things that you want to look at when you look at this study is, what was the feeding window for the ad lib group? The people who were able to eat whenever they could eat, what was going on? In this study, they were eating over about 11 hours (plus or minus one hour) for the ad lib feeding window for the control group versus the strict eight hours that was the feeding for the other group.",

  "title": "Three strategies for reducing energy intake in over-nourished patients",
  "date": "October 17, 2022",
  "context": "Body Composition",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "If you’re in the over-nourished camp, we have to reduce energy intake and there are three broad ways to do that: 1 – The first way is direct caloric restriction. Which means if you’re consuming 3,000 calories a day right now, we’re going to cut that down to 2,500 calories per day. We’re not going to pay attention to when you eat those calorie. We’re not even really paying attention to what those calories are, but there’s going to be an energy deficit. 2 – The second strategy to reduce intake is dietary restriction. This basically means “make something a bogeyman, and never eat it”. 3 – The final way is time restricted feeding (TRF). This means we’re not going to ask you to count how many calories you’re eating and we’re not even going to tell you what not to eat. We’re just going make the window in which you eat narrower and narrower.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter doesn’t view fasting as a weight loss strategy because you’re going to gain the weight back once you stop. If you don’t eat for three days, within two days after, you have all that weight back. There’s some exceptions to that…maybe there’s a few patients where doing a three-day fast once a month, coupled with enormous TRF and caloric restriction on the other 27 days, was part of the overall strategy. But for the most part, Peter doesn’t really want people to think about fasting as a weight loss strategy.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "If we’re going to make the case to do a fast, the case based on purging senescent cells, autophagy, all sorts of things…Then we have to acknowledge, we’re taking a bit of a leap of faith. We don’t really have biomarkers for any of these things. So it’s hard to make a great case for them. A lot of biomarkers get better when you fast, but you don’t need to be fasting to get those benefits. The biomarkers (or the biological measurements) that really matter, we can’t measure yet. Hence, this leap of faith is necessary. Peter thinks that the field of metabolomics will be able to unlock a lot of this stuff, combined with proteomics as well. Proteomics and metabolomics will, with a reasonable amount of computing power which already exists, it’s really just a question of doing the studies. So yeah, Peter sees this happening in the coming decade for sure.",

  "content": "Peter doesn’t want to be the anti-TRF guy anymore than he would want to be the pro-TRF guy. You got to be agnostic to this stuff. If TRF is working for you according to all metrics that we have available, by all means, stay with it. Worth noting that there are ways to do TRF a little more intelligently, such as using protein outside of the feeding window. For instance, if you really want to do an 18/6 feeding window where you’re just committed to eating two big meals between noon and 6:00 PM, Peter would still encourage you to consume a protein shake that is otherwise relatively low calorie outside of that window.",

  "date": "October 17, 2022",
  "context": "Body Composition",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "What about the theories around time-restricted feeding and what they can do to influence circadian rhythms? Peter does think there’s something to be acknowledged between the relationship between food and sleep. There’s no circumstance under which I think it makes sense to be eating right before bed. There’s no upside to eating your biggest meal at 9:00 PM and then going to bed at 10:00 or 11:00 because you’re then going to see higher glucose levels at night, higher cortisol levels at night, and you’re going to see less regulated sleep. Therefore, that’s another argument that says, “look, regardless of how we’re telling a patient to eat, sleep is very important. And we really would like to see people not eating within ideally three hours before bed.”",
