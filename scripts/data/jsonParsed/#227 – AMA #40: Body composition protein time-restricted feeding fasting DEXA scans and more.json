  "content": "DEXA scan is a moving X-ray that provides important metrics about body composition. It distinguishes three things: bone, fat, and other. DEXA gives four broad pieces of information: body fat, bone mineral density (BMD), an estimate of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI). These measures provide insights into lean mass or muscle mass in the extremities. The radiation levels from a DEXA scan are typically less than 20 microsieverts, which is virtually radiation-free compared to other medical scans. It is recommended to do a DEXA scan once or twice per year.",

  "content": "DEXA scan results are compared against a population stratified by sex and age to determine where an individual ranks and what interventions may be needed. Body fat is calculated by dividing the total amount of fat by the total mass of the individual. BMD is reported in an absolute amount in grams per centimeter squared and also in a z-score. VAT is estimated based on the amount of fat in the torso, subtracting what is believed to be in the subcutaneous space. ALMI and FFMI are measures of lean mass in the extremities, reported as total amount of lean tissue divided by height in meter squared.",

The meal after a workout is also important, especially for those who are untrained.

And while something like a one-hour window is likely to achieve a deficit, the big trade off is protein—it’s very difficult to get your total amount of protein in one meal.
