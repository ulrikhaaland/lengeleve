Based on his work with metformin, Nir shares how he believes it could be a pro-longevity drug and the clinical trial he’s leading to test this belief. Joan discusses her work with rapalogs, their ability to suppress the immune system as well as provide immune-enhancement, and the clinical trials she has led that inform her insights. We also talk about the potential beneficial roles of both metformin and rapamycin in reducing mortality from COVID-19, reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and delaying aging as well as its related diseases.",

Extracellularly, metformin downregulated Insulin/IGF1 signaling, also leading to mTORC1 inhibition. The inhibition of mitochondrial ETC also leads to AMPK-independent effects including reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and thereby reduced macromolecular damage. The AMPK-independent anti-inflammatory and senotherapeutic effects of metformin are evident via the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, NF-κB signaling, and activation of Nrf2-Gpx7 and ATM-signaling, respectively. These three arms work to mitigate the aging-induced dysregulation in cells, thereby attenuating hallmarks of aging.",

With aging, methylation is either increasing or decreasing, and very often the consequences is a change in a gene activity. People like Horvath and Morgan Levine have looked at methylation sites and tried to correlate them to chronological age.",

You then apply an intervention that is beneficial (rapamycin, metformin, etc.). Fast forward to another time point—even if you have not undone methylation, how do you know you haven’t done good that is proactive as opposed to retroactive?",

If Joan had unlimited funding, what experiment would she do to test the hypothesis of RTB101 with respect to immune function? Phase 3 trial in an elderly population. She would look at lab confirmed respiratory tract infections, including COVID-19, and see if they could reduce the severity of illness. She would have 3 groups. RTB101. A rapalog (Everolimus). Placebo. Note: she would NOT add the combo of RTB101+rapalog because that didn’t work as well in resTORbio’s phase 2B study. How and when would she dose the drug? There’s a peak of hospitalizations and deaths in people, particularly 70 and older, right during the 4 months of winter cold and flu season. She would give the drug during that period and show that they have decreased hospitalization, and decreased severe symptoms. Joan’s view is that the most benefit is coming from when the patient is on drug as opposed to post-wash out.",

  "title": "Peter's Take on Preparedness for Future Viruses",
  "date": "August 10, 2020",
  "context": "Science of Aging",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter’s take on what should be the focus—The FDA and scientific community needs to adapt and increase their tolerance for risk when studying agents like metformin and rapamycin. We clearly need to do to be prepared for future viruses. Contact tracing. Stockpile of PCR tests and reagents for PCR. Stockpile of antiviral meds. And we need more immune modulating therapy options. For more on preparedness, see episode of The Drive with Stanley Perlman. Our goal should be making people more resilient. We should fund large studies looking at what definitively enhances our immune system. Things like… Sleep. Vitamin D & C. Metformin. Rapamycin. Etc. “My view is that there are agents like metformin and rapamycin that could play a significant role in preparedness. Basically what it really comes down to is resilience. That’s really what you’re talking about, is host resilience.” —Peter Attia. Joan’s take: Rapalogs may have a double benefit—1) Low doses would be used to prevent infections and severity of infections. 2) High doses that are immunosuppressive might actually have benefit for that over-reaction of the immune system in response to COVID-19. Here’s a small study out of Hong Kong showing an mTOR inhibitor was beneficial for patients with severe influenza and here’s a clinical trial looking at rapamycin in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A word of caution: We definitely need more data on drugs like rapamycin and metformin — “I do think these shouldn’t be used until we PROVE that they have benefit.” Nir offers some advice: “I don’t want to see studies that are not clinical studies. That’s my whole schtick here. I think we want, and we need, to find how we do things effectively, as fast as possible, and that it’s still led by science.”",
