  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Peter had a patient who was dialed in on basically everything but metabolically he wasn’t responding. This patient had never dealt with a very traumatic event in her life. And it was only when attention was finally turned to really dealing with that with psychotherapy and the correct pharmacotherapy that all the other metabolic things got in place. This patient was discussed in the episode of The Drive with Paul Conti. “There’s a clear mind/body connection that is not just some sort of touchy-feely nonsense. It’s completely and it can’t be discounted.”",
