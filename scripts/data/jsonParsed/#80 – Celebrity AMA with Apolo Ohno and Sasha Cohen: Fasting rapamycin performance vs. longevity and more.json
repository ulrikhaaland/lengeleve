  "content": "Women may have a harder time fasting, and tips for those who are struggling. There may be some evolutionary reasons why women struggle more with fasting. For people who struggle, it's suggested to start with 18 hr fasts with 6 hr eating window, then move to 1 meal per day, and then a 36 hour fast. It's important to check glucose levels to get some insight into why energy might be so low. When fasting, it's important to not push through if you feel unwell, and to drink more water than you think. When you fast you excrete sodium at a higher rate and food has water in it so you need to compensate for that.",

For diet, anything that is going to minimize swings in glucose is preferred. Fasting and cognitive performance is unclear, but there is anecdotal evidence of more mental clarity. Exogenous ketones could potentially help.",

  "content": "Fasting might be used in athletes for manipulating testosterone levels and for injury recovery/regeneration. However, testosterone levels tend to plummet after a 7 day fast. The literature on inflammation and fasting clearly shows a reduction in inflammation. Additionally, everybody almost without exception notices that little aches and pains just vanish. When fasting, top end endurance is lower and more recovery time is needed in between sets. An alternative strategy for athletes could be Hypocaloric feeding with creatine supplementation, where you’re eating 750 to a 1,000 calories per day. You still could get enough glycogen replacement which is good because that’s probably where the athletes are hurt the most with a water-only fast combined with training volume.",
