Don’t cut caffeine for a long fast if you are a big caffeine person.",

Peter personally has felt remarkably sharp while in ketosis. Exogenous ketones. Peter says taking a ketone ester could help (as it seems to have helped him in the past). Peter suggests that as something Apolo could try out. In summary: “If I were in that situation, I don’t think I would fast during that window necessarily. I’d probably do some time restriction and eat a really clean diet that, even if it wasn’t fully ketogenic, it would probably be relatively low carb.”",

So the single leg step back (or step up) lunge. Or perhaps a single leg “get up” off a low surface. Finally, he’d to handstand push ups. Put legs up on a wall, but not in a “full stand” position (you don’t need to be under that much stress). Peter’s doing this as a scapular exercise (good way to train serratus strength and shoulder stabilizers)",

Peter thinks most athletes are over-training in volume and intensity and under training and specificity. An alternative strategy for athletes is hypocaloric feeding with creatine supplementation.",
