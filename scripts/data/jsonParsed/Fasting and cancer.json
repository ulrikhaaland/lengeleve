  "content": "The study aimed to find out if fasting could protect the intestines from high-dose radiation, which could allow for higher doses of radiation treatment in killing pancreatic tumor cells. Not only did the investigators demonstrate that fasting improved survival and intestinal cell regeneration, they also found that fasting improved the survival of mice with pancreatic tumors also subjected to lethal doses of abdominal radiation. The investigators also noted that the protection conferred by fasting applied only to the normal tissues, whereas the pancreatic tumors were not radioprotected, and actually may have been more vulnerable as a result of the 24-hour fast.",

  "content": "Fasting and/or dietary restriction has been shown to improve the tolerability of toxic cancer therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy). A 2019 review points to several studies in which forms of fasting protects normal cells in mice from the damage induced by chemotherapy and other toxic drugs while differentially making cancer cells more vulnerable.",
