  "content": "Inferior fuel partitioning, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose disposal, and a tendency to probably eat more junk food are some of the dietary changes that occur when you are sleep deprived. Fuel partitioning is affected by sleep, and respiratory quotient goes up when sleep deprived, which signals a metabolic inefficiency. Peter Attia says that he finds it hard to avoid junk food when he is sleep deprived, and that sleep is probably the single greatest tool in his arsenal to eat well.",
