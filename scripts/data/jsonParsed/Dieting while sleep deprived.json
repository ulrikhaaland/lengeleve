  "content": "Dietary changes when you are sleep deprived include inferior fuel partitioning, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose disposal, and a tendency to probably eat more unhealthy food. The energy balance of an organism, how much to eat and how the body uses it, is affected by sleep. The respiratory quotient goes up when sleep deprived, implying that under the same level of exertion, you would preferentially go after glycogen for ATP, as opposed to fat, signaling a metabolic inefficiency.",

  "content": "A study showed that dieting when underslept (6 hrs or less) was much less effective in terms of fat loss. If underslept, 70% of what you lose is from lean muscle mass as the body holds onto fat. A big reason for this is the high levels of cortisol (stress hormone) and insulin.",
