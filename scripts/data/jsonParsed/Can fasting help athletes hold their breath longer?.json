  "content": "Freediving is a sport of diving underwater without the use of a breathing apparatus. The major limit to holding your breath for an extended period is not due to a lack of oxygen (O2), but to a trapping of the molecule that we release into the atmosphere with every exhalation: carbon dioxide (CO2). In a small study of 13 elite freedivers, the average breath-hold duration was four minutes and 15 seconds in laboratory settings. The average duration of the max breath-hold in the fasting condition (4:41) was 50 seconds longer than in the fed condition (3:51). The investigators concluded that fasting is beneficial for STA performance in elite divers.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In competitive apnea, a crucial component is minimizing metabolic demands. A lower metabolic rate means relatively less O2 is needed or consumed by the body. The less O2 consumed, the less CO2 produced, and as noted above it’s the rising internal CO2 levels that triggers involuntary muscle contractions of the respiratory system. The ongoing digestive process and the increased blood and O2 perfusion to the gut after a meal may hamper the diving response. It’s possible that one key advantage of the fasting condition is that it eliminates the disadvantages of attempting a max breath-hold in the fed condition.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Longer-term fasts, such as a 5-day water-only fast, have a demonstrable effect on other measures of metabolism that may benefit an elite freediver. Typically, for fasts three days or longer, there are changes in thyroid hormones associated with a lower metabolic rate and a concomitant decrease in O2 demand. Also, the longer the fast, the higher the production and availability of ketone bodies.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The most abundant of the ketone bodies, beta-hydroxybutyrate, serves as an alternative fuel source to glucose and free fatty acids, which may also lower O2 demand. A detailed study on the metabolism of ketones showed that giving BOHB to the perfused rat heart in place of glucose increased work output, but decreased O2 consumption. The muscles became more efficient, requiring less O2 for the same amount of mechanical work.",

  "content": "The beneficial effects of a 13-hour fast in the context of higher breath-hold durations may be enhanced by prolonging the fast or following a Calorie-restricted ketogenic diet because it should substantially increase the concentration of BOHB, thus lower O2 demand, increase the time it takes for CO2 to build up, and extend the window of time it takes before the first aforementioned involuntary breathing movements take hold in elite divers.",

  "content": "The longer the fast, the lower the metabolic rate, and the higher the BOHB, resulting in a lower demand for O2. Longer-term fasting induces a lower metabolic rate and the cells are less challenged by low O2 availability because they consume less O2. Those cells also benefit by having and using more BOHB, because it’s the most efficient fuel, resulting in decreased O2 consumption, relative to glucose or free fatty acids, the predominant fuels in a fed state. This O2 conservation means less CO2 production.",
