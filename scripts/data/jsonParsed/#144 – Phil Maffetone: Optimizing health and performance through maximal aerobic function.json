Therefore, if you stay under a certain HR, you’re in an aerobic state. Despite common belief, VO2 max is not a great predictor of much. The research actually says that you can’t predict marathon finish time by VO2 max. But people don’t like hearing that because they have this idea that VO2 max is directly associated with performance. They think they need to rev up their VO2 max by doing hard training, which will get them performing better, and that’s where the whole system breaks down.",

An individual’s maximum aerobic heart rate was originally derived with a combination of a physical exam in his (history, lab work, posture, strength, etc.); and observing the person on a track.

For example, sugar consumption is actually declining, but it sometimes takes awhile for this decline to necessarily translate into some of the health benefits. Furthermore, these things are so multifaceted. For example, activity levels might be declining even while certain elements of nutrition improve, and so the net effect of that could be a reduction. E.g., Quality of sleep could be declining, and that can offset any benefit that we see. Phil’s message around that: 1-Start with walking. All a deconditioned person needs to do is start by walking around the block. The fat burning benefits that they’ll get from that simple act are huge. 2-Food is more important. 3-Reducing stress is also a key factor. Final message:  “Food and exercise are keys. And it’s really, really simple. Just don’t eat junk food, and take it easy out there.”",
