Occasionally in the lab, athletes would come across that would make people say, Wow, this is amazing. How could this person burn so much fat? We don’t understand this. It must be a problem. But as the years went by, it was clearly not a problem at all—in fact it was a great thing. By staying close to his patients, it was always known that athletes were getting healthier— I know they’re burning more fat because they’re running faster at the same MAF heart rate. Then, gradually started thinking more scientifically about this… And the fat burning component became that factor that we can measure more and more. It was able to determine that this type of lower-intensity training and lower-carb eating impacted people’s capacity to burn fat.",
