Spoiler alert: four days of sleep restriction (4.5 hours of sleep/night) resulted in an insulin-resistant state in fat tissue in healthy adults. What this study lacked in size it makes up for reasonably in control. Would love to see this repeated over a longer period time, with more subjects, with less extreme sleep deprivation (e.g., maybe 5.5 to 6 hours/night), and with state-of-the-art sleep measurements to actually tie the physiologic changes to loss of sleep stage. I would especially like to see more about tissue-specific insulin resistance: in addition to fat tissue, what is going on at the skeletal muscle, and liver, in the short- and long-term when sleep is compromised?",
