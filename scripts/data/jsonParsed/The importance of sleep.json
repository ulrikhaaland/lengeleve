  "content": "If you eat well, exercise regularly, and get adequate sleep, and one of these had to be compromised, sleep would be the most crucial to guard. A study done by Eve Van Cauter and her colleagues in 2012 showed that four days of sleep restriction (4.5 hours of sleep/night) resulted in an insulin-resistant state in fat tissue in healthy adults. This suggests that sleep deprivation can lead to significant health issues. Further research is needed to understand the impact of sleep deprivation on different tissues, such as skeletal muscle and liver, in the short- and long-term.",
