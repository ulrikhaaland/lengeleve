  "content": "Avoiding late-night snacking has long been recommended to those trying to lose weight, and this recommendation appears to be well-founded: numerous studies have found a strong correlation between eating late at night and an increased risk of obesity. Two recently published randomized controlled trials further emphasized the metabolic benefits of consuming calories earlier in the day versus closer to bedtime.",

  "content": "In one study, sixteen subjects with BMIs classified as overweight or obese were randomized to either an 'early' or 'late' eating protocol. After a 2-day period to allow participants to adjust to the experimental setting, they underwent four days on their randomly assigned feeding regimen. The same three isocaloric meals were consumed by both groups. On the first and last day of each feeding protocol, experimenters measured subjects’ energy expenditure (EE) and fuel utilization by indirect calorimetry over the 16-hour wake episode. On these test days, participants also self-reported their levels of hunger and appetite using visual analog scales. Another study recruited 30 participants, also with BMIs classified as overweight or obese. At the start of the study, each participant was randomly assigned to eat either a morning-loaded diet or an evening-loaded diet. Once participants completed four weeks of either the ML or EL protocol, they underwent a 1-week washout period before crossing over to the other arm of the study for an additional four weeks. This research group also measured perceived appetite and energy expenditure, though the latter was done using the doubly-labelled water method under free-living (out of laboratory) conditions.",

  "title": "Late Eating Increases Appetite and Fat Storage",
  "date": "January 21, 2023",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Both studies reported that eating later in the day resulted in significantly increased self-reported ratings of hunger level relative to eating early, despite each study matching diet composition and calorie intake across protocols. Neither study reported a difference in weight changes between protocols. One study also assayed blood samples on test days for circulating levels of the satiety-signaling hormone leptin, which were found to provide quantitative, objective support for the differences in reported hunger. The area under the curve of leptin concentration throughout the day was elevated among early eaters relative to late eaters, which would be consistent with the participants’ reports of decreased hunger on the early protocol. The same study also collected biopsies of white adipose tissue to study the potential effects of late eating on adipose tissue gene expression, which was altered in a way consistent with decreased lipolysis and increased adipogenesis.",

  "title": "Late Eating May Decrease Energy Expenditure",
  "date": "January 21, 2023",
  "context": "Nutritional Biochemistry",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Using indirect calorimetry, one study team also observed significantly decreased daytime EE among those on a late-eating protocol. In contrast, the other study reported no difference between morning-loaded and evening-loaded diet groups. While this discrepancy might suggest that late eaters compensate for reduced daytime EE with elevated EE during the sleep cycle, one study presents core body temperature (CBT) measurements which argue against that conclusion. No difference was observed between groups in overnight CBT, whereas daytime CBT was significantly lower among late eaters, consistent with EE measurements by calorimetry.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The results of both studies provide further evidence to support the idea that snacking close to bedtime is not a wise practice for those aiming to lose fat mass or keep it off. Late eating can increase appetite and possibly reduce energy expenditure. Even modest shifts in calorie load toward earlier in the day would yield benefits.",

  "content": "Studies of longer duration that allow participants to modulate their total intake based on hunger level will still be important to ascertain the overall effect of early vs. late eating schedules on the development of obesity. Short-term studies provide plenty of reason to think twice before grabbing a late-night snack.",
