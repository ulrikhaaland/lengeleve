  "content": "Both Vujovic et al. and Ruddick-Collins et al. reported that eating later in the day resulted in significantly increased self-reported ratings of hunger level relative to eating early, despite each study matching diet composition and calorie intake across protocols. Vujovic et al. also found that late eating altered adipose tissue gene expression in a way consistent with decreased lipolysis and increased adipogenesis.",

  "content": "Using indirect calorimetry, the Vujovic et al. team also observed significantly decreased daytime EE among those on a late-eating protocol, reporting that this group expended an average 59.4 ± 13.9 fewer kcal (5.03% less) per wake period than their early-eating counterparts, though it bears noting that this difference is near the sensitivity limit of their methodology. In contrast, Ruddick-Collins et al. – who monitored 24-hour energy expenditure via doubly-labeled water – reported no difference between EL and ML diet groups.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "While this discrepancy might suggest that late eaters compensate for reduced daytime EE with elevated EE during the sleep cycle, Vujovic et al. present core body temperature (CBT) measurements which argue against that conclusion. The authors note that although EE was not measured directly during sleep periods, CBT – a proxy of resting energy expenditure – was monitored continuously. No difference was observed between groups in overnight CBT, whereas daytime CBT was significantly lower among late eaters, consistent with EE measurements by calorimetry.",

  "content": "A more likely explanation for the apparent inconsistency in EE findings between studies lies in the details of the respective study designs. Vujovic et al’s. study involved complete shifts in meal times in early vs. late eating groups relative to sleep periods, whereas Ruddick-Collins et al.’s study involved only a shift in calorie distributions across meals, which were timed identically relative to sleep between both groups. In addition, Ruddick-Collins et al. allowed participants to choose their own mealtimes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, potentially adding enormous variability within groups in calorie distribution relative to sleep.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The results of both studies provide further evidence to support the idea that snacking close to bedtime is not a wise practice for those aiming to lose fat mass or keep it off. However, the Vujovic et al. study follows an overall stronger design and provides more robust mechanistic and quantitative data to support their findings that late eating can increase appetite and possibly reduce energy expenditure (and it’s likely the former is a greater contribution to weight gain than the latter). Still, the Ruddick-Collins et al. study, by virtue of its relatively poor control over participants’ diet patterns, manages to demonstrate that effects on appetite may be generalizable to more subtle changes in daily calorie load distribution, as well as to some level of variation in absolute meal and sleep times. It appears, in other words, that even modest shifts in calorie load toward earlier in the day would yield benefits.",
