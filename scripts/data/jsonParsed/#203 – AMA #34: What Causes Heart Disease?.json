  "content": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the number one killer in the developed world. It is important to understand ASCVD given its ubiquity and inevitability. Atherosclerosis can take hold at a very early age, and the role of cholesterol is significant. The causal factors of ASCVD determine prevention strategies. Important metrics and biomarkers found in blood work, as well as diagnostic tests such as coronary artery calcium scores (CAC) and CT angiograms help to determine the level of arterial damage present. Understanding and interpreting calcium scores are key.",

It is important to understand this disease early in life due to its huge impact and the significant tools available for its management. Extending lifespan involves delaying the onset of chronic diseases like atherosclerosis. Risk factors include smoking, hypertension, and high blood and lipid abnormalities. Studies show that ASCVD begins at a young age and early prevention is key.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "ASCVD is a disease state characterized by the deposition or the buildup of cholesterol in the artery wall. It begins with a fatty streak that later consolidates into plaques that can ultimately lead to a reduction in blood flow, called ischemia. Ischemia results in tissue damage to the heart and can result in a fatal heart attack. The presence of cholesterol in the artery wall defines atherosclerosis. Cholesterol is an organic molecule, a type of lipid, and is one of the most important molecules in the body. It is used for the cell membrane of every cell in the body and for the synthesis of many hormones.",

When you look again at the laboratory report and look at lipid concentrations, you’re looking at what the amount of cholesterol contained within the lipoproteins circulating within the plasma. Consider the biggest reduction in total cholesterol you could have. Let’s say you lowered your total cholesterol from 200 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL. Along the way, you lowered your LDL cholesterol from 130 mg/dL to 40 mg/dL. These are realistic numbers for what that type of dramatic reduction would do. Lipoproteins account for less than 10% of total body cholesterol. Even if you shrink the cholesterol in lipoproteins by 50%, you’re only reducing total body cholesterol by 4.5%. The vast majority of cholesterol still resides in peripheral tissue, and that’s where it’s being turned into hormones.",
