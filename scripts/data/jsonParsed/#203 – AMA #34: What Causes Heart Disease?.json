This is typically the cause of a heart attack. A heart attack does not occur because the lumen narrowed little by little. Typically there was some narrowing. But it’s the rupture of a plaque that leads to the sudden occlusion of blood flow. That’s why going back to what my pathology professor talked about 25 years ago, a very, very common presentation is sudden death. Those people don’t get a warning. They don’t get to say, “Oh god, I’m really having chest pain walking up the stairs today because I’m slowly losing blood supply to my heart.” People go from being fine to dead if that occlusion occurs in a place where restriction of blood flow is fatal. If it occurs at a very distal point in the blood supply, then it might not cause a fatal heart attack. If it occurs high enough, it can be a “Widowmaker”. A Widowmaker lesion is very, very high in the left main coronary artery. At such a level, if you occlude blood flow, you’re basically robbing the entire left ventricle of blood, which would be, universally fatal.",

  "content": "The CAC was really valuable for him because his lipids weren’t that high. Much of that risk was mediated through things that are not easy to measure, such as family history. At the other end of the spectrum, he has patients that are in their 60s who have “ragingly high lipids”, and they’re really hell bent about not taking lipid lowering medication. For them a calcium score becomes a very helpful way to assess whether or not lipid lowering medication should be discussed in greater detail.",

Peter would have this person get a CT angiogram because of all the reasons that calcification alone is not sufficient. He’s want to look at the lumen for evidence of soft plaque. He’s seen people in their 70s who have really normal CTA despite abnormal lipids, but they are the exception.",

  "content": "Thinking about CAC scores, when is calcium even starting to show up? This is a late stage event. The one at the most right (E) is where you start to see calcification occur. (E) shows a fibrocalcific lesion that can be picked up with a calcium score. The point here is how many people can still be missed. You can still be in A, B, C, D, and have a normal calcium score. Only in E is your calcium score abnormal. But a CT angiogram can pick up A, B, C, D. Every patient and doctor have to make the decision— when is it worth the additional cost and the slight increase in the amount of radiation to have a much better test than one that can only detect E? There’s nothing that’s black and white. It’s not every patient should do this, everyone should do this. It’s dependent on all these different factors, and together, which I think shows the importance of why diving into this and understanding.",

It turns out that the density of the calcium also matters. If you then look at just the differences in the Hounsfield units at the calcification of the coronary artery, that tells you something. The denser the calcium, the lower the risk.",
