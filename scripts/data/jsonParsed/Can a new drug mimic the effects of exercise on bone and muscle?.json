  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The LAMZ-treated cells had a much higher expression of the protein PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha). This transcriptional coactivator enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and regulates the genes involved in energy metabolism. The increased expression of PGC-1α stimulated the differentiation of osteoblasts and myotubes, which would lead to an increase in bone deposition and muscle fiber formation.",

  "content": "The mice treated with LAMZ showed increases in muscle fiber size and bone deposition, but without any reported changes in body composition. The influence of LAMZ with declining levels of sex hormones will need to be compared to these initial results to determine if the drug will be effective in older populations. Each experiment was conducted over 14 days, the equivalent of a few months in humans, so other side effects might not show up in this timeframe.",

  "content": "LAMZ was not able to completely stop the sarcopenic and osteoporotic effects of disuse, so this drug is not a replacement for exercise (or an excuse to be sedentary) in the average person. Exercise is essential for increasing aerobic capacity, cardiac output, and insulin sensitivity. Exercise is also an effective means to improve cognition and mood while lowering stress. LAMZ cannot mimic these myriad effects of exercise beyond muscle anabolism and bone deposition.",
