  "content": "Fragility is the enemy of performing the activities of daily living. If you want to be able to walk up the stairs or play with kids on the floor well into your 80s and 90s, you’re going to need to counteract the inevitable age-related losses of muscle and bone tissue. Resistance exercise is one of the most potent ways to reduce sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and strength, and osteoporosis, the loss of bone mineral content.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Researchers have recently reported their discovery of a new drug that leads to some of the same effects on bone and muscle as locomotion. This drug, named 'locamidazole' or LAMZ, could potentially be an alternative to exercising, especially in cases where exercise is not a viable option, such as in patients with dementia, or during temporary bed rest, such as after a hip fracture.",

  "date": "March 25, 2023",
  "context": "Exercise & Physical Health",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "When administered daily via an oral route in healthy mice, LAMZ effectively entered the bloodstream and was taken up by muscle and bone. After 14 days, the mice treated with LAMZ had increased muscle fiber width, which translated to fewer episodes of fatigue during a fixed 15-minute duration of treadmill running and greater maximal muscle strength. Micro-CT showed that mice treated with LAMZ had increased bone volume, improved trabecular bone thickness, and increased bone mineral content.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The LAMZ-treated cells had a much higher expression of the protein PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha). This transcriptional coactivator enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and regulates the genes involved in energy metabolism. The increased expression of PGC-1α stimulated the differentiation of osteoblasts and myotubes, which would lead to an increase in bone deposition and muscle fiber formation.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The initial findings may seem exciting, but there are several reasons to remain skeptical that these results will translate to humans. Even with increases in muscle fiber size and bone deposition, the mice treated with LAMZ didn’t change weight and remained the same weight as the controls. The overall metabolic implications remain unknown without any reported changes in body composition. While there were no adverse effects seen on routine blood test monitoring, there may be other long-term effects of LAMZ, since calcium signaling and PGC-1α have a wide range of functions.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Despite its significant effects relative to control treatment, LAMZ was not able to completely stop the sarcopenic and osteoporotic effects of disuse, so this drug is not a replacement for exercise (or an excuse to be sedentary) in the average person. Beyond the effects on muscle and bone, there is currently no evidence that LAMZ positively influences the cardiovascular system, the nervous system, or overall metabolism. Exercise is essential for increasing aerobic capacity, cardiac output, and insulin sensitivity. Being able to walk up a flight of stairs requires sufficient cardiorespiratory capacity and neuromuscular control, not just adequate bone and muscle mass. Exercise is also an effective means to improve cognition and mood while lowering stress.",
