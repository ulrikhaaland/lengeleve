  "content": "BJ Miller is a hospice and palliative care specialist on a quest to reframe our relationship with death. In this episode, BJ begins with how his own brush with death radically shifted his perspective and ultimately forged his path towards palliative care and helping patients integrate and understand their life in a meaningful way. BJ recounts several moving stories from his patients, which reveal important lessons about overcoming the fear of death, letting go of regret, and what’s most important in life. He discusses the major design flaws of a “death phobic” healthcare system. Furthermore, he makes the case that seeing death as a part of life allows us to live well, as opposed to living to evade death itself. He concludes with a discussion around physician-assisted death as well as his hopes around the use of psychedelics to reduce suffering in end-of-life care.",

We can think about that together. We can talk about it and then we can make a life that responds to that big question.”\nExamples: \nIf someone is worried about “judgement day”, then the solution is to help them behave differently in the time they have left\nIf someone’s fear is not living forever, “my favorite means to living forever is to think about the world beyond yourself; invest yourself in the world beyond yourself so when your self dies, that thing you love keeps going.”\n“This is where it gets really, really fascinating, the relationship between self and other and what to do about that. Religious thinking, spiritual pursuits, this is what can open up when you admit that you’re freaked out to be dead.” —BJ Miller\nPeter’s personal fear is around leaving his family behind, and missing out on the future generations\nBJ’s point is that you CAN live through those things, but you have to make the investment, it doesn’t happen automatically\nThe irony is that you have to do it while you’re still alive and well, you can’t wait until your last moments\nPalliative care should really begin much earlier in life\n“It’s such a shame that we forestall and keep it at bay when it’s this thing that could help us so, so much.”\n“Whether actually a palliative care referral or a palliative care mindset, but one way or another finding our way into this subject while we’ve got plenty of road in front of us, is absolutely the right, best way.”",
