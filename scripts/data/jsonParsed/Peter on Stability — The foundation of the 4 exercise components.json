Stability is the cornerstone upon which your strength is delivered, your aerobic performance is delivered and your anaerobic performance is delivered. And it’s the way that you do so safely.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Stability is a way that we transmit force from the body to the outside world in the safest manner possible across the muscles which are designed to carry that load as opposed to seeing the dissipation of force across joints that are not fit to do so. For example, when you pick up 60 pounds off the ground, the idea is you want all of that 60 pounds to be transmitted from your muscles to the ground and you don’t want anything dissipating out your back, knees, or hips.",

  "content": "Dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS) is a method to train proper stabilization and movements. This “force leakage” is the root cause of a lot of the chronic injuries that people have. Stability is probably what I think of as the foundation upon which everything should be done vis-a-vis exercise.",

The particular teacher matters a lot. Of the four pieces of exercise we’re going to talk about, this is the one that probably will take the most tinkering for people to find the right type of practitioners.",
