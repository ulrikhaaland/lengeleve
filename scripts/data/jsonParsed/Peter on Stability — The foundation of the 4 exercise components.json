It is a way to transmit force from the body to the outside world in the safest manner possible, across the muscles which are designed to carry that load, as opposed to seeing the dissipation of force across joints that are not fit to do so.",

DNS can help with inefficient movement patterns that result in force leakage around the scapula, elbow, knee, back, hips, etc. Stability is probably what Peter thinks of as the foundation upon which everything should be done vis-a-vis exercise.",
