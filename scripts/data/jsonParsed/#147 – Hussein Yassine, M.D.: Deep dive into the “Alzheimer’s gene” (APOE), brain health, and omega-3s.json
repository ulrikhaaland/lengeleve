We go on to discuss what these systems look like when something goes wrong and cognitive decline ensues. We talk about the evolutionary origins of the ApoE genotype, with specific attention to the ApoE4 allele and its association with AD. We spend time discussing ApoE4 implications for the brain’s fuel utilization, notably omega-3 fatty acids: EPA and DHA. We briefly pivot to the implications of recent omega-3 trials for cardiovascular disease and return to what we currently understand about EPA/DHA and brain health; we contemplate potential dietary interventions across the lifespan to preserve and prolong cognitive function.",

EPA is less abundant but may comport more anti-inflammatory properties compared to DHA. There is limited interconversion between DHA/EPA although EPA can become DHA and visa versa. Omega-3 fatty acids come from the diet. The human body cannot make DHA/EPA from scratch. ALA precursor is converted by a group of desaturases into DHA and EPA. Widely believed this conversion remains in the range of 0.5% to 5% at most. The U.S. is poor in DHA/EPA. DHA averages 100mg/day. Standard diet may not provide enough omega-3’s to the brain. It is likely that this contributes to disease pathogenesis. But supplementation effectiveness is not clear. A range of supplement trial results. Supplements range in type, quality, forms so trials are not all like-for-like. Supplementation can come in various forms but it has to be marine.

Moreover, the relationship between aging and deficiency status is not evident. The brain develops rapidly from birth to 6 years,  at which point it is almost fully developed.

So not only will you get cardiovascular benefit, but you will also get a brain benefit because the blood vessels in Alzheimer’s disease have as much of a role as the actual neurons and astrocytes and so forth.” — Hussein Yassine, M.D. Hussein’s upcoming publications on older E4 carrier fuel utilization. In an older E4 brain, once dementia starts there is a failure to utilize glucose as a  source of energy and phospholipase enzymes that facilitate cellular auto-digestion are upregulated. The enzyme is activated in the E4 brain to possibly extract FAs for its own neuronal myelin to produce ATP. Phospholipase A2 enzyme (PLA2) control omega-3 and omega-6 FA utilization in the brain. Calcium-dependent enzyme of phospholipase A2. Strongly upregulated in AD disease brains who also carry the E4 genotype vs non-AD brains with carry E4 genotype. The analysis accessed RUSH AD disease research archive and identified PLA2 enzymes that is hyperactive in E4 brains. ApoE4 brain activates these enzymes which take away FAs from the phospholipid membrane and degrades the Fas for ATP. The effect is neuronal inflammation and oxidative stress. Not the same patterns in non E4 carriers with AD dementia. Has implications for recommendations to younger E4 carriers vs older E4 carriers. Once E4 carriers have disease there is likely less benefit from ketone supplementation compared to non-carriers. The largest studies to date do not demonstrate beneficial response to supplementation once E4 carriers have disease. The degenerating blood brain barrier compromising the transport of ketone bodies, the same way it has compromised glucose and omega-3 FAs. Dietary interventions at this stage may not be very effective. Highlights the importance of getting the right intervention before you get to that stage.",

  "content": "Hussein does not recommend omega-3 supplementation due to lack of evidence. He can recommend that people have at least 1 serving of fatty fish per week. Epidemiology studies suggest that E4 carriers who consume 1 serving of fatty fish per week may be providing enough omega-3s to the brain to help mitigate disease longer-term. The best advice Hussein can give is to maintain adequate omega-3 consumption from fatty fish and not supplements and to control blood pressure and exercise throughout the lifespan. Exercise may help mitigate cognitive decline. PET imaging study reports that E4 carriers who exercise have less amyloid plaque buildup compared to E4 carriers who did not exercise. Multiple factors including high level of education and hypertension control protected E4 carriers from dementia vs E4 carriers who had less education and worst blood pressure control.",
