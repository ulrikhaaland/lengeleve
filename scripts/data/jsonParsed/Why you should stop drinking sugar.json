  "content": "If you want to go on a zero fructose diet, you’re going to have a hard time. The first thing recommended is try not to drink liquids that have lots of sugar in them— soft drinks and fruit juices. Review of risks of liquid sugars, published in Obesity in 2019, Are Liquid Sugars Different from Solid Sugar in Their Ability to Cause Metabolic Syndrome? Soft drinks are about 11% sugar— 6% fructose and 5% glucose. This is on the order of 110 g total sugar per liter.",

  "date": "June 15, 2022",
  "context": "Sugar",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Sports drinks are interesting because some are really low in fructose. Maybe 2-4% fructose and 6% glucose. 6% glucose means there are 60 grams of glucose per liter. The original sports drinks were glucose rich and had a lot of salt and water. Some studies showed that oxidation of glucose could be facilitated by having a little bit of fructose in the drink. Having a small amount of fructose actually accelerated glucose uptake; this worked primarily in the gut. Performance was increased by having small amounts of fructose (2-3%) and the optimal glucose in sports drinks was found to be 5-6%. Now, some sports drinks actually have more fructose in it because it tastes better and that’s a problem. But for someone out there exercising, using a sports drink for what it’s meant for, then this is fine. But drinking sports drinks without exercise, in front of the TV, is probably not a good idea.",

  "content": "The sugar content of freshly squeezed orange juice is probably about two thirds of a soft drink. Apple juice is sweeter, it’s equivalent to a soft drink. The Pediatric Society a long time ago realized that juice has so much fructose that it was being associated with obesity in children. They made recommendations to limit fruit juice, to like 6 ounces or less for older children and 4 ounces or so for really small children.",
