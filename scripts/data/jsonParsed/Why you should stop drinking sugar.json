  "content": "Rick recommends avoiding liquids that have lots of sugar in them, such as soft drinks and fruit juices. Sports drinks are interesting because some are really low in fructose, maybe 2-4% fructose and 6% glucose. Soft drinks are about 11% sugar— 6% fructose and 5% glucose. The original sports drinks were glucose rich and had a lot of salt and water. Some studies showed that oxidation of glucose could be facilitated by having a little bit of fructose in the drink. The sugar content of freshly squeezed orange juice is probably about two thirds of a soft drink. Apple juice is sweeter, it’s equivalent to a soft drink. The Pediatric Society recommends limiting fruit juice, to like 6 ounces or less for older children and 4 ounces or so for really small children.",
