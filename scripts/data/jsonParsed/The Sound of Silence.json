  "content": "Matthew Walkerâ€™s book Why We Sleep notes that at every stage of human life, the relationship between NREM sleep and memory solidification is observed. Studies in chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans have also demonstrated this. The memory-maintaining benefit of NREM sleep remains on powerful display even in cats, rats, and insects.",

  "content": "Simon and Garfunkel's 'The Sound of Silence' encapsulates the process of memory solidification during sleep. The lyrics describe how the brain relays the day's waking events to the sleeping brain at night in the form of a vision, softly creeping. The fragile seeds of waking experience sown during the day are embedded in the brain during sleep, future-proofing memories. Recent evidence shows that sleep not only maintains memories learned before bed but also salvages those that appeared to have been lost soon after learning.",

  "content": "Following a night of sleep, you regain access to memories that you could not retrieve before sleep. Sleep offers a recovery service at night, repairing memory items and rescuing them from the clutches of forgetting. You awake the next morning able to locate and retrieve those once unavailable memory files with ease and precision.",
