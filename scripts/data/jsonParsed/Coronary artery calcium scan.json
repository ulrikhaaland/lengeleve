  "content": "Atherosclerosis takes the greatest proportion of lives when people are in their later years, but it’s a disease that takes a long time to evolve, starting in the first two decades of life. The process begins almost as soon as you’re born. By the time you’re in your 30s, and certainly into your 40s, there is ample evidence of the disease at autopsy. The etymology of atherosclerosis derives from athero—meaning a gruellike substance, and sclerosis—meaning a hardening. This porridge of oxidized sterols, lipids, cholesterol, macrophages, calcium, fibrin, and other cellular materials make up the lesions, or plaques, within the walls of the arteries. Influenced by multiple risk factors, the atherogenic process begins early in life and slowly progresses until the plaque narrows, erodes, or ruptures causing ischemic clinical events (e.g., fatal or non-fatal heart attack or stroke).",

  "content": "There is a tool that is gaining more recognition from academics, guidelines, clinicians, and patients called a coronary artery calcium (CAC) scan. The CAC scan, using computed tomography (better known as CT), assesses the presence and extent of coronary artery calcification (calcium being radio-opaque). The test reports on location and quantification of calcium within the three main coronary arteries and yields a numerical CAC score in a metric called Agatston Units. A patient with no calcification will have a score of “0” which escalates as vascular calcification increases. A score of “1” and above indicates the presence of calcification, most often in the form of hard plaque. Importantly, soft plaques can escape detection using a CAC scan. CAC score results fall into four categories which correlate with the severity of disease and range from no disease to severe disease.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A CAC score above zero tells you that there’s been a bad enough break-in to require repair. However, a lot can go on in the disease process leading up to that point that goes unnoticed by a CAC scan. Additionally, a CAC scan does not necessarily identify the plaques that might do the most damage. A low to zero CAC score suggests a lower risk of future events, but it does not mean a zero risk of future events. A CAC score is predictive and diagnostic, certainly a tool worth having in the toolbox, but it doesn’t tell you what else is under the hood.",

The latest guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) on the primary prevention of ASCVD suggest using the ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk for asymptomatic adults aged 40-79 years. Adults are then categorized into low (<5%), borderline (5 to <7.5%), intermediate (≥7.5 to <20%), or high (≥20%) 10-year risk.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "For people in the borderline or intermediate predicted risk categories, the ACC and AHA suggest the use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scans to help refine the risk assessment. A higher CAC score, particularly when it’s in the 75th to 100th age/sex/race percentile, can reclassify risk upward. A CAC score of zero can reclassify risk downward. If CAC = 0 for individuals with an intermediate risk (≥7.5-20%) estimate, these people can avoid statins if they don’t have any higher-risk conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes, family history of premature coronary heart disease, cigarette smoking) and it’s suggested they repeat the CAC scan in 5-10 years. If CAC is greater than 0, it’s deemed reasonable to use statins to benefit individuals and lower future risk of ASCVD.",

  "content": "Statin therapy, demonstrated to reduce the clinical manifestation of ASCVD, can lead to an increase in CAC, yet equally potent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering PCSK9i, which also reduce clinical events, do not. Statins directly reduce cholesterol synthesis and indirectly increase LDL clearance by the liver. PCSK9i inhibit PCSK9, which are chaperone proteins that essentially degrade LDL receptors (LDLR). By inhibiting this protein, more LDLR are recycled and used at the surface of the cell, leading to greater LDL clearance by cells (particularly the liver) where LDLR are expressed.",

This is referred to in the literature as the “statin paradox” or the “plaque paradox.” It’s possible that the observation of the plaques getting smaller and more calcified represents a conversion to a more stable plaque that’s less likely to rupture, although there doesn’t seem to be enough data to date to confirm or refute this hypothesis.",
