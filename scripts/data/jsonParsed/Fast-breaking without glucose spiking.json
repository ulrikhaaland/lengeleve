  "content": "A number of people note that they see big glucose spikes the day they complete their fast. A relatively recent paper reports a similar trend. A group out of Japan in 2017 took 10 healthy adults, provided them with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), and provided them with isoenergetic meals for 4 consecutive days. On days 1, 2, and 4, participants ate a higher carbohydrate diet, while on day 3, they ate a carbohydrate-restricted diet. What they found was that one day of almost complete carbohydrate-restriction led to post-meal glucose surges the next day when eating a higher carbohydrate diet.",

  "title": "Effects of Abrupt Diet Change",
  "date": "July 14, 2019",
  "context": "Fasting",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The authors suggested that if a carbohydrate-restricted diet is stopped abruptly and a lot of carbohydrates are reintroduced, it could cause a larger degree of post-meal hyperglycemia. This can also be the case with fasting that’s stopped abruptly. The increase in postprandial glucose levels could be caused by a decrease in insulin secretion and/or an increase in insulin resistance, and/or something else.",

  "title": "Insulin Resistance and Diet",
  "date": "July 14, 2019",
  "context": "Fasting",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Fasting or carbohydrate-restricted diets lower insulin levels, which leads to more circulating free fatty acids that can be utilized by muscle, and triggers insulin resistance in those muscles, sparing more glucose for the brain and red blood cells. Keto-adaptation can take weeks, and one of the reasons it may take this long is the muscle shifting from ketones and towards more free fatty acids for fuel, which now spares both glucose and ketones for the brain.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "If you plan on coming off a carbohydrate-restricted diet or a fast, and you’re reintroducing carbohydrates, the most sensible approach is a gradual reintroduction. Another possible tool is high-intensity exercise. This can help promote glucose uptake that’s independent of insulin, often referred to as non-insulin mediated glucose uptake. Emptying out some glycogen from muscle may help blunt any swings in glucose after a meal because of an increase in non-insulin mediated glucose uptake.",

  "title": "Personal Approach to Breaking a Fast",
  "date": "July 14, 2019",
  "context": "Fasting",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "When breaking a fast, it's recommended to optimize for minimizing discomfort and a behavioral response to a craving. This usually manifests itself as a salad with a bit of chili or some eggs, and generally try to take time, moving from smaller meals and lower carbohydrates, to larger (and more infrequent) ones, titrating up carbohydrate consumption along the way.",
