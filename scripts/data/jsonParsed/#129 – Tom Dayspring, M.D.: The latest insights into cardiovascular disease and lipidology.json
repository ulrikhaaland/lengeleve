PCSK9i don’t have an effect on the synthesis of apo(a) in the body, but we’re still trying to understand how Lp(a) particles are catabolized and cleared; it’s probably by multiple receptors. You get more LDL receptors with PCSK9i than a statin can. PCSK9i reduce the catabolism of apoB receptors and 3-4 other lipoprotein-clearing receptors, so on PCSK9i you get better clearance of particles than you do with LDL receptor expression mediated by statins (or statins plus another drug). Most of the time we use a stain plus a PCSK9i unless the patient can’t tolerate a statin. We still don’t have a lot of information about clearance of Lp(a) particles.",

  "content": "Having other molecules on or within LDLs and HDLs make them less clearable and more atherogenic. A very recent study showed that there are Lp(a) particles that carry ApoC-III. You’re not going to clear that if you make it. If TGs get into LDL, it has a great affinity for lipase enzymes that are looking for TGs. It binds to it and hydrolyzes TGs, and now you have small LDL or dense LDL. There is evidence that an increased total LDL particle number is not good, but small LDLs are more atherogenic than the more buoyant, larger LDLs. If LDL-TGs are high, there’s a high LDL particle count, a high ApoB, and small LDL particles. The TGs probably came from VLDLs and chylomicrons which became remnant-like proteins. TGs invading HDL particles affect their functionality too. In studies looking at LDL-TG, many inflammatory markers are high because those particles set off the inflammasome in endothelial cells and elsewhere. It’s a simple easy metric that tells us a lot. If it’s high, you’re likely dealing with an insulin resistant person rather than some less common genetic TG problem.",
