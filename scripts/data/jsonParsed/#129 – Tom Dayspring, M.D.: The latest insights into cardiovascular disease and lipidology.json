  "content": "World-renowned lipidologist Tom Dayspring returns to give an update on the current thinking in lipidology as a follow-up to his 2018 five-part podcast series. In this episode, Tom discusses the growing consensus that atherogenic lipoproteins are essential drivers of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Tom further emphasizes apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). He provides insights into risk assessment, including which lab metrics to use, how to interpret them, and the appropriate therapeutic targets. Additionally, Tom discusses the most recent developments in lipid-lowering drug therapies—from the continued evolution of PCSK9 inhibitors, to the latest understanding of EPA and DHA, and the most recent addition of bempedoic acid to the list of therapeutic agents.",

Once bound, it’s a water-soluble lipid transportation vehicle. The HDL particles have ApoA-I instead of ApoB. Called beta-lipoproteins with ApoB and alpha-lipoproteins with ApoA-I.

Liver makes apoB100 particles, some secreted, others catabolized into smaller particles: VLDL, IDL, and LDL, and Lp(a) if produced (not everyone does in significant amounts). The names derive from ultracentrifugation, float if lower density. So apoB family is VLDL, IDL, LDL, and Lp(a) if have it. But have to look at plasma residence times since these are the things that traffic sterols into artery wall. Chylomicrons: half life minutes, plasma residence a few hours. VLDL: half life 2-6 hours depending on how rapidly catabolized. ID: around for an hour or two, not a player. LDL: plasma residence 2-5 days. the longer it’s there, the more particles you have. Because of half life, 90-95% of apoB particles are LDL particles. So apoB is basically just another way of saying LDL particle count. Even if there are remnants, their particle number is small, so LDL is king and metrics use it (and non-HDL cholesterol).",

With diagnostics, it matters where the reference range is and if you’re moving it. We can’t always use the same lab, so apoB a better thing to measure. Pick your favorite metric and stick with it (Peter and Tom both use ApoB). For all biomarkers, try to use the same lab and assay. ApoB assay is commonly available and doesn’t vary widely like NMR. All guidelines talk about ApoB and get you fewer false positives when using ApoB. Peter says 2nd gen NMR is almost too sensitive, seeing discordance that exceeded predicted discordance, so started using ion mobility assay. Also economic reason – not expensive to measure ApoB (in Canada, $3-4), so that’s not an excuse. Allan Sniderman just mentioned the cost of ApoB assays in a paper – it’s no longer true that it’s prohibitively expensive.",

Statins can induce synthesis of the smaller apo(a) but do not affect synthesis of larger apo(a) moiety. (Even Sam Tsimikas will say don’t worry about statins raising Lp(a) – it’s a minority LDL particle.) Statins are still lowering the LDLs that matter clinically  2) PCSK9i don’t have an effect on the synthesis of apo(a) in the body, but we’re still trying to understand how Lp(a) particles are catabolized and cleared; it’s probably by multiple receptors.  You get more LDL receptors with PCSK9i than a statin can. PCSK9i reduce the catabolism of apoB receptors and 3-4 other lipoprotein-clearing receptors, so on PCSK9i you get better clearance of particles than you do with LDL receptor expression mediated by statins (or statins plus another drug). Most of the time we use a stain plus a PCSK9i unless the patient can’t tolerate a statin. We still don’t have a lot of information about clearance of Lp(a) particles. In Peter’s practice, he sees 0-70% reduction in Lp(a) in patients on PCSK9i.  This is a very broad range and the median reduction is maybe by a third. But keep in mind that Lp(a) is not an acceptable goal of therapy yet because there is no trial data to support it, so we are not making therapeutic decisions based on Lp(a) concentration",

Rosuvastatin is way more potent than pravastatin (both are hydrophilic and somewhat hepatoselective), so Tom uses it most of the time (unless third party payor issues).",

However, Tom thinks statins’ real contribution to risk reduction is apoB reduction. The idea is to start with a smaller dose of statin (depending on risk) and optimize with a second apoB-lowering drug such as Ezetimibe or Bempedoic acid.",

Ezetimibe blocks intestinal absorption of cholesterol or the backflow of bile cholesterol into the liver, increasing expression of LDL receptors and further depleting hepatic cholesterol pools. Bempedoic acid (BA) is an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor. The less you make, the less HMG you make, providing even less substrate for statins, and the result is lower ApoB.",

  "content": "BA is hepato-selective and has no uptake in muscle cells. Rosuvastatin is somewhat hepato-selective but can still get into muscle and give you aches. Even PSK9 inhibitors had some evidence of muscle soreness (even though the mechanism is unclear like it is with statins), although the same is true with placebo. The FDA approved BA (brand name Nexletol) but said a big outcome trial was needed, which the manufacturer is doing. Mendelian analysis has suggested it would work. The FDA let it on the market after a Phase 3 safety trial. (For ezetimibe, Mendelian studies suggested that reducing intestinal absorption of cholesterol would decrease CV events, and that turned out to be correct in outcome trials.) You can add BA to a statin in people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), very high-risk people, or statin-intolerant patients, and/or you can give it with ezetimibe. Trials suggest that BA monotherapy produces 10-18% lowering of LDL (similar to ezetimibe) and a 10-12% decrease in apoB.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Mendelian studies suggest that certain genes are involved with TG and atherosclerosis, so it’s plausible that you could reduce disease if you improve TGs. For a long time, we used lifestyle, niacin, and fibric acid (until they did badly designed trials that concluded fibrates didn’t work because they didn’t give them to any subjects with high TGs). But there has always been an idea that omega-3s could lower TGs. As Bill Harris says, to get lower TGs with omega-3s, you need to use serious doses (not 1 or 2 g). Omega 3s likely have other as yet unknown attributes, as they are a crucial part of cell membranes and signaling. Use maximum dose – about 4000 mg/d – if you want to use omegas to help lower TGs. Trials were done giving 4 g/d to people who had high TGs (many of whom also had low HDL). The first trials were done in Japan about 10 years ago, giving subjects EPA only (we’re not sure why) on top of a stain. The patients did not necessarily have high TGs, but many did. The studies were not blinded but produced evidence that EPA at a high dose (4 g) reduces macrovascular outcomes when given with a statin. Amarin, the company that makes branded EPA (Vascepa), did a major clinical trial called REDUCE IT which enrolled people taking stains to get LDL below 70 (generally high risk people). You had to have TG = 135+ to get into trial; most were around 150. They were maximized on whatever stain they used to get LDL-C under 100. High dose EPA (2 g BID with food) led to almost 30% residual risk reduction. Tom and Bill Harris believed you could also just give 4 g of EPA/DHA. DHA is important too (brain and cell membranes need it), and although most people can convert EPA to DHA, not all can.",

  "content": "Should we use EPA or an EPA/DHA combo? You have to go with EPA 4g/d for those in a high-risk category if you want to be evidence based. What if TG < 150 (say TG = 100) but still residual apoB risk?  Not answerable right now.  Tom is not afraid to keep using combo and is a fan of measuring the Omega-3 index.  If you take 4 g EPA but your index shows adequate DHA, he would know that some of that EPA is being converted and be happy. What if you take 4 g EPA but your index shows inadequate DHA? Then start giving a little DHA too.  Tom doubts that a little DHA is negating EPA, but who knows – maybe it’s true?  We need published data. Peter says the Epanova study did not have enough in common with REDUCE IT to answer that question, but maybe it gives us a clue.  We are doing more EPA trials and sub-analyses now so we will get more information, and we have some angiographic data [published after this podcast was recorded]. Plaque looks a lot better if you are taking 4 g of EPA, which is encouraging.",

They may screw up creatinine levels a bit, but you are improving eGFR (because overproduction of creatinine is not reflective of eGFR). Fenofibric acid, sold as Trilipix, is the purest as it is the only one that isn’t a prodrug. If you have to use one, use Trilipix. A new fibrate is pemafibrate (Parmodia), a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha receptor modulator (SPPARM). There are big outcome trials going on right now, so it won’t be used for a while yet.",
