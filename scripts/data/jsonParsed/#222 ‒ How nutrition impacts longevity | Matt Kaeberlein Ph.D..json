  "content": "Matt thinks we’re conceptually close to testing the role of epigenetic changes in aging in mice. There are these 4 factors called the “Yamanaka factors” that can reprogram the epigenome. If you take cells in culture, in a laboratory and you passage them many, many times you can see changes in the epigenome, just like you might see changes in the epigenome in an animal, in tissues. You can put these reprogramming factors into the cells and turn them on and they basically wipe clean the epigenetic changes that have happened over time. They can restore those cells back to a pluripotent state that can differentiate into any cell type. More recently, people are trying to express these reprogramming factors in an animal. The most compelling work is in a premature aging model of mouse (the progeroid model). These mice are very short lived (maybe 25% of the normal mouse lifespan), very sick. These reprogramming factors can extend the lifespan dramatically, maybe 50%. These are impressive changes that are consistent with the idea that you fixed or made something better. The NEXT experiment would be to express these reprogramming factors in an old mouse and make it young again. Another experiment shows improvement in 1-3 tissues. Matt is most impressed with work from David Sinclair’s lab, where they use this optic degeneration model. They showed they could reverse degeneration of the eye with these factors. They tried to do the same thing in an old mouse but the data was mixed. To some extent they could regenerate the optic nerve in an old mouse.",

Now a calorically-restricted mouse is going to eat its food right away, but if you force them to eat little bits throughout the day you lose a portion of that lifespan benefit. A mouse lives about 3 years. To compare mice to humans, the length of lifespan is not the approach to take when it comes to metabolism. A back of the envelope calculation, its a 1:4 ratio, where 1 day mouse fast might be a 4-5 day fast in people. If you go back to the classic experiments of Rick Weindruch and Roy Walford, those mice are fed a calorically restricted diet, but they’re also fed three times a week (they’re fasting).

It seems intuitive that protein restriction would be beneficial by turning down mTOR. FGF21 is the other important player in protein restriction (particularly total protein restriction). FGF21 is secreted in response to a low protein diet, and then has effects on liver metabolism. It also inhibits mTOR and reduces IGF-1.

It’s so short-acting that the idea of using BCAA analogs to treat sarcopenia was going to require drugs that could stay on much longer. This short-acting signal fits with the concept of homeostasis. Cells and tissues have evolved to maintain metabolites, and amino acid are metabolites. Amino acids are involved in many different metabolic reactions within certain levels. There are all sorts of mechanisms to ensure that if a metabolite it’s outside of that range, we soak it up and we do something else with it. Slightly elevated branched-chain amino acids chronically can have big effects on the sort of downstream processes. There are consequences to even having somewhat modest increases in mTOR, say, hyperactivation of mTOR signaling chronically. So again, the context really matters. It’s Matt’s intuition that it’s probably hard to get very large, persistent increases in mTOR simply from taking a branch chain of amino acid supplement.

The take home message was that low protein is beneficial up to about 65 years of age, and then once you get above 65 years of age, it kind of flips and people who ate a higher protein diet have lower all-cause mortality.

Lifestyles may be very different if you are normal weight and eating high protein, maybe high calorie (because you’re extremely active) than if you’re overweight, sedentary and eating a hot calorie diet. That’s underappreciated and probably really important.",

  "content": "Matt suggests that growth hormone and IGF-1 are primarily acting at the very early steps of cancer where promoting cell division allows mutations to happen and cancers to get a foothold. In most cases, early cancers are detected and wiped out by our immune system. However, the function of the immune system to detect and clear those cancers declines as we get older. A 60-year-old person who is exercising and eating an appropriate diet might be biologically a 40-year-old person and have a much lower total risk of developing cancer because their immune system has a better chance of catching it and getting rid of it.",
