  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The coronary artery calcium score (CAC) is an important step forward in cardiovascular imaging. It uses x-ray techniques to accurately and safely determine whether there’s calcium (bone) in the coronary arteries. Calcification is a feature of advanced atherosclerosis. There’s very strong evidence that people who have coronary calcification are at higher risk of a heart attack or stroke than people who do not have coronary calcification. The frequency of a positive coronary calcium goes up as we age (so does the risk of disease).",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "All American men by age 60 are at high risk according to current guidelines; women are five to 10 years later. At age 60 the CAC test isn’t helpful. In most people arteries become substantially transformed in bad ways by age 60. But in people younger than 60, this can give extra information that is helpful, should the doctor be on the cusp of treatment. This test would be for the patient who wants more information to help them decide about intervention.",

  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There is a problem with the corollary, if the coronary calcium is negative concluding that the patient is okay. Coronary calcification is associated with advanced disease. When people have a heart attack, they don’t just have one little area of their arteries that are abnormal; that’s simply the area where the plaque broke or the endothelium eroded, but the whole artery is diseased. This means there’s a chance of an event a cm down or a cm closer. If a patient has high apoB, the fact that their coronary calcium is negative doesn’t mean they don’t have a lot of disease and that the disease isn’t developing at a rapid rate; it could be there.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There’s an argument saying, if the coronary calcium is negative, nothing’s going to happen to in the next five or 10 years. Maybe this is true; but the disease is developing and doctors can’t make the disease go away. Doctors can modify the effects of the disease, modify the consequences. For a patient who has been treated and their LDL, cholesterol, and apoB levels are brought low, remember that they still have an artery that is destroyed; they’re going to have a substantial number of events.",

  "content": "A 70-year old who has a calcium score of 50 doesn’t tell him much. An older patient with a calcium score of 0 who is adamant about not getting treatment; this is an easier decision to accept. On the flip side of things is a young patient who has a positive calcium score; really that’s a 4-alarm fire. Regardless of apoB, for a patient under 50 who has a speck of calcium in their coronary arteries, that’s utterly unacceptable.",

  "content": "Where Peter finds the most challenge is with the group think that says if a person’s calcium score is zero then no treatment is needed. This gets back to Allan’s paper looking at the 30-year risk and causal model. He mentions briefly at the outset the example of a 45-year-old person for whom their apoB is higher than they should be; their calcium score is expected to be zero and it is; here the calcium score didn’t really add much information to decision-making.",
