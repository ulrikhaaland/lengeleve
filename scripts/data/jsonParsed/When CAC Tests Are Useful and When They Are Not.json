  "content": "The coronary artery calcium score (CAC) is an important step forward in cardiovascular imaging. It uses x-ray techniquest to accurately and safely determine whether there’s calcium (bone) in the coronary arteries. Calcification is a feature of advanced atherosclerosis. There’s very strong evidence that people who have coronary calcification are at higher risk of a heart attack or stroke than people who do not have coronary calcification.",

  "content": "The frequency of a positive coronary calcium goes up as we age (so does the risk of disease). All American men by age 60 are at high risk according to current guidelines; women are five to 10 years later. In most people arteries become substantially transformed in bad ways by age 60. But in people younger than 60, this can give extra information that is helpful, should the doctor be on the cusp of treatment. This test would be for the patient who wants more information to help them decide about intervention.",

  "title": "Problem with the corollary, if the coronary calcium is negative concluding that the patient is okay",
  "date": "April 15, 2022",
  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "From Allan’s interpretation of the literature, coronary calcification is associated with advanced disease. When people have a heart attack, they don’t just have one little area of their arteries that are abnormal; that’s simply the area where the plaque broke or the endothelium eroded, but the whole artery is diseased. This means there’s a chance of an event a cm down or a cm closer. If a patient has high apoB, the fact that their coronary calcium is negative doesn’t mean they don’t have a lot of disease and that the disease isn’t developing at a rapid rate; it could be there. There’s an argument saying, if the coronary calcium is negative, nothing’s going to happen to in the next five or 10 years. Maybe this is true; but the disease is developing and doctors can’t make the disease go away. Doctors can modify the effects of the disease, modify the consequences. For a patient who has been treated and their LDL, cholesterol, and apoB levels are brought low, remember that they still have an artery that is destroyed; they’re going to have a substantial number of events.",

Published in 2021, Novel Lipid-Lowering Therapies to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk. They find that waiting for coronary calcium before starting treatment is a bad idea. Allan is conservative when it comes to protecting patients. He wants to give  them the option to have the best outcome possible when they appear to be in danger. So he wouldn’t use a negative coronary calcium to change his clinical decision for patients who have high apoB or another cause of vascular disease present. He thinks CAC is a good test, but has relatively limited utility for him.",

  "content": "Using the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score as a predictive tool. Peter uses a 2 x 2 matrix to explain this to patients; he considers the patient’s age and CAC score. A 70-year old who has a calcium score of 50 doesn’t tell him much. An older patient with a calcium score of 0 who is adamant about not getting treatment; this is an easier decision to accept. It would be fortunate to have a calcium score of 0 at age 73 with an apoB of 140 mg/dL. On the flip side of things is a young patient who has a positive calcium score; really that’s a 4-alarm fire. Allan agree’s, treating this patient is a no-brainer. Regardless of apoB, for a patient under 50 who has a speck of calcium in their coronary arteries, that’s utterly unacceptable. Allan agrees; if it’s positive, it’s only going to go up.",
