This great study showed that dieting when underslept (6 hrs or less) was much less effective in terms of fat loss.

  "content": "Matthew says that the leading theory of insomnia is that the flight or flight/parasympathetic state of the nervous system is “turned up” too far. In cases of insomnia: Cortisol is down in evening but then right before bed it spikes again (sleep onset insomnia), sometimes spikes again in middle of night and keeping someone from falling back asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia). Walker guesses that if you measured HR variability, looking at contribution of sympathetic vs. parasympathetic systems, you would see sympathetic getting revved up just before sleep onset and then again in middle of night, underlying cortisol spike, which underlies awakening, which underlies insomnia.",

  "content": "Peter says that clinically this very hard to treat. Much easier to treat thyroid or sex hormone dysfunction. Also, easier to treat low sympathetic and low glucocorticoid function rather than the reverse. Hardest problem is high sympathetic and high glucocorticoid output. Behavioral therapy is required: i.e. changes in mindset (meditation) and routine (less stressful activities close to bedtime such as work emails). Phosphatidylserine (400-600 mg): Peter uses this for jet lag circumstances (e.g., must go to bed when it’s only 2 pm in your brain) ⇒ “Phosphatidylserine really seems to move the needle, both in terms of your glucose response and your cortisol response.”",

Peter expresses concern about parents giving sleeping pills to their children, as it may actually be un-wiring their nervous system and memories, rather than strengthening them.",
