The 3 pillars are the 3 disease states that are responsible for the majority of chronic deaths: 1) Atherosclerotic diseases, 2) Cancer, and 3) Neurodegenerative diseases. If the metabolic state of health of an individual is anything other than fully optimized, it is going to increase risk for each and every one of the three pillars of chronic disease. Obesity and type 2 diabetes probably represent the second leading cause of cancer (second only to smoking). And there’s no disputing the relationship that type 2 diabetes has on Alzheimer’s disease and on cardiovascular disease.",

  "content": "Metabolic syndrome is partially defined by having at least 3 of the following 5 things: Elevated waist circumference, Elevated fasting blood sugar, Elevated blood pressure, Elevated triglycerides, and low HDL. A person will sometimes have very high LDL, very high triglycerides and very low HDL. In fact, the condition of metabolic syndrome is partially defined by two of those. Metabolic syndrome that is meant to closely approximate insulin resistance.",

  "content": "Patient C is 0 for 5 on metabolic syndrome and looks to be as insulin sensitive as they come. However, his uric acid is 7.8 and his homocysteine is 12, both signs of inflammation. His fasting insulin at baseline is quite high and at 90 minutes, insulin is still dramatically elevated. This is a guy who metabolically slips through the cracks in most cases.",

  "content": "The goal was to reduce inflammation by correcting homocysteine and insulin levels. It has been stubbornly difficult to correct his homocysteine due to an MTHFR mutation. It took a year to get this patient’s fasting insulin to a normal range. CGM became a very helpful tool for him as well on the behavioral front, because he was struggling with some of the things he was eating.",
