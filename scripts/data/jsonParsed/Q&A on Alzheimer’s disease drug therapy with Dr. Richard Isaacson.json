  "content": "The topic of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  is perpetually on my radar. For many of us, it’s the chronic disease we fear most.  If we can delay the most likely causes of death into old age, cardiovascular diseases and cancer leading the way by a large margin, perhaps we can live a longer life, and perhaps more importantly, we can have a better quality of life. Regardless of the category, if the reward for surviving into older age is an age-related neurodegenerative dementia, the most common being AD, that is a pot of fool’s gold at the end of the rainbow we could all certainly live without. This is not the prototype of a disease that anyone would want in terms of modern medicine. While AD has a few available FDA-approved therapies, these only provide modest symptomatic benefits and are devoid of any disease-modifying effects. Further, there is still no cure on the horizon. Don’t get me wrong. Treatment is critical too, but I would much prefer to prevent disease before it is even necessary to treat disease. For example, I have written about prevention in the context of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). And, as is the case with ASCVD, AD treatment and prevention, specifically, is not so simple. There are a lot of factors that are outside of our control. It is my hope with precision medicine that we can formulate an effective risk reduction protocol before treatment is warranted.",

  "title": "FDA Advisory Panel Decision on Aducanumab",
  "date": "November 22, 2020",
  "context": "Cognitive Health & Neurodegenerative Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "So it caught my attention recently when a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel decision did not support aducanumab—an anti-amyloid antibody AD treatment—for approval. (Recall, beta-amyloid is thought to be a potential causative factor for AD.) Antibody therapies are hypothesized to mitigate and treat cognitive decline by clearing soluble amyloid, thus altering the amyloid balance in the central nervous system (CNS). To put it bluntly, the specifics surrounding the drug’s trial history is anything but simple. Upon a re-analysis of interim data, the drug’s manufacturer, Biogen, resubmitted data from two of its Phase III trials to an FDA advisory committee, in order to evaluate the drug’s effectiveness for approval. The burden of proof is on Biogen to prove that there is sufficient evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of the drug. But ten out of eleven expert advisory committee members did not think there was. This does not mean that the drug was rejected altogether. It is now up to the FDA itself to make the decision in the coming months. It does imply, however, that experts in the field think there is reason enough for pause.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Aducanumab is an anti-amyloid therapy. There was an exciting early trial that showed the drug was effective in reducing amyloid in the brain. There was a suggestion of improvement in cognitive function. Both of these trials were prematurely stopped in March 2019 due to an interim futility analysis. However, when additional longer-term data was analyzed—data not originally included in the interim analysis—it was found that subjects who received the highest dose of Aducanumab for 78 weeks on one of the two trials had about 20% less cognitive decline than placebo.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Aside from just flat-out asking—“is this an effective drug?”—there’s a lot of logistical and operational aspects of aducanumab [utilization]. In this new era of (potentially) disease-modifying therapies, these all need to be considered. The higher dose seems better, but there were also some more side effects. The symptomatic side effects here weren’t really that bad— and they generally resolved over time, but it’s something to consider especially when the drug could potentially become available to millions of people. Another aspect [to consider] is it should only be given to people with amyloid in the brain—and how do you prove that? Order an amyloid brain scan or a spinal tap? Well, those are quite costly and not reimbursed by insurance.",

  "content": "Alzheimer’s starts decades before the first symptom of memory loss begins, and it’s a very heterogeneous disease. Based on my clinical experience—based on seeing thousands of patients across the spectrum of the disease throughout the lifespan—I believe different people can take different roads to AD dementia. If we can figure out what road (or more often, roads) they are on and get them off that path before progressing to dementia, that’s when we can have the highest chance for benefit. We know now that we need to [treat] earlier, which this study did since they focused on the earlier mild cognitive impairment stage. But what is the right target? Is it amyloid [protein] or is it a tau [protein]? Or both? How do you target the amyloid? Is it monomers? Is it something else? Do we need to target people differently based on their genetics? Is there a one-size-fits-all disease modifying therapy out there? I hope so, but is that even feasible (because Alzheimer’s is such a heterogeneous disease)?",

Rachel adds that despite the need for effective treatments, there are certain scientific standards that we would expect to meet for drug approval. All the governing bodies can do is evaluate each treatment trial with the efficacy and safety data at hand, to the best of their ability.",
