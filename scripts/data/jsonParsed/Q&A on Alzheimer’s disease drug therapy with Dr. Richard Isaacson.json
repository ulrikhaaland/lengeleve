  "content": "The topic of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is perpetually on my radar. For many of us, it’s the chronic disease we fear most. I believe that there are measures we can take to delay the chronic diseases that seal one’s fate. If we can delay the most likely causes of death into old age, cardiovascular diseases and cancer leading the way by a large margin, perhaps we can live a longer life, and perhaps more importantly, we can have a better quality of life. Regardless of the category, if the reward for surviving into older age is an age-related neurodegenerative dementia, the most common being AD, that is a pot of fool’s gold at the end of the rainbow we could all certainly live without. This is not the prototype of a disease that anyone would want in terms of modern medicine. While AD has a few available FDA-approved therapies, these only provide modest symptomatic benefits and are devoid of any disease-modifying effects. Further, there is still no cure on the horizon.",

  "content": "So it caught my attention recently when a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel decision did not support aducanumab—an anti-amyloid antibody AD treatment—for approval. Antibody therapies are hypothesized to mitigate and treat cognitive decline by clearing soluble amyloid, thus altering the amyloid balance in the central nervous system (CNS). The burden of proof is on Biogen to prove that there is sufficient evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of the drug. But ten out of eleven expert advisory committee members did not think there was. This does not mean that the drug was rejected altogether. It is now up to the FDA itself to make the decision in the coming months. It does imply, however, that experts in the field think there is reason enough for pause.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "So, currently there are four FDA-approved drugs (with a fifth in combination form) for Alzheimer’s disease. These drugs have been proven by multiple studies and a meta-analysis to be symptomatically effective, and have some impact on activities of daily living, but they have modest effects. They are still the gold standard of care for patients in the mild, moderate, and severe phases of Alzheimer’s disease dementia. While these [approved drugs] are symptomatic therapies they do not have any disease-modifying effects. The rate of failures of drug trials in Alzheimer’s disease is over 99%. We do have a huge pipeline from Phase I through Phase III in terms of clinical trials. Yet in terms of approvals and positive trials, our success rate is minuscule.",

  "context": "Cognitive Health & Neurodegenerative Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Aducanumab is an anti-amyloid therapy. There was an exciting early trial that showed the drug was effective in reducing amyloid in the brain. There was a suggestion of improvement in cognitive function. However, both of these trials were prematurely stopped in March 2019 due to an interim futility analysis. However, when additional longer-term data was analyzed—data not originally included in the interim analysis—it was found that subjects who received the highest dose of Aducanumab for 78 weeks on one of the two trials had about 20% less cognitive decline than placebo. That being said, analysis of the other trial was still negative. Further complicating the issue, subjects in the highest dose group of that [negative] study had somewhat worse cognitive decline than placebo.",

  "content": "The future of Alzheimer’s disease is to treat earlier in the disease course and individualize care based on emerging concepts of precision medicine. If people can take different roads to Alzheimer’s disease, but, in the end, pathways are amyloid and tau, we likely need to target everything to be in the best position for success. I think we need to be open-minded and realize that there may not be a single magic bullet to prevent or cure Alzheimer’s. We may need multiple different approaches. It’s like, for a war you need: the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard, the Special Forces, the Space Force. You need everybody to be the most well-suited for battle, and I think it’s the same for Alzheimer’s. Just like in diabetes treatment and prevention, you have your lifestyle changes, your dietary changes, your different drugs that work on different pathways. For high blood pressure, high cholesterol—any chronic disease associated with aging—you need multiple different targets and multiple interventions across the lifespan before there’s [apparent] pathology.",

  "content": "It’s also important to say that the FDA has not yet made a judgment on this medication. This was an expert advisory panel. This was not the FDA. The FDA was supportive—in fact, the clinical team of the FDA was enthusiastically supportive, but the FDA statistical team was not. So this is a very unique situation where you have patient advocacy organizations and one clinical member of the FDA that are very positive and then you have independent experts and an FDA statistician that don’t feel the same way. It is a unique and complicated situation [that is] now in the hands of the FDA. Regardless of the outcome, this is a watershed moment in the field of Alzheimer’s disease therapeutics. It’s something we need to learn from, and whatever happens, keep pushing forward.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Here’s a closing thought, which Richard alluded to above: despite the need for effective treatments, and with respect to Alzheimer’s disease specifically, there’s still a very specific standard that scientists look for in the way of data quality. But especially recently, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has, in a lot of ways, acted differently. They’ve changed their modus operandi and I think it’s hard to predict how the FDA of the past will act compared to the FDA of the future. Alzheimer’s disease is a unique disease but there are certain scientific standards that we would expect to meet for drug approval. But amid such uncertainty, it is difficult to predict the outcome. We will have to continue to turn to and trust the scientific process—which necessitates allowing for uncertainty. All the governing bodies can do is evaluate each treatment trial with the efficacy and safety data at hand, to the best of their ability.",
