  "content": "Our mind is like a boardroom where we're projecting stuff on a screen, and that's our conscious awareness. These projections are done by our sub-minds. We have an audio sub-mind, a visual sub-mind, and a narrating sub-mind that ties them together. The liberating thing about this is that at any moment your next slice could be something completely different. Itâ€™s influenced by the momentum of the previous slices, but it is in itself an unknown and anything is possible.",
