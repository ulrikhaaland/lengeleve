  "content": "Our mind is really like a boardroom where you’re projecting stuff on a screen, and that’s our conscious awareness. These sub-minds are what’s doing the projecting. We have an audio sub-mind, a visual sub-mind, and a narrating sub-mind that ties them together. The liberating thing about that is that at any moment your next slice could be something completely different. It’s influenced by the momentum of the previous slices, but it is in itself an unknown and anything is possible.",
