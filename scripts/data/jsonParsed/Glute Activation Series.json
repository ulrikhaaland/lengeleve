  "content": "The extensive focus here is getting the glute max and glute med fired up and ready to work. If you care about not being in pain, and not being injured, this is for you. I do this as part of my broader workout prep routine at least 3 times per week. It’s making a huge difference, but it takes time to get these right. One of the biggest mistakes we make, courtesy of all the sitting we do, is we fail to fire or load our glutes when we hip hinge. Furthermore, even when we are strong on a front-to-back plane of motion, we tend to lack side-to-side (lateral) stability, which the glute med plays an important role in providing.",

  "content": "The Bridge, which has 4 parts, will fire up your glutes. You should NOT feel like you’re arching your lower back. Keep your heels in line with hips. Both hips at the same level, one should not be higher than the other. Core should stay engaged. You should feel this in your glutes >>> hamstrings (and not at all in your lumbar spine).",

  "content": "The aptly-named ‘Jane Fonda’ exercise puts the tension mainly in the gluteus medius. Heel out as far as possible (i.e., hips fully extended). Toes pointing down. Careful not to load the lumbar spine. If you feel this in your lateral quads (VLO), you are doing it incorrectly.",

Elbow on the ground should be in direct line with shoulder. Engaged in your mid-back. Lifted knee should be in line with hip.",

Note: Do not start with this until you can “easily” do 10 reps of the standard shark bite *correctly*. Also, this is really unnecessary on a day when you will do significant glute work, given how much it will fatigue you. Instead, use this on days when you are not able to do more formal hip hinging.",
