  "content": "The Bridge, which has 4 parts, will fire up your glutes. Key reminders: You should NOT feel like you’re arching your lower back. Keep your heels in line with hips. Both hips at the same level, one should not be higher than the other. “Core” (in scare quotes because core doesn’t really mean much, per se, and actually refers to the pelvic floor, transversalis fascia, etc, but we’ll cover that in more detail later) should stay engaged. You should feel this in your glutes >>> hamstrings (and not at all in your lumbar spine).",

  "content": "The aptly-named ‘Jane Fonda’ exercise puts the tension mainly in the gluteus medius. Credit for this exercise goes to speed guru Ryan Flaherty. Key reminders: Heel out as far as possible (i.e., hips fully extended). Toes pointing down. Careful not to load the lumbar spine. If you feel this in your lateral quads (VLO), you are doing it incorrectly.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "This sequence is the link between the floor work and the standing work (in technical parlance, the link between “open chain” and “closed chain”). Very important for me to “feel” that I can lunge and squat without loading the lumbar spine and that I can “feel” my glutes/hamstrings doing the work, and keep my hips back. Key reminders: For squat portion: Pretty narrow stance—feet under your shoulders (not wide like a power squatter). Avoid a knee valgus (knees collapsing inward as you squat). Knees should be over ball of foot and never in front of toes. For lunge portion: Lumbar spine stays neutral throughout the movement, which means there should no flaring of the ribs. Shorter and narrower stance than you initially find comfortable. Rear heel straight up. Same caveat for front knee in relation to front foot. Sink straight down so that you’re eccentrically loading your quads in rear leg and glute in front leg—if you do this exercise correctly, even without much weight, you will likely fail in the front glute.",

  "content": "My all-time favorite, I called this “The Shark Bite” after Carla started me on it in early 2018 when I imagined this was what it might feel like to have a shark bite my glutes. If you do this correctly, your glutes are screaming by rep 10. This is the starter version. Key reminders: Spine is neutral, Hips level when bent forward (the tendency is to have non-planted hip rise—fight the urge), Avoid knee valgus on the planted leg, Keep “core” (same quotes and caveat as above) engaged throughout all the moving and bending, Sink straight down when going into lunge and curtsy, with torso upright (the tendency is to lean forward in the curtsy)",

  "content": "This is the more advanced “Shark Bite” for those masochists out there. This takes the basic version to a new level of glute activation. Note: Do not start with this until you can “easily” do 10 reps of the standard shark bite *correctly*. Also, this is really unnecessary on a day when you will do significant glute work, given how much it will fatigue you. Instead, use this on days when you are not able to do more formal hip hinging. Key reminders: Always sink straight down when going into lunge and curtsy, as it’s especially easy to lean forward with the dumbbells in your hands, You should feel this is on your glute and hamstring and not the tendons behind your knees",
