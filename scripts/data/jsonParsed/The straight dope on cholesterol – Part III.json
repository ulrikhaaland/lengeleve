  "content": "Cholesterol is an organic molecule in our body. We eat it, we make it, we store it, and we excrete it. The pool of cholesterol in our body is essential for life. Cholesterol exists in 2 forms – unesterified or 'free' and esterified. Much of the cholesterol we eat is in the form of esterified cholesterol. It is not absorbed and is excreted by our gut. The cholesterol we synthesize in our body is the dominant source of the cholesterol in our body. The process of regulating cholesterol is very complex and multifaceted with multiple layers of control. Eating cholesterol has very little impact on the cholesterol levels in your body.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Cholesterol and triglycerides are not soluble in plasma and are therefore said to be hydrophobic. To be carried anywhere in our body, they need to be carried by a special protein-wrapped transport vessel called a lipoprotein. As these lipoproteins leave the liver they undergo a process of maturation where they shed much of their triglyceride 'cargo' in the form of free fatty acid, and doing so makes them smaller and richer in cholesterol. Special proteins, apoproteins, play an important role in moving lipoproteins around the body and facilitating their interactions with other cells.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "When you go to your doctor to have your cholesterol levels checked, what they actually do is measure serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and sometimes non-HDL-C. Blood is drawn into a tube and immediately spun in centrifuge to separate the blood from 'whole blood' into serum and blood cells. As early as the 1950's scientists figured out clever chemical tricks to directly measure the content of total cholesterol in the serum.",

  "title": "Understanding LDL Particles",
  "date": "May 10, 2012",
  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The apoB particles have the potential to deliver cholesterol into an artery wall, and 90-95% of the apoB particles are LDL particles. Hence, it is LDL particle number that drives the particles into the artery wall. Thus, physicians need to be able to quantify the number of LDL particles present in a given individual. For a long time it was not possible to directly measure LDL-C, the cholesterol content of an LDL particle. However, we did know the following had to be true: TC = LDL-C + HDL-C + VLDL-C + IDL-C + chylomicron-C + remnant-C + Lp(a)-C.",

  "context": "Cardiovascular Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A breakthrough formula, called the Friedewald Formula, estimates VLDL-C as one-fifth the concentration of serum triglycerides. This assumes all TG are trafficked in one’s VLDL particles and that a normally composed VLDL contains five times more TG than cholesterol. LDL-C can be estimated knowing just TC, HDL-C, and TG. However, if the LDL particle is cholesterol-depleted instead of its normal state of being cholesterol-enriched, using this formula can significantly underestimate LDL-C.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Many companies have developed proprietary techniques to measure LDL-C directly, along with apoB, and ultimately LDL-P. Atherotech developed an assay, called a VAP panel, to directly measure the amount of cholesterol contained within the LDL particle. They have developed assays to directly measure the cholesterol in IDL particles, VLDL particles, and even Lp(a) particles. Subparticle cholesterol content information is also generated, including 2 different classes of HDL particles and 4 different classes of LDL particles.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There are several methods of counting LDL and HDL particles, but only one company, LipoScience, has the FDA approved technology to do so using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or NMR for short. In addition to counting the actual total number of LDL particles and HDL particles per liter, HDL, Inc. directly measures apoB and apoA-I. Furthermore, the size of each particle is measured using NMR in nanometers.",

  "content": "The presence of increased large VLDL-P, large VLDL size, increased small LDL- P, small LDL size, reduced large HDL-P, small HDL size are early markers for insulin resistance, and such findings may actually precede more conventional signs of insulin resistance by several years. The number and size of the lipoprotein particles is perhaps the earliest warning sign for insulin resistance.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The measurement of cholesterol has undergone a dramatic evolution over the past 70 years with technology at the heart of the advance. Currently, most people undergo a “standard” lipid panel which only directly measures TC, TG, and HDL-C. LDL-C can be measured directly, but is most often estimated. More advanced cholesterol measuring tests do exist to directly measure LDL-C, along with the cholesterol content of other lipoproteins or lipoprotein subparticles. The most frequently used and guideline recommended test that can count the number of particles is the NMR LipoProfile.",
