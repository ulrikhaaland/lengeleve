  "content": "This episode will focus on the life story of the life story of Otto Warburg. He grew up in Germany before World War II and was influenced by some of the most influential German scientists. Discussion will focus on his seminal work prior to the second World War and the odd manner in which he was able to remain in Germany unharmed during the second World War despite being both Jewish and gay. Much of his work would be largely forgotten by the time he died in 1970. It would only be about 30 years later that some of his observations would come back to be relevant within the field of cancer biology. It’s still not entirely clear if his hypothesis around that observation is correct. Peter does not personally think it was. But nevertheless, this makes for an interesting discussion.",

  "content": "Sam's interest in metabolism began when he read the work of Taubes. Gary Taubes was a recent guest of this podcast. Sam had been interested in metabolism for a number of years but didn’t think of cancer as a metabolic disease or as being lumped together with with obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. As he read more he began to see that these diseases clustered together and appear in the same pattern beginning in the 19th century; this sparked his curiosity. Sam remarked that as he read about Otto Warburg “it was kind of a light bulb moment for me… I knew I was going to write about it [Warburg] and I knew I had a way to tell the story”. His father was a writer, though he mostly wrote fiction. He didn’t choose to follow in his father’s footsteps exactly. He wasn’t sure what his career path would be in college, but he received a lot of praise for his writing. Praise led him to see that writing was his strength; he enjoyed doing it and was good at it.",

  "content": "Being a good writer is a combination of innate ability and always seeking to improve. He doesn’t think good writing is correlated strongly with intelligence. The ability to use language in a certain way comes naturally to some people and not others. For some, this ability can be developed with enough practice. Sam teaches writing and science writing at John Hopkins. Reading just a paragraph of a student’s writing can tell him what kind of feel they have for language. Even 3-4 sentences is enough to reveal a student’s grasp of language and writing. He looks for extra words in sentences, tight logic, flow. Sam thinks good writing comes down to clarity. When reading good writing, one can grasp it right away because the language is concise and clear. If writing has to be read 2-3 times to grasp the meaning, then it’s not very good. Revision is also essential for good writing. Sam notes that “everything that I write comes out pretty poorly in the first draft, even my emails; if I really care about an email, I spend a lot of time just going over and over and over it because it’s the repetition, it’s correction after correction after correction where the writing starts to improve”.",

  "content": "Otto Warburg’s childhood and inspiration to pursue science. He was born into pretty well-to-do German family in the latter third of the 19th century. His father was Emil Warburg, a very prominent physicist in Germany who worked at the University of Berlin despite being Jewish. At the beginning of World War I, Warburg was in his early 30s. The impact of the war was pretty remarkable on German scientists. Many scientists were Jewish. Many scientists were ready to go and fight on the front lines. Many signed up for the war effort to prove they were full Germans. Warburg went to the battlefield while others worked with Fritz Haber, who developed chemical warfare. Warburg loved horses and joined a cavalry regiment. His parents were desperate for him to come home and have Einstein write a letter to him. Einstein appeals to Warburgs narcissism and wrote “You’re just too important for science. We can’t afford to lose you.” Not long after, Warburg returns home; the letter from Einstein likely saves his life. 5 years later Warburg makes his great breakthrough about cancer and fermentation. Science was like a religious devotion for him. He was like a prophet who has this fervor; he thought of nothing but science.",

Photosynthesis is working pretty well.” Warburg wants to make a world-changing discovery and cancer had become a German obsession by the 1920’s. In the early 19th century there’s not much cancer. Cancer rates really increased in the 1920’s and 1930’s. There is a panic because so many people are getting cancer. The rates then still pale in comparison to today’s rates. In this context, it seemed natural that scientists would figure out and cure cancer. As Warburg studies cancer he discovers that cancer cells eat differently than other cells. Cancer cells ferment glucose rather than breaking it down and burning with oxygen (oxidative phosphorylation).",

Hitler also idolized Robert Koch and this idea of causality. He referred to himself as the “Robert Koch of politics”.

This was the context where Warburg said “every disease has a prime cause and a secondary cause”. He used the analogy of Robert Koch that the prime cause of infectious disease is a microbe. There are all sorts of secondary causes: unsanitary conditions that allow a microbe to get into a person, plagues, anything that causes a microbe to get into a person’s blood.",

Other reasons cells may take up a lot of glucose is to synthesize new nucleotides, lipids, etc for daughter cells; this is argued as the main reason for taking up so much glucose. Thus cancer cells prioritize metabolic pathways for proliferation rather than efficient production of ATP. Most scientists now agree with this explanation.

  "content": "The primary cause of cancer is the first step in the process, while the secondary cause is what permits the primary cause to occur. Smoking and obesity are the two most readily identified epidemiologic factors in terms of most people impacted in the developed world. Insulin is a growth factor associated with obesity and is a prime candidate within the obesity paradigm for driving cancer.",

  "content": "The connection between obesity and cancer is not casual. Instead, hyperinsulinemia is simultaneously driving obesity and cancer cell proliferation. Some people are ‘metabolically healthy’ and obese; they store more nutrients in subcutaneous fat and not visceral fat. Conversely, some thin people have insulin resistance. These questions matter a lot in terms of cancer prevention.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There’s new research coming about how nutrients play a huge role in epigenetics as well. It may be that there’s just bad luck and mutation comes along, and then if the insulin is there, the cell takes advantage… if it’s not then the tumor never takes off. A lot of people die with cancer rather than from cancer. Maybe the immune system can kill microscopic tumors if not for the insulin. If not for the insulin telling cancer cells to stay alive. Epidemiology says there is something going on with nutrition; cancer was much more rare prior to the shift to the Western diet. Sam thinks it all points to hyperinsulinemia. It’s a growth factor and cancer cells are covered in insulin receptors. The counterpoint is that bad luck produces a mutation in AKT, then the cell no longer needs insulin and can just get all the glucose at once. But as he understands it, even with mutations in the PI3K, AKT, mTOR pathway, they’re still insulin-dependent, just less dependent.",

  "title": "Fructose and Cancer",
  "date": "December 13, 2021",
  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Rick Johnson and Lew Cantley have both spoken about non-insulin requiring nutrients such as fructose. Recent work by Cantley’s lab and Richard Johnson’s lab showed that fructose seems to drive certain cancers. Particularly colon cancer. Fructose turns on the Warburg effect, allows ATP to go down, and allows glucose to flow in. This occurs independently of the effect of insulin. Peter points out that when fructose is consumed in excess, fructose metabolism leads to insulin resistance, which leads to hyperinsulinemia. The Colon cancer work by Lew Cantley suggests that it’s an energetic issue, the lowering of ATP in the cell that occurs when fructose is metabolized that can drive hyper-influx of glucose. Sam found Rick Johnson’s whole discussion of the role of fructose absolutely fascinating. Johnson discussed fructose with Peter in this podcast from January 2020. His example of the naked mole-rats was fascinating. They live in a low-oxygen environment and run a lot of Warburg metabolism by converting glucose to fructose.",

  "title": "Reflections on Writing Ravenous",
  "date": "December 13, 2021",
  "context": "Preventing Chronic Disease",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Sam’s reflections on the work that went into Ravenous. Sam grew up Jewish; he learned about the Holocause and Nazis. In his mind they were monsters; he never humanized them. In researching this book, he had to look at the personal stories of all the Nazis and not think of them in an abstract, evil way but understand them as human beings. Understand how they went down this path; how it happened progressively. How someone who might in one context be a nice friend and neighbor, go on to work on documents that lead to the murder of millions. It was chilling and eye-opening to think that this wasn’t an anomaly, but this had happened elsewhere and could happen again in various forms. It made him more politically attuned to certain extremist politics. The book was a daunting project; it has 120,000-some words. He didn’t speak German fluently and didn’t plan to write the book. The publisher came to him after his article in the New York Times Magazine and asked him to write it. Through the process of writing Ravenous, he learned a lot about himself as a writer and trust himself more as a historian. Writing it was a big risk but the end of the project was very rewarding.",
