He was always interested in energy and wanted to understand biology through an understanding of energy. Warburg was dedicated to his science, viewing it as a religious devotion. He believed that a scientist should be prepared to die for the truth. Warburg was also a great narcissist, which often led to feuds with other scientists. Despite being Jewish and homosexual in a time and place where both were stigmatized, Warburg managed to focus on his work and make significant contributions to the field of science.",

  "content": "Warburg was always interested in cancer. He noticed that cancer rates really increased in the 1920s and 1930s, which led to a panic as so many people were getting cancer. As Warburg studied cancer, he discovered that cancer cells eat differently than other cells. Cancer cells ferment glucose rather than breaking it down and burning with oxygen (oxidative phosphorylation). This discovery about the shift to fermentation in cancer cells was a remarkable discovery and ended up occupying much of his life.",

This is the context when the Nazis were worrying about Warburg; the meeting was even in Himmler’s day planner. In Goebbels’ diary, he records hours before the Operation Barbarossa that he and Hitler were talking about cancer research. It doesn’t mention Warburg’s name but it seems Hitler knew what was going on. There is evidence of Hitler’s direct involvement because Warburg applied for a German Blood Certificate. This is a document for someone with partial Jewish heritage declaring them of German blood. Hitler reviewed these applications. He probably decided on June 21, 1941 to approve his application and let Warburg continue to focus on cancer. Warburg gets the papers he needs to continue living and working in Germany.",

This enzyme is now called cytochrome oxidase (complex IV of the electron transport chain). The whole time Warburg had been saying this [reaction with oxygen] was the only thing one needed to know for respiration. This was analogous to what he said about cancer, that the switch to fermentation was all one needed to know. He finally accepted that respiration and what happens at the electron transport chain is actually a multi-step process, outlined in the figure below. Respiration doesn’t just occur directly with oxygen, but hydrogens are ripped off nutrients and passed down the electron transport chain to oxygen at the end. He then became interested in hydrogen transfers in respiration and understanding how the reaction takes place. This is his focus in the 40’s. Many people think this is the best science he did. He made huge advances in understanding the role of coenzymes and how they react with hydrogen and allow for these transfers. This was innovative work that set the stage for decades of enzyme research. This led to the discovery of NAD among other things. He deserved another Nobel prize for this work but Sam didn’t find any evidence that he was in the running to get one.",

  "content": "Warburg studied the electron transport chain and the movement of electrons and hydrogen back and forth between NAD and NADH. Warburg’s earlier work had focused on indirect evidence using lights at different wavelengths to identify enzymes. This technique generates a fingerprint of cells. Light patterns are used to identify cellular enzymes. In the ‘30’s he’s trying to isolate enzymes and perform chemical analysis to determine the reactive components. He was working on what he called the “in-between ferment”, which we now know as NAD. He can only isolate a small amount from horse blood, not enough for chemical analysis. At one point he says “To figure this out, I’m going to need to kill all the horses in Germany”. He asks a friend who worked in the chemical industry in Germany to see if he can find anything similar to NAD; this friend finds an exact match, nicotinic acid (niacin). This is a chemical that had been used in photography for decades. Warburg remarks, “Wherever I’m sitting, a day ago, I couldn’t buy it for all the money in the world; and now, I can get it for two marks.” Nicotinic acid turned out to be hugely important, not only for understanding respiration but for understanding the disease Pellagra. Pellagra was solved after Warburg made this discovery and someone thought to give nicotinic acid to people with this disease to see if it cured them; it did. Warburg wanted to make a great discovery and save lives; he actually did, but he never saw it that way.",

By the nineties, students don’t know his name.” – Sam Apple. Warburg dies in 1970. In the year 2000, Robert Weinberg co-authors a paper on the six fundamental traits of cancer and doesn’t include the Warburg effect or mentioned Warburg or metabolism. They publish a revised review of the hallmarks of cancer in 2011 and include Warburgs work on altered metabolism. By in large, Warburg is gone from cancer science, gone from textbooks.

Both were working on understanding cancer molecular biology and tracing signaling pathways in the cell and working their way back to metabolic enzymes. They found that the transcription factor, MYC, was activating lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This pathway leading back to a basic fermentation reaction launched a lot of the metabolism revival.",

This paper argues that there is not evidence for defective respiration; the mitochondria seem functional and intact. Other reasons cells may take up a lot of glucose is to synthesize new nucleotides, lipids, etc for daughter cells; this is argued as the main reason for taking up so much glucose. Thus cancer cells prioritize metabolic pathways for proliferation rather than efficient production of ATP. Most scientists now agree with this explanation.",

Peter’s view, thinking on first principles, is that the Warburg effect doesn’t make sense. If the primary cause of cancer is damage to the mitochondria, that is an insult to the cell that inhibits its ability to acquire energy. It’s great that the cell can produce energy outside of the mitochondria. An insult to the mitochondria doesn’t explain why the cell would then take up more nutrients; instead it explains why the cell would metabolize nutrients in a different way.",
