However, the study only tells us that younger men and men who donâ€™t smoke are less likely to develop heart disease during the next 10 years, and does not directly link push-up prowess to CVD risk.",

  "content": "The New York Times published articles on the supposed risks of eating deli meats and processed meats, citing a 2011 meta-analysis and a recent meta-analysis on breast cancer risk, respectively. However, the author notes that the studies are observational and cannot establish causation, and that the associations are weak and confounded by other factors. The author also points out that the studies have been criticized for their flaws.",
