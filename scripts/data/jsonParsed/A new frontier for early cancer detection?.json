The 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is about 92% if diagnosed before it has spread to lymph nodes (stage I) compared to about 9% if diagnosed once it has spread to distant organs (stage IV).",

  "content": "The GRAIL blood test is a type of liquid biopsy, aimed to detect whether or not a person has cancer somewhere in the body when there are still very few cancer cells. The test uses cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments to detect up to 50 types of cancer and is able to determine the tumor organ of origin with near 90% accuracy.",

  "content": "The GRAIL blood test produces a readout that essentially says cancer either has or hasn’t been detected. The test sensitivity was 55% and the test specificity was 99%. So of the blood samples that had cancer, the test correctly identified 55 for every 100 of those samples as having cancer. And of the blood samples that did not have cancer, the test correctly identified 99 for every 100 samples as not having cancer.",

  "content": "One of the most significant caveats of the preliminary GRAIL test results is that the trial conditions did not mirror real-world cancer occurrence. The trial used blood samples that had about a 50 times higher rate of cancer than one would see in the real-world. As a result, the test’s ability to correctly identify cancer, the test’s positive predictive value, was overstated.",

  "content": "Another consideration for the test’s real-world value is how well it can identify cancer early. While the test correctly identified cancer in 55% of samples that were truly cancerous at any stage (including stage IV), test sensitivity was not as high for positive samples in earlier cancer stages. The GRAIL test sensitivity increased in a cancer-stage dependent manner: about 20% for stage I cancers, about 45% for stage II cancers, about 81% for stage III cancers, and about 93% for stage IV cancers.",

  "content": "Liquid biopsy tests and other kinds of cutting-edge cancer detection tests need to be evaluated in real-world prospective trials to know how accurate they are. There is no one-test panacea. The potential utility of liquid biopsies are exciting when they can be stacked and utilized with other cancer screening approaches, using each for their strengths and complementing one another where there are weaknesses. Various exams, such as low-dose chest CTs (for former smokers) and a special kind of full-body MRIs, are used. A layered screening approach is important to know where the blindspots are. For example, liquid biopsies are not great tests for encapsulated tissues like the prostate, but there are other kinds of diagnostic tests like the 4K score and multiparametric MRI. Despite its inherent limitations for certain kinds of cancers, the GRAIL test’s sensitivity is expected to improve in future trials because it works like any good algorithm would, improving the more chances it has to learn. Once the GRAIL test can be widely distributed, it is believed it will prove to be a scalable tool to aid early cancer screening in the general public.",
