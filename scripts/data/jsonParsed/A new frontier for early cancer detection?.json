  "content": "Beyond prevention, early detection is the only truly effective approach for reducing mortality from cancer (at least for now). That is why I am particularly interested in a new early detection blood test, created by the diagnostics company GRAIL. The GRAIL blood test is a type of liquid biopsy, aimed to detect whether or not a person has cancer somewhere in the body when there are still very few cancer cells. Liquid biopsies have been around for a number of years and have generated a lot of excitement, but the GRAIL test stands out because its cornerstone technology uses machine learning to analyze blood samples for cancer signatures. The test uses something called cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments to detect up to 50 types of cancer and is able to determine the tumor organ of origin with near 90% accuracy.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Even though GRAIL uses promising technology, there are still questions about the real-world utility of the GRAIL test for early cancer detection. The GRAIL liquid biopsy validation trial used blood bank samples, from which the algorithm could learn patterns and the test results could be compared to the true blood sample status (i.e., cancerous or not). In the GRAIL test, the test sensitivity was 55% and the test specificity was 99%. So of the blood samples that had cancer, the test correctly identified 55 for every 100 of those samples as having cancer. And of the blood samples that did not have cancer, the test correctly identified 99 for every 100 samples as not having cancer.",

  "content": "The trial used blood samples that had about a 50 times higher rate of cancer than one would see in the real-world (52% cancer rate in blood bank samples vs about 1% cancer rate in the real-world). As a result, the test’s ability to correctly identify cancer, the test’s positive predictive value, was overstated.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "While the test correctly identified cancer in 55% of samples that were truly cancerous at any stage (including stage IV), test sensitivity was not as high for positive samples in earlier cancer stages. Indeed, the GRAIL test sensitivity increased in a cancer-stage dependent manner: about 20% for stage I cancers, about 45% for stage II cancers, about 81% for stage III cancers, and about 93% for stage IV cancers. In the test validation results, the test’s sensitivity for all local cancers (stages I, II, and III) was about 44%, which means that it missed 56% of true cancer cases.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "In my practice, I use various exams, such as low-dose chest CTs (for former smokers) and a special kind of full-body MRIs, which I discuss in my conversation with Rajpaul Attariwala. What is important about a layered screening approach is to know where the blindspots are. In other words, what are the weaknesses for a given test to know what could be potentially missed? For example, liquid biopsies are not great tests for encapsulated tissues like the prostate, but we have other kinds of diagnostic tests like the 4K score and multiparametric MRI, which I discuss in my conversation with renowned urologist Ted Schaeffer.",

There may not be a single player (or cancer screening technology) that can do it all, but a good team can be made complete by complimentary players.",

  "content": "Despite its inherent limitations for certain kinds of cancers, I think that the GRAIL test’s sensitivity will only improve in future trials because it works like any good algorithm would, improving the more chances it has to learn. Once the GRAIL test can be widely distributed, I believe it will prove to be a scalable tool to aid early cancer screening in the general public.",
