Aerobic means ATP demand is slow enough that it can be met through mitochondrial oxidation of fuel sources (fatty acids). Anaerobic energy demands exceed the capacity of mitochondria oxidation. The creatine phosphate system (also called the phosphagen system) is the fastest way to resynthesize ATP in the muscle. Even under aerobic conditions, cell metabolism can produce lactate. Aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) also produces lactate. ATP can also be produced in the cytosol of a cell without mitochondrial oxidation.

Without added fuel source, the injured body doesn’t have enough energy to repair itself. In his research on lactate, Brooks has discovered three main uses of lactate in the body.

Even though a normal athletes Fatox increases after one to two weeks of CHO restriction, their power output decreases. Ketogenic diets may allow the body to be more metabolically flexible (with carbohydrate consumption) long term, but elite athletes cannot afford to wait for adaptation (takes months to years).",

Could also be that mitochondrial decrease in overall function via inhibition of Complex II.

Meyerhof, under Warburg, discovered glycolysis which was measured prior to discovery via lactate produced by the cell. Observed that cancer cells have a very high lactate production. Three possible explanations for the role of lactate in cancer metabolism… Dysfunctional mitochondria (Warburg), Glycolysis and lactate production is a byproduct of metabolic demand via rate of cell growth (put forth by Craig Thomson, Lewis Cantley, and Mathew Vander Heiden in their 2009 paper), Cancer relies on lactate as a signalling molecule (Millán and Brooks aforementioned study awaiting publication).",
