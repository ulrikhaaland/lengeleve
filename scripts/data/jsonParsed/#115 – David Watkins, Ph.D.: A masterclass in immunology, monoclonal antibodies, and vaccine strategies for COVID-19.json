  "content": "B cells—How they fight viruses, create antibodies, and fit into the vaccine strategy [25:00]. Defining attenuated virus and vaccines. The best vaccines are often using attenuated (weakened) versions of the original virus. Some drawbacks of attenuated viruses: Some people’s immune responses can not handle the attenuated virus (usually older people). 1 in 300,000, will get sick from the virus and some of them will die. When studying immune responses to the 17D yellow fever vaccine… All the vaccinated individuals make “beautiful” neutralizing antibody responses against 17D yellow fever. Even if you dilute their serum to 1 in 5,000, it will still stop the virus from infecting cells. However, there’s a large range in the ability of the people that were vaccinated to respond to the wild-type virus. For example, when they took the virus out of a dead monkey that died of yellow fever… A few individuals didn’t make any responses against the wild-type primary islet because these viruses that come right out of a monkey, for example, are incredibly well adapted to replicating in the monkey and have not been adapted to replicate in tissue culture. And this primary islet is incredibly important to test any vaccine against. Summary of how B cells work against a virus: The B cells arrive pretty soon after that innate response takes place. Next, they go through an evolutionary replicative cycle until they converge on the perfect antigen. The antibodies eventually reach affinity matured—meaning they get better and better at binding to the piece of virus that they attach to. This occurs in the lymph nodes where the architecture is very important because you’ve got T cells that are absolutely necessary to help them develop in those lymph nodes. Then they exit the lymph nodes about 7 to 14 days later, and then they become either: a) Memory B cells—which are very small B cells that circulate, or b) Plasma cells—big cells in the bone marrow which essentially become the factories of antibodies. If one of those plasma cells is making considerable amounts of neutralizing antibodies, you will be protected from an infection with that virus that you’ve just seen for a long time. *Note*: That will vary from virus to virus, but that’s essentially the ontogeny and evolution of the B cell response.",

  "content": "A T cell kills a virus with a completely different method than B cells. Once a virus enters a cell, it will make thousands of copies of itself and released them into the blood. An antibody (from a B cell) can stop the virus from getting into the cell (that’s proven difficult to do with HIV). But once that virus is in the cell, the antibody cannot do anything. This is where a T cell comes into the picture. An infected cell is like a virus factory—and you need to shut that virus factory down. What we need is a cell that can recognize an infected cell and kill it before it releases all the progeny virus. And it has to be able to recognize an infected from an uninfected cell. And that is what a CD8 T cell does in a very elegant way. When the virus binds to the receptor and gets into the cell, it starts to make its own proteins in that cell. Then we have these “buckets” called major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHC). These buckets sample what’s on the inside of the cell, and they put it up on the surface of the cell. And in the buckets on the cell’s surface are pieces of the virus in an infected cell. So a killer T cell will come along and it will looks for non normal cells. If it finds one, It binds to that and it blows holes in that infected cell to close the factory down. So these MHC buckets are like “flags” on the surface of an infected cell that say, “kill me”. A CD8 T cell plays a critically important role in almost any viral infection.",

For HIV, the first attempt was to make neutralizing antibodies by vaccination, but it’s very difficult to make a neutralizing antibody against HIV and SIV (primate equivalent of HIV). When someone is infected with HIV (or a monkey with SIV)…. Problem 1: Huge population of the virus with enormous variability in the virus. 10 to 100 million copies of virus per ML in those first few weeks. Almost all of them are different. So when you talk about HIV, you’re basically talking about lots of different HIV. Problem 2: We’ve been unable to generate by vaccination a neutralizing antibody against HIV. For example, you can vaccinate monkeys for SIV and generate huge levels of antibodies that bind but none of them seem to neutralize the virus. And that’s due to the biology of the virus. There are very few copies of envelope on the surface of a HIV variant. That envelope is a protein, but it’s covered in a shield of sugars making it hard to get in and to bind to the regions of the envelope that are important for binding the CD4 and getting into the cell.",

Within a span of about two years, HIV went from uniformly fatal to a chronic disease where people can live with T-cell counts that would’ve rendered them dead within months in the past. In other words, the HIV epidemic was stopped without a vaccine. Ron Desrosiers of the New England Primate Center, isolated a virus that looked very similar to HIV (SIV) which became animal model that we are able to test therapies on. Next came the behavioral method to slow the transmission,  using condoms. For coronavirus, that means social distancing. Next came a repurposed drug called AZT. This brought virus loads down but they would come back up because the virus’s ability to escape. Then Ray Schinazi discovered that a combination drugs was an effective treatment and this was the “game changer”. In parallel, David and others were working on vaccines and immune responses and found that the virus could escape from just about any immune response thrown at it. Finally, the groundbreaking PrEP studies (Pre-exposure prophylaxis) resulted in TRUVADA which prevents a sexually active person from getting infected with HIV. We still have a large number of people already infected and they need to get on treatment, but in that example, science found a solution to the epidemic. In short, the epidemic was solved without a vaccine.",

David’s lab is trying to develop monoclonal antibodies against both this novel coronavirus while also keeping an eye toward the future on the next one that is evitable. Making monoclonal antibodies simply means taking from the best responders with the best antibodies, cloning them and distributing that to everybody because we’re not all able to make those robust and highly specific and high-binding neutralizing antibodies.",

  "content": "Assuming we could reduce the viral load upon first contact by 70-80% through some combination of monoclonal antibodies or effective vaccines… That could have a commensurate reduction in mortality and spread. And much of the damage out the gate with coronavirus was nosocomial (transmission within hospitals) which also probably means higher viral loads. So a combo therapy of a non-perfect vaccine with monoclonal antibodies that could reduce viral load would be crucial.",
