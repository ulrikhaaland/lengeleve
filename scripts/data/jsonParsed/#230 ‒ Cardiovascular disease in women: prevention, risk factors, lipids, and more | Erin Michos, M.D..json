It’s more likely they’ll stay on it. She uses combination therapy early. She aims for <55, optimal LDL-C is probably around 30 or lower in these patients. High intense statins will lower the LDL by about 50% but if you need a greater reduction, think about combination therapy early.",

The PCSK9 inhibitors that we were talking about (evolocumab and alirocumab) are monoclonal antibodies. They lower LDL by about 50-60%. They also lower Lp(a) by around 25%.",

Alone bempedoic acid lowers LDL about 18% (in the range of ezetimibe). It lowers LDL a little more (21%) if it’s used as a monotherapy without statins.",

But she doesn’t actively prescribe it because there really isn’t good data to support it. The same thing with vitamin D, there really isn’t good data that taking a vitamin D supplement can prevent statin associated muscle symptoms. But many patients want to take that.",

About 80% of LDL is synthesized by the liver, so there is a strong genetic component. But the other 20% is influenced by diet, so diet does matter. Particularly in younger adults, thinking about adolescents and young adults. If we can shift everybody a little bit lower in their LDL by following a healthy diet from early childhood, this will reduce the total burden of years with LDL elevation.",

HRT should not hurt somebody while it is used for its many benefits on the brain, bone health, vasomotor symptoms, eventually vaginal atrophy and things like that for which there are no alternatives. There is a slight increase in risk and this needs to be weighed in the balance. Prevention is the key. Start early and be aggressive to give yourself more options later in life. The risk for HRT is in women with established cardiovascular disease. If there’s no atherosclerosis, then the vasodilatory effects and the lowering of LDL may be helpful in preventing the initiation of atherosclerosis. But for a woman who already has disease, the slight increase in inflammatory markers, a pro-formatic effect may tip them over to having a vascular event.",

There is a lot we can do to tackle this. Have more representation by diversifying study teams and investigators. Include more women in trial designs, patient-centered designs. It’s really important to include women in the design and try to understand some of these design issues. Making sure that the study designs are not so restrictive in terms of the inclusion exclusion criteria.
