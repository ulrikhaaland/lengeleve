We know that smoking and diabetes, in addition to the FH (familial hypercholesterolemia), also eliminate any premenopausal advantage.

So even exposure to mild or moderately elevated LDL for a sufficient number of years does increase the risk of ASCVD to an earlier onset compared to individuals who have had lifetime low LDL.

The use of combination therapy (including with PCSK9 inhibitors) is very underutilized, at something like 6% in this cohort.

Even modest weight loss can have a pretty significant impact on triglycerides and blood pressure reduction. So it’s always important that we can talk about all the new exciting therapies we have for weight loss, like the GLP-1 receptor agonists and the dual agonists, but really still emphasizing a healthy lifestyle from childhood is still such an important strategy for prevention.",

She points out, “We put too much blame on the individual, but we have major societal population problems with the easy access to poor quality food, these highly processed foods that are extremely palatable but contain a lot of saturated fats and other additives and sugars. The way our jobs are structured to be more sedentary and long commute times, having access to safe places to exercise and having time to do so, and the increased stress levels in life. I mean, there’s so many social determinants of health that have led to this problem.” There are huge parts of the country that are food deserts, where there is not access to fruits or vegetables. There are also food swamps, where only cheap and easy, highly processed packaged foods are available. As individuals, we do have some responsibility for our life choices. Erin contends that larger issues should be placed in regulation and policy on a population level. Once an individual is obese, it’s much harder to lose weight. It’s far more complicated than just calories in, calories out. There are all kinds of hormonal regulations. The good news is we do have some new pharmacological agents that are beneficial in weight loss, that do not have cardiovascular harm like some of the older weight loss drugs. These may actually be cardiovascularly beneficial. We know the GLP-1 receptor agonist, at least in patients with type 2 diabetes, reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and stroke.

Total cholesterol and LDL increase rapidly after mense and peak during the follicular phase. Then this is followed by a decline in the luteal phase, which corresponds to the rise in the peak concentration of estrogen and progesterone. When estradiol is the highest in the menstrual cycle, this leads to a fall in total cholesterol and LDL. HDL is highest around ovulation. Triglycerides didn’t really have a consistent pattern during the menstrual cycle. So there isn’t specific guidance. It’s interesting to note this change in cholesterol during the menstrual cycle. This is useful to know for women who are at very high risk for ASCVD and we’re trying to target these really intensive thresholds (like LDLs less than 70 or even lower). So while there’s no specific guidance around this, Erin generally recommends clinicians measure the lipid panel during the menses so that it’s ideally measured, monitored, and compared at the same time during the menstrual cycle.

  "content": "On average, there is about 30-50% increased risk of future cardiovascular risk for women with PCOS. There is a debate about whether PCOS is causally related to CVD. The excess risk for these women seems to be during reproductive age. After menopause, having a prior history of PCOS doesn’t seem to confer the same level of risk. This is likely because of all of the increased risk after the menopause transition. The low estradiol and the more androgen phenotype after menopause probably outweighs or overshadows any prior risk due to PCOS. But there does seem to be this long term risk. When you look at Mendelian randomization studies, they suggest that the elevated testosterone, the hyper androgen, the obesity, the higher insulin levels, insulin resistance and lower levels of sex binding globulin do appear to have a causal relationship with PCOS based on genetics. And so it may be that these are the mediating factors that link PCOS with future cardiovascular disease risk. Erin recently published a study looking at national data of pregnancies at delivery and showed that women with PCOS who did become pregnant were at greater risks for preeclampsia. There were more cases of gestational diabetes and cardiovascular complications in women with PCOS. It’s important to note that not only are they at increased risk, have decreased fertility and trouble getting pregnant, that once they do become pregnant they are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications in delivery. So it’s really important with PCOS that we optimize healthier lifestyle and weight management to mitigate some of the cardiometabolic risk. Erin thinks a GLP-1 receptor agonists may help women with PCOS (who are not trying to become pregnant), help them with weight management and insulin resistance. Even statin therapy may reduce some of the testosterone or androgen associated risk.",

  "content": "When you look at parity (or the number of live births), there does seem to be a J-shaped relationship with more than 4-5 live births being associated with subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease. The reason for this is not quite known. Erin showed in the MEZA study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) that women who had grand multiparity were much more likely to be in poor cardiovascular health later in life at middle aged to older age compared to less parus women. Women tend to gain weight with each pregnancy. There may be also dysregulation of adipokines that sets the stage for later cardiometabolic complications. This is why it’s really important that we try to optimize women’s cardio metabolic health before pregnancy and between pregnancies, to try to prevent these long term complications. Erin wouldn’t tell a woman that they can’t become pregnant a certain number of times, but she would really try to work with them to try to optimize their cardiometabolic health. Peter thinks the obvious observation is that the more pregnancies a woman has, the more likely she will have difficulty getting back to her never-pregnant state of metabolic health. This seems like a big risk factor. Erin points out that epidemiology studies don’t ask men about their parity history. A couple studies did ask men about their number of children, and increased parity seems to be a risk factor for CVD in men too. This gets to Peter’s point about confounding by social economic factors and cultural factors, education factors that might lead a family to have more children rather than less. But the risk does seem to be a little greater in women suggesting that there may be some true biological effects, maybe weight mediated beyond just confounding by socioeconomic and cultural factors.",

Estrogen can increase triglyceride levels and it can lower LDL. Peter has seen analysis that once you correct for apoB, triglycerides below 400 mg/dL don’t really mean anything. Above that level you have to start worrying about pancreatitis. Erin adds that pregnancy also increases triglyceride levels a lot. So preventing an unwanted pregnancy outweighs the risk from a slight change in this lipids due to oral contraceptives. She thinks the changes in lipids are relatively modest, especially since lower estrogen formulations are typically used now. However, for women who already have high baseline triglycerides to begin with, it can trigger severe hypertriglyceridemia above 500 mg/dL. So you wouldn’t want these patients to go on oral contraceptives. The transdermal combined oral hormonal contraceptives (the patch) is less likely to cause clinically relevant elevations in triglycerides. There are other types of contraceptives that can be used by very high risk women with established cardiovascular disease or women who have FH (familial hypercholesterolemia) and have very high LDL levels. Long-acting reversible methods like the IUD and implant are safe and effective. Progesterone-based IUDs like the Mirena with the progesterone releasing IUD system, they can marginally lower associated with lower HDL, but usually these revert back to pre-insertion levels by 1 year. Most of the time for the IUDs, the triglycerides and LDL and the cholesterol ratios remain pretty stable.",

There are changes in the lipid panel, which is why women with known lipid disorders are recommended to have consultation with a lipid specialist prior to pregnancy. But even normal pregnancies, serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, Lp(a) and HDL cholesterol levels all gradually increase. And as pregnancy proceeds, they peak during the 3rd trimester. You can have about a 25 to 50% increase in total cholesterol, and as much as 150-300% increase in triglycerides, and LDL increase by 66%. These are normal physiologic changes because it’s designed to promote accumulation of maternal fat stores that’s going to be a source of calories for the mother and the fetus during later stages of pregnancy and lactation. The cholesterol increases are needed for utero, placental vascularization, placental steroids, synthesis, placental transport function. These are important physiological effects. For someone like Peter’s wife, who started out with low cholesterol levels, these changes are generally thought to be non-atherogenic because they return back to pre-pregnancy levels following delivery. Erin notes, “Pregnancy is not a good time to get a baseline lipid panel because it’s not going to be representative of what a woman’s typical lipid panel is”. For women who have concern for lipid disorder, having a baseline lipid panel before pregnancy is helpful so that you can know what to expect. And women with FH, they have the same relative increases, but they’re starting with such a high baseline level that the magnitude of elevation is even greater.",

Definition of menopause: when a woman hasen’t had a menstrual cycle for 12 months (this usually happens around age 51). Early onset of menopause (before age 40 or even 45) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. After menopause, women have lower levels of estrong than men do. Erin mentions this because a lot of her research has been about sex hormone levels after menopause. She has shown that postmenopausal women who have higher androgen levels have a greater risk of developing ASCVD and heart failure (HF) over the next 12 years (summarized in the figure below).

We prescribed HRT for years. Erin’s mother used to be on hormone therapy. This was all well before the Women’s Health Initiative Study (2002). There are favorable and unfavorable changes that occur with hormone therapy, especially combined therapy. Favorable changes include lower HDL and increased HDL. This is from systemic oral estrogen (and to some degree transdermal). Vaginal estrogens don’t have much systemic absorption. For women who just have the genitourinary symptoms, even in women with cardiovascular disease or history of stroke, you can use vaginal estrogens safely. Oral estrogens dilate the blood vessels through a nitric oxide effect. Which may be cardioprotective. Unfavorable changes‒ Estrogens can increase CRP (C-reactive protein). Women have higher CRP levels and estrogens are prothrombotic. This is why there is some increased risk with oral contraceptives, particularly in women who are older of reproductive age and combined with smoking and also during pregnancy. Estrogens can increase prothrombin and decrease antithrombin III. Estrogen (from oral contraceptives or hormone therapy) can increase triglycerides. In higher risk women, particularly those that are farther out from the menopause transition or those with established cardiovascular disease, these adverse changes may outweigh any favorable benefits. And that’s why probably the Women’s Health Initiative reported risk from HRT. This study had the mean age of 63, and most of these women were quite far from the menopause transition. They also used an oral conjugated equine estrogen with progestin formulation, and we saw a 2-fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism. So this is why the guidelines all changed, and we don’t recommend hormone therapy for the sole purpose of cardiovascular disease prevention because we have many other things we can use for prevention (like statins). But the pendulum doesn’t have to swing so far away, if you look at sub-analyses of these trials of women that were closer to the menopause transition (younger women), we don’t see this excess harm.",

Even if we don’t’ know if a drug is going to be beneficial or not. There’s a lot of benefits with being part of a trial because you have more access to gold standard care and more access to study investigators. It’s really important to include women in the design and try to understand some of these design issues, which may be not so obvious. Such as making sure there’s no hidden costs that often people are paid for the drug or device. There can be things related to transportation or time off work or providing for childcare, other responsibilities by having more flexible follow-up, more pragmatic trials or having a follow-up being online or by phone or by PCP. That may get over some of the barriers to enrolling women in the trials. Making sure that the study designs are not so restrictive in terms of the inclusion exclusion criteria. We shouldn’t just exclude women of childbearing age if they have a plan for preventing pregnancy (adequate contraception); women should be eligible for these trials. Not to mention we actually need more trials in pregnant women too. It’s just so important to understand what works and what’s safe.",
