  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug aducanumab for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The monoclonal antibody treatment aimed to slow the progression of memory and cognitive problems arising early in AD by decreasing amyloid beta in the brain. It has been nearly two decades since an AD drug was last approved and further, a potential disease-modifying treatment is unlike the four approved drugs for AD, which treat symptoms of the disease and not the disease itself.",

  "date": "June 13, 2021",
  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There is certainly controversy and considerable public debate around the drug’s approval; after the FDA approved the treatment, three FDA advisory panel members resigned. The drug is now in the arsenal of drug treatment for AD, and with that, there are as many questions as answers, involving the real-world efficacy, safety, and application of the drug.",

  "date": "June 13, 2021",
  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There are questions around what the efficacy of aducanumab will look like in clinical practice, and what the real-world safety will be. As part of aducanumab’s accelerated approval, the FDA requires Biogen to complete a phase 4 confirmatory trial to verify the drug’s clinical benefit. Additional information on the drug’s safety and efficacy will also come from its use in clinical practice, which will shape its clinical use applications.",

  "date": "June 13, 2021",
  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The drug costs 56,000 dollars a year. In addition, patients must receive monthly infusions. The route of administration is quite different from taking a pill: there is a decisional balance that involves time expenditure and level of duress. Given the uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of the drug treatment, these hurdles perhaps hold greater significance.",

  "date": "June 13, 2021",
  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There is ambiguity around how to use the drug, which may sound like an unexpected unknown for a drug that has just been approved by the FDA. The clinical trial was very specific about how the drug was used: to treat patients in the mild cognitive impairment stage of AD who had amyloid beta—a protein biomarker of AD. The drug was approved based on its ability to reduce amyloid in the brain, rather than based on a clinical measure such as delaying cognitive decline.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The FDA is leaving such a broad range of drug application decisions in the hands of clinicians. This discretionary responsibility, which demands a case-by-case approach to care, will quickly reveal how the field will need to amend its current diagnostic methods and data collection practices. The evolution in clinical diagnostics, such as blood tests for amyloid and tau, will be used in a few years to risk stratify patients and also guide treatment.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Given the outstanding questions around the safety and efficacy of aducanumab, the drug’s approval has been met with reticence by some clinicians. The introduction of aducanumab will surely require education and guidance to help the field navigate the role of this drug in clinical practice and expectations will evolve when more data become available. Every drug treatment has its costs and benefits and those are relative terms, depending on the patient and context. There is nonetheless an exciting possibility for the drug’s approval to propel the push for a new era of AD care that includes routine testing for various disease biomarkers, such as beta amyloid.",
