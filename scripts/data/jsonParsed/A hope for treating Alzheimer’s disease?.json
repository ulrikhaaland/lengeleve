  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The FDA approved the drug aducanumab for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The monoclonal antibody treatment aimed to slow the progression of memory and cognitive problems arising early in AD by decreasing amyloid beta in the brain. It has been nearly two decades since an AD drug was last approved and further, a potential disease-modifying treatment is unlike the four approved drugs for AD, which treat symptoms of the disease and not the disease itself.",

  "date": "June 13, 2021",
  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There are questions around what the efficacy of aducanumab will look like in clinical practice, and what the real-world safety (outside the confines of a structured clinical trial) will be. As part of aducanumab’s accelerated approval, the FDA requires Biogen (the pharmaceutical company that manufactures aducanumab under the brand name Aduhelm) to complete a phase 4 confirmatory trial to verify the drug’s clinical benefit. Additional information on the drug’s safety and efficacy will also come from its use in clinical practice, which will shape its clinical use applications.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "The drug costs 56,000 dollars a year. In addition, patients must receive monthly infusions. The route of administration is quite different from taking a pill: there is a decisional balance that involves time expenditure and level of duress. Given the uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of the drug treatment, these hurdles perhaps hold greater significance.",

  "context": "Medications, Supplements & Other Treatments",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There is also ambiguity around how to use the drug, which may sound like an unexpected unknown for a drug that has just been approved by the FDA. The clinical trial was very specific about how the drug was used: to treat patients in the mild cognitive impairment stage of AD who had amyloid beta—a protein biomarker of AD. The drug was approved based on its ability to reduce amyloid in the brain (which is correlated with improving mild cognitive impairment), rather than based on a clinical measure such as delaying cognitive decline.",

  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "It is interesting that the FDA is leaving such a broad range of drug application decisions in the hands of clinicians. This discretionary responsibility, which demands a case-by-case approach to care, will quickly reveal how the field will need to amend its current diagnostic methods and data collection practices. The evolution in clinical diagnostics, such as blood tests for amyloid and tau, will be used in a few years to risk stratify patients and also guide treatment (much like commonly used cholesterol tests today). Further, genetic testing may also soon become part of a standard of care, especially considering that patients with two copies of the ApoE4 gene are at higher risk for developing side effects from the treatment, which include brain swelling and bleeding.",
