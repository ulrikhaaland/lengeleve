Muscle tissue is about 70% water and about 30% protein, so if you add 25 lbs of muscle in a year, it’s about 10 grams of amino acids deposited in muscle per day. They’re probably going to be nitrogen positive a little bit. No matter how much muscle mass you put on, it’s never going to be impressive relative to the amount of amino acids you took in.",

Many hormones are actually regulating the different steps.

Layne guesses that if you’re not getting exogenous testosterone, then there’s probably not a negative feedback regulation loop. It would make sense that the muscle might increase its androgen receptor density to meet the free testosterone load as long as there’s not so much testosterone that sets up a negative feedback loop to the gonads or reduces luteinizing hormone or increases aromatization.",

  "content": "Much of Stu Phillips’s work indicates that muscle growth appears to be mostly intrinsically regulated. In the late 90s and early 2000s, the focus was on systemic regulation of muscle growth (e.g., systemic levels of testosterone or IGF-1, noting that resistance exercise will increase testosterone for 30 – 60 minutes). Work by Stu and others suggest that muscle growth is likely an effect of tension. Mechano-growth factor is probably involved. People don’t realize that systemic IGF-1 and growth hormone are not anabolic to skeletal muscle (meaning that they do not build it up). We know that growth hormone increases in response to certain factors like fasting, resistance training, exercise in general, sleep, etc. Growth hormone response to exercise appears to be mostly substrate driven.",

If you train your legs, your arms don’t get bigger. If you train one leg, the other one doesn’t get bigger. Some of the best resistance training studies use unilateral training.

A sarcomere has two ends which are called Z disks, and in between you have actin and myosin, which overlap. When a muscle contracts, actin and myosin are linked together and pulling. The Z disc is where phosphatidic acid is stored. To transform a mechanical signal into a chemical signal, it makes sense to store the signal in the Z disc where a lot of the mechanical tension is felt. Mechanistic studies suggest that mechanical tension causes phosphatidic acid to be released. Phosphatidic acid is a stimulator of mTOR.",

They still increased lean body mass, but the group that was getting more carbohydrates had more lean body mass. Mettler study found that diet composition made a difference in maintenance of lean body mass. Measured subjects’ performance in exercises like squat and bench press. Suggests that perhaps there is something different in terms of actual contractile tissue, but a lot more research is needed. You can definitely build muscle on a ketogenic diet, but likely can build more if you’re including carbohydrates.
