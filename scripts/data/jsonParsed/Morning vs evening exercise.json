  "content": "According to a recent study, evening exercise may be more potent than morning workouts for improving metabolic health in men eating a “fatty diet.” The study consisted of 24 men who were set up with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and meal deliveries. For each of the 11 days of the study, participants received pre-packed meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, each containing about a third of energy intake based on individual resting metabolic rate, with the macronutrient composition of about 65% fat, 15% carbohydrate, and 20% protein (which I’ll refer to as a low-carb, high-fat diet or LCHFD from here on out). For the first five days of the study, all of the participants ate the diet and then were randomized into one of three groups. The morning group exercised at 6:30 AM, the evening group exercised at 6:30 PM, and the control group did not exercise for the next five consecutive days while continuing the diet.",

  "content": "After five days of “fatty eating,” low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) had climbed alongside “worrisome molecular patterns” in their blood. The morning exercise did not appear to mitigate these effects while evening exercise mitigated the impacts of the “poor diet.” The evening exercise group also experienced better overnight blood glucose control than the other two groups.",

  "context": "Exercise & Physical Health",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "One of the biggest potential problems with this study is sleep, or a lack thereof. Recall that the morning group commenced exercise at 6:30 AM. Is it possible that some of the participants needed to shift their sleep and wake times? Another limitation to the study is the timing of the blood draws and other tests between the two exercising groups. The evening exercise group was tested 12 hours after their last training session compared with 24 hours for the morning exercise group which could impact the results.",

  "content": "Cardiorespiratory fitness (measured by VO2peak) was improved by five days of exercise, regardless of the time of day of training. According to the study, only the evening group induced further improvements in glycemic control. The evening exercisers had lower nocturnal glucose levels — defined as the mean glucose concentration from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM — compared to when they consumed the LCHFD alone. Their nocturnal glucose decreased from 95 to 88 mg/dL during this time. The morning exercisers? Their nocturnal glucose decreased from 99 to 94 mg/dL.",
