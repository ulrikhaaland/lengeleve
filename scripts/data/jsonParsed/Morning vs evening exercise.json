  "content": "Evening exercise may be more potent than morning workouts for improving metabolic health in men eating a “fatty diet.” Late-day workouts moderated the undesirable health effects of a greasy diet, while morning exercise did not. The exercise consisted of alternating days of short duration, high-intensity interval training and long duration, moderate intensity training, all performed on stationary bikes. After five days of “fatty eating,” low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) had climbed alongside “worrisome molecular patterns” in their blood. The morning exercise did not appear to mitigate these effects while evening exercise mitigated the impacts of the “poor diet.” The evening exercise group also experienced better overnight blood glucose control than the other two groups.",

  "title": "Study Limitations",
  "date": "October 3, 2021",
  "context": "Exercise & Physical Health",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "A couple of obvious limitations to this study are the sample sizes and duration. This is an 11-day experiment with eight participants in each of the three groups. The investigators studied the effects of just five days of exercise in men who underwent a dramatic dietary change less than a week before engaging in the exercise. One of the biggest potential problems with this study is sleep, or a lack thereof. All but one participant in the morning group had their sleep pattern disrupted during the exercise portion of the study. Another limitation to the study is the timing of the blood draws and other tests between the two exercising groups.",

  "content": "Their fasting triglyceride (TG) levels decreased from about 136 to 111 mg/dL, which is somewhat encouraging. Their LDL-C on the other hand increased from 116 to 124 mg/dL, which is not exactly disturbing, especially in light of the fact that these participants are just a handful of days into a dramatic change in their diets. Also, after five days on the diet, 24-hour CGM glucose concentrations decreased from 101 to 95 mg/dL.",

  "content": "Cardiorespiratory fitness (measured by VO2peak) was improved by five days of exercise, regardless of the time of day of training. According to the study, only the evening group induced further improvements in glycemic control. The evening exercisers had lower nocturnal glucose levels compared to when they consumed the LCHFD alone. Their nocturnal glucose decreased from 95 to 88 mg/dL during this time. The morning exercisers? Their nocturnal glucose decreased from 99 to 94 mg/dL.",

  "content": "Fasting blood glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-C concentrations significantly decreased only in the evening exercise group. Despite making dozens of comparisons of traditional biomarkers, the investigators did not adjust their p-values for multiple hypothesis testing, increasing the probability that at least some of the results may be statistically significant even though there is no underlying effect.",

  "content": "The importance of exercise timing in order to increase the potency of exercise as medicine is highlighted. The short duration and sample size of the study alone are severe limitations to establishing any reliable or practical knowledge on its own. Sleep loss in the morning exercisers, and the discrepancy in the timing of the blood draws, can easily confound the true relationship between morning and evening exercise and metabolic outcomes.",
