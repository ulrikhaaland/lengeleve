  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "There is a brewing controversy around the origins of the virus responsible for COVID-19. There is no information in the public domain either regarding the viral sequence or other circumstantial evidence that would help answer the question about the origins of the virus. At the time of the pandemic’s arrival, it was believed that this was a virus of zoonotic origin. Thought to be a virus that occurred naturally. Likely originated from bats and transferred to an intermediary animal and then eventually humans in the wet markets of Wuhan, China. In early 2020, some critics began to question the zoonotic origin theory. they were met with the sharpest rebukes from both the scientific and political communities. The Lancet and Nature Medicine both published statements critical of the lab leak theory. Said such statements were xenophobic or otherwise ill-informed and conspiratorial. Since that time, however, there has been a push for greater transparency. Starting in March 2021, an international coalition of more than 20 scientists (organized by Jamie Metzl) published four open letters calling for an investigation into the lab leak theory. The call to investigate the lab leak theory is driven by two factors: Unlike the cases of SARS-1 and MERS, which are very similar viruses, there has yet to be any identified species of origin and/or intermediary despite much effort. There has been an abject lack of transparency to date. In an autocratic nation like China, transparency is not a cultural norm, whether this was a lab leak or not. An inability to find the cause or discovery of a mistake would not have been acknowledged to the international scientific community. Why did we not take the lab leak theory seriously a year or 18 months ago when it might have been easier to gather information? Robert Redfield, the former head of the CDC, offered to send in a team of experts to do widespread testing in Wuhan, especially the WIV. He thinks a lab leak could have been ruled out in a couple weeks if this had been done, but the Chinese government refused and destroyed records instead. It also blocked access to the mine where workers had been sickened months before the pandemic by a virus similar to SARS2.",

The CDC estimates that 6 out of 10 infectious diseases in people come from animals, including diseases caused by coronaviruses. Some form of human and animal contact (markets, farms) is far more common than lab accidents. In the past, initial and intermediate host animals sometimes have not been identified long after outbreaks. The natural source of the Ebola virus remains a mystery (perhaps a bat or chimp).

We see only the one-in-a-billion that natural selection picks for survival. Genetic study shows the virus carries all the messy hallmarks of nature and none of the fingerprints that would have been left behind by laboratory manipulation. SARS2 could have jumped directly from bats to humans without going through an intermediate host. In an October 2013 Nature study, Shi Zhengli reported that certain bat viruses could potentially infect humans without first jumping to an intermediate animal, entering human cells through the ACE2 receptor. SARS-2 appears to be similar to a virus that infected Chinese miners in 2012. 6 miners who shoveled bat guano out of a mine in southern China (Yunnan province) were infected with a bat coronavirus. Guano was from rufous horseshoe bats, the same kind that triggered SARS-1, developed symptoms similar to future COVID-19 patients, and 3 of them died. Chinese authorities never reported this to the World Health Organization as required. Samples from the miners were taken to WIV where the virus was named BtCoV/4991. It was later renamed RaTG13 in lab records for unclear reasons. Only known now because an anonymous science teacher from India (“The Seeker” on Twitter) found this information in a database of Chinese student theses he searched. The miners’ illness from RaTG13 (the closest known relative of SARS2) is evidence it can jump directly to humans under certain conditions (massive overexposure in that case). Could explain why no one has so far found a trace of SARS2 in any intermediate host or in human populations before December 2019. Could also explain why SARS2 did not need to mutate multiple times before it first appeared in humans. RaTG13 is 96.2% similar to SARS2.",

  "content": "The debate about gain-of-function (GoF) research. The precise definition of gain-of-function (GoF) research varies. The term “gain-of-function” was probably coined  at a 2012 meeting at the NIH. An NIAID scientist has said that “the term gain-of-function … is a vague and unsatisfactory term for microbiologists”. Generally means manipulating a virus to make it either more transmissible or more virulent. The goal of GoF research is to allow scientists to develop tests, treatments, and vaccines for potential outbreaks. Predict which microorganisms in nature are potential threats and then figure out how to protect humans or carrier animals ahead of time. Anticipate how dangerous viruses might spread. Allow surveillance and monitoring by identifying the most dangerous strains in nature and tracing them to see if mutations are developing. Perhaps could forecast mutations like the new delta variant of SARS2. Debates about the value of GoF research. The discussion began around 2011 when research was done on flu strains engineered to spread in ferrets. A scientist named Ron Fouchier did GoF research with the H5N1 virus and through lab manipulations created a pathogen that he claimed was highly dangerous and infectious. Led to the formation of an anti-GoF research alliance called the Cambridge Working Group. Scientists have debated its utility ever since. Some say it is not the most useful approach scientifically. Even if we find one potentially dangerous mutation, there could be thousands of others we’d miss.",

  "content": "There are no signs of deliberate genetic modification in the virus’s code (although this would not necessarily be possible to detect). One scientist said that the virus infects people in a novel way that is “too good” to have been a lab creation: “no human using a computer could do this”. Molecular-modeling software predicted that if you wanted to optimize an existing bat virus so that it would replicate well in human cells, you would design it in a different way than the SARS-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 does binds human ACE2 with high affinity, but computational analyses find that the RBD sequence is different from those that would be optimal for receptor binding, suggesting natural selection rather than human manipulation. SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone. If it were manufactured, a new, unpublished backbone would have to have been used, which seems unlikely.",

It was later discovered that the statement was organized by Peter Daszak. Though he and 6 others with ties to EcoHealth Alliance signed the statement, no conflicts of interest were declared (this was amended in June 2021). If a lab leak occurred, Daszak would not necessarily be aware of it, but he would have a large interest in it not being true. Nicholas Wade has sharply criticized Daszak’s reaction to the pandemic, charging that instead of sharing the information he knew, “he immediately launched a public relations campaign” to discredit the lab leak theory. Daszak left the UN-Lancet commission investigating the pandemic origins in June 2021 after it became public that he had organized the initial statement. Recent reports allege that Google has funded EcoHealth Alliance research, raising questions about media neutrality about the lab leak theory.",

  "title": "The uncertain significance of the furin cleavage site",
  "date": "July 19, 2021",
  "context": "COVID-19",
  "people": "Peter Attia",
  "content": "Cellular entry of both SARS1 and SARS2 viruses is mediated by the binding of receptors on the host cell surface (primarily ACE2) to the viral receptor-binding domain. But ACE2 has a 10-to-20 fold higher affinity for SARS2 than SARS1. Furin, which is found on human cell surfaces, will cut any protein chain that carries a specific amino acid sequence. Unlike SARS1, SARS2 has a proline-arginine-arginine-alanine (PRRA) insert that, when combined with the subsequent arginine (R) on the end, creates arginine-arginine-alanine-arginine (RRAR), a furin cleavage site. This site may be the reason why SARS2 infection is stronger than SARS1. The virus can’t invade a cell until its two subunits have been cut apart, and the furin cleavage site ensures that the spike protein will be cleaved in exactly the right place. If S1 and S2 are cut before maturity, it may allow S1 more flexibility to alter its conformation to better fit the host receptor, making the virus more infectious by allowing it to efficiently enter human cells. Some evidence suggests that the furin cleavage site was added in a lab. Of all known subtype B beta-coronaviruses, only SARS2 possesses a furin cleavage site. The PRRA insert is not found in any other subtype B beta coronaviruses (although there is one in some other beta coronaviruses such as MERS, which is subtype C). Its higher affin­ity for hu­man ACE2 re­cep­tors than any other an­i­mal species so far tested, in­clud­ing horse­shoe bats, suggesting it was be­ing cul­tured in hu­man cells. SARS2 seems to have only feeble affinity for bat cells, raising questions about whether it came from a bat. SARS2’s most notable features, the furin site and the human ACE2-binding domain, were unlikely to have arisen simultaneously. SARS2 also has a flat ganglioside-binding domain (GBD) on the spike protein which is different from other coronaviruses in its pattern of host evasion survival.",

What they’re saying is, ‘Why can’t we have a full investigation?’” —Katherine Eban [56:30]. The lab leak theory: did SARS2 escape from a lab in Wuhan? [1:00:00]. Proponents of lab escape believe that they can explain all the available facts about SARS2 considerably more easily than can those who favor natural emergence. Wuhan is home to WIV, where researchers were genetically engineering bat coronaviruses to attack human cells under the minimal safety conditions of a BSL2 lab. The evidence much more easily explained by the fact that the initial outbreak city housed a laboratory doing aggressive SARS research on an extensive collection of bat viruses. This theory includes a scenario in which a natural virus the researchers were working with escaped from the lab and an alternate scenario in which a virus that had been altered by researchers escaped. It’s too much of a coincidence that a pandemic caused by a novel bat coronavirus started in a city that also happens to contain a laboratory doing aggressive SARS research on an extensive collection of bat viruses.",

The two closest known relatives of the SARS2 virus were collected from bats living in caves in Yunnan Province, but the pandemic broke out in Wuhan, which is 1,500 kilometers away. Horseshoe bats’ typical range is ~50 kilometers. You would need a longstanding population of bats in frequent proximity with an intermediate host, which in turn must often cross paths with people. The infected person (or animal) carrying this highly transmissible virus must have traveled to Wuhan without infecting anyone else. Many cases had no link to the wet market in Wuhan as originally stated (the Chinese gov admitted in late May 2020 that it had ruled out the market as the origin point of the outbreak). The pandemic began at a time when horseshoe bats were hibernating. SARS2 has not evolved as would be expected with zoonotic transmission. The coronavirus spike protein makes multiple failed jumps to another species before it develops the necessary mutation. SARS1 had successive changes in its spike protein as the virus evolved, but SARS2 has changed hardly at all until recently. The uniform structure of SARS2 genomes gives no hint of any passage through an intermediate animal host, and no such host has been identified in nature.",
