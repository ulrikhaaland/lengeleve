  "content": "The content of a recent article examined the evidence for the theory that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted from a virus lab escape as opposed to a natural virus that came from an animal host. The evidence for both theories was discussed as well as the long and troubling history of dangerous lab leaks and safety concerns about the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The controversy surrounding gain-of-function research and its funding by the US government was also discussed. The likelihood of definitively establishing the origins of the virus given the Chinese government’s lack of cooperation was highlighted, and the many barriers to performing a full investigation may be the most troubling aspect of the controversy.",

Many cases had no link to the wet market in Wuhan as originally stated. The pandemic began at a time when horseshoe bats were hibernating. SARS2 has not not evolved as would be expected with zoonotic transmission. The coronavirus spike protein makes multiple failed jumps to another species before it develops the necessary mutation. SARS1 had successive changes in its spike protein as the virus evolved, but SARS2 has changed hardly at all until recently. We’re only now seeing variants of this virus (e.g., the delta variant). When SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late-epidemic SARS1. The uniform structure of SARS2 genomes gives no hint of any passage through an intermediate animal host, and no such host has been identified in nature.",
