  "content": "Layne Norton emphasizes the importance of consistency and behavior modification in achieving fitness goals. He notes that binging on junk food or blowing money on a shopping spree are due to behaviors that must be modified and new positive habits must be created. Marie Spreckley's systematic review found that maintenance of weight loss was associated with consistency and the ability to embrace challenges rather than running from them or viewing challenges as part of the process. Norton also stresses the need to change one's mindset from 'I have to exercise' to 'I am a fit person who exercises' to make it easier to do day in and day out.",

He cites Ethan Suplee, who lost a tremendous amount of weight and formed a new identity, as an example. Norton notes that you cannot create a new life while still dragging old behaviors behind you and that you must give some old habits up. He stresses that people need to persist after the honeymoon phase when facing their first challenge or setback.",

He compares exercise to brushing his teeth, noting that he doesn't need to be motivated to do it because if he doesn't, his body will suffer. Norton stresses that people need to buy in and persist after the honeymoon phase when facing their first challenge or setback.",

Don’t ask yourself if you can be like a specific person but instead if you can get better. When he started out, other people told him he wouldn’t be good at weightlifting. If he had listened to them, he never would have won a gold medal in the squat",
