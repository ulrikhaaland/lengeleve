  "content": "The GI system is basically a tube that begins at the mouth and ends at the anus. It’s hollow so the inside of the GI tract is really an internalized external space; it’s outside the body. If you bleed into your GI tract, you lose blood. This is one of the major crises in medicine‒ hidden bleeding in the GI tract. It can be very damaging, even if you don’t see any blood. The inside of your gut is outside of your body, and it provides a space for a community of extra organisms to live. This space is immense. This space can be dangerous and a barrier is necessary to keep it separate from the rest of you. This barrier is defended by the body. It also allows food to be digested and absorbed. It has to maintain the communication with the lumen, which is what we call the inside of the GI tract. There is a balance in the GI between protection of the body and allowing food stuff to come in.",

That disc undergoes a series of folds from head to toe, and from side to side, and the lateral or side folding produces the tube from which the gut forms. This takes place during the 1st trimester. The gut is fully developed between the 2nd and 3rd trimester. The first part of development is called embryogenesis. That is the fertilized egg forms the disc, the disc folds, the organs of the body form, and that’s the embryonic period. The fetal period follows. The fetal period models the organs into their appropriate developmental form so that they becomes functional enough to support a baby.",

The celiac artery supplies the pancreas, the stomach, the first part of the duodenum, and the liver and the gallbladder. The superior mesenteric artery supplies the midgut. That’s the longest part of the gut. That goes roughly to the mid-transverse colon. The inferior mesenteric artery supplies the end of the gut. When the celiac gives rise to the stomach and first part of the small intestines arterial supply (that then breaks into capillaries, absorbs materials from the gut), those capillaries drain into veins in the gut. And in a unique way, those veins then form large vessels which then move into the liver. They then break into capillaries, small vessels within the liver called sinusoids. So the liver depends on this venous system for its oxygen on blood that the gut has had a first crack at.",

The reason he calls it “The Second Brain” is that like the brain in the head, the nervous system of the gut is able to function and control reflexes and behavior independently of any influence from the brain or spinal cord. So it’s the only nervous system of the body that can work on its own, so if you completely isolate the gut from the brain and the spinal cord, it will function; you’re not dead. Years ago, when peptic ulcers were thought to be psychogenic, surgeons used to cut the vagus nerves, which are the major conduits that connect the brain and the gut. Afterward, the gut continued to soldier on. This never did all that much to fix peptic ulcer disease; that turned out to be caused by infection with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori.",

Nutrients that suppress ghrelin secretion include amino acids and fatty acids. The natural state is secretion of ghrelin and it’s the presence of nutrients that turn it down. Ghrelin is secreted at a constant rate that can be turned up or down. Inhibiting secretion is important to prevent the development of the ghrelin effect.",
