Expectations‒ if you’re coming into this thinking that this is going to be a podcast that’s about how to eat this and not that and affect your gut biome, it’s really not about that. This is a much more basic discussion, and I mean basic not in simple, but I mean basic in more elemental explanation, of how this system works.",

It’s hollow so the inside of the GI tract is really an internalized external space; it’s outside the body. If you bleed into your GI tract, you lose blood (even if you can’t see it). This is one of the major crises in medicine‒ hidden bleeding in the GI tract. It can be very damaging, even if you don’t see any blood. The inside of your gut is outside of your body, and it provides a space for a community of extra organisms to live. This space is immense. This space can be dangerous and a barrier is necessary to keep it separate from the rest of you. This barrier is defended by the body. It also allows food to be digested and absorbed. It has to maintain the communication with the lumen, which is what we call the inside of the GI tract.",

Hati is the most famous large outbreak; it occurred after an earthquake destroyed a lot of their infrastructure. Cholera is a simple illness, all one has to do is keep track of the water. Patients are put on what’s called a cholera cot; it has a gurney hole in the middle for the anus to be positioned over, and a bucket is put under it. The nurse puts a ruler into that bucket periodically to see how much fluid is coming out. This fluid is replaced intravenously and orally. A great life saving discovery was that although cholera blocked the absorption of sodium, it does not block the absorption of glucose in the small intestine.

It’s important to be able to put a nasogastric into them and decompress them. Even if you haven’t had a bowel obstruction, simply being bloated can be incredibly uncomfortable. “The only way the gut feels pain is in response to dilatation or pressure”‒ Michael Gershon. One can cut the inside of the gut with impunity; surgeons do this all the time when they take biopsies from inside the gut without anesthesia. From the point of view of pain, the gut is innervated differently from the skin. The skin feels pressure but this is much less painful than cutting; for the gut, the reverse is true.",

So the stomach senses the nutrients and the speed at which it empties, regulates the dilatation of the stomach and the signal that the stomach is sending back to urge satiety on the brain, which means that if you’re eating protein and fat, you will reach satiety much sooner than if you’re eating just salt and sugar.

Signals from the small intestine act as a back up signal to stop eating; it makes eating objectionable. What the gastric bypass is doing is to make eating so objectionable that it stops sooner and you eat much, much less. Another way to do this is to put a band on the stomach and interfere with the process of grinding the food won; this allows large particles to move into the small intestine and the same thing happens (signals to stop eating are released).",

Serotonin in the gut sends important signals. In sending signals from the gut to the brain, serotonin is an important transmitting substance.

As you might imagine, from the amount of it that’s in the bowel, serotonin does everything; it’s a multifunctional molecule.

Similarly, drugs that are used in cancer chemotherapy also trigger the release of serotonin within the gut and trigger that reflex. SSRIs also first make the gut go a little bit faster. But then when the gut keeps doing that, the receptors, that is the molecules upon which serotonin acts, desensitize. In terms of motility, they can make the gut go faster.

There are projections that come up from the surface of the gut that look like fingers (called villi). Most absorption occurs on the surfaces of these villi. Between the villi are invaginations called crypts. At the base of crypts there are stem cells. The stem cells, which live next to the Paneth cell, can give rise to each of the cells that form the villi, or line the gut. There’s an escalation of those cells; the progeny of the stem cells keep rising. As new ones form, other ones move up. In part, the proliferation in the crypt produces a pressure that causes cells to rise as they differentiate. But they’re also mobile; they crawl a little bit. At the tips of the villi, there’s a zone called the extrusion zone. Cells are born at the base of a crypt, climb up the crypt, up the villis, reach the tip of the villis, die, and are puffed off at that point. They stay in contact with one another, and the desmosomes are finally lost when the cells die, and they pop off. The mechanism of death is called apoptosis; they’re programmed to die.",

  "content": "If somebody has a substantially leaky gut, you could guess it from making a determination of the serum protein albumin. If the gut is leaking, albumin will be low. You can also look for an enzyme called alpha-1 antitrypsin. This is a protein found on the vascular side of the gut; it’s also in the blood/ plasma. Loss of protein into the gut is a sign of leaky gut; alpha-1 antitrypsin is a protein that is measured  as a marker for intestinal protein loss. If it gets onto stool there’s a problem. Deficiency in alpha-1 antitrypsin is a hereditary disease, which causes vascular and lung disease, because there’s too much digestive action damaging in those organs.",

These mice have central features that look like autism. It’s one of the many genes that can give rise to autism. Put into a mouse, it shows autism, and also defect in the gut. The defect in the gut has to do with serotonin, and the ability of serotonin to act as a growth factor. There’s a deficiency in terms of numbers of neuronal cells in the bowel. In a patient with autism spectrum disorder, similar kinds of things happen.",

  "content": "The greatest number of bacteria are present close to the colon. Some bacteria can survive in the presence of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, such as Helicobacter pylori. The small intestine neutralizes stomach acid. Small numbers of organisms entering the small intestine and its motility contribute to keeping the number of bacteria down in the small intestine. There are also cells (like Paneth cells) which make antibacterial proteins (called defensins) which help keep the lumen of the gut close to sterile. As you get closer and closer to the colon, these mechanisms are reduced and the number of organisms increases. The number of  Paneth cells decline, the gut slows down. In the colon there are huge numbers of organisms. There are an equal number of microbial cells in the colon as all the human cells in the body, trillions. A lot of Gram-negative. Almost all are anaerobes, they live in the absence of oxygen and are hard to grow in culture. They are characterized through molecular biology; you look for genes. There are about 16 different classes. Ones that we think of as good are the Bifidobacteria and Lactobacteria. Ones that are mostly bad (but not entirely) are the Clostridia. Some of those bacteria are related to causing cancer. Some are highly protective, and they do stuff for us. For example, one of the things we eat a lot of is fiber; celery or lettuce for example, we don’t digest that. We have bacteria in our gut that live on that fiber, they digest it and make short chain fatty acids from it. Those short chain fatty acids are absorbed by the lining of the colon. Our colonic epithelia are dependent on the bacteria to keep going. They get the bulk of their energy from the bacteria in the gut.",

There are changes in their immune system; they have no immune system. They have almost no spleen. They lack Peyer’s patches, important for talking to immune cells. They do have a thymus and can develop an immune system in a big hurry if they survive. These mice can be used as vessels to recolonize the gut with organisms. If you colonize them with bacteria derived from a strain of mice that tend to be lean, the mice grow up to be lean.

These studies have been done. Anxiety seems to work in a similar fashion. Fecal transplantation has an enormous potential. The only approved use currently is for infection with Clostridium difficile. With organisms that make up the normal flora, one way the number of each type is controlled is through a balance of growth with other bacteria. There’s a competition for nutrients. Bacteria make toxins that affect other types. A problem can arise when people take antibiotics; they have a major effect on the microbiome. A lot of people are exposed to antibiotics in agriculture. “This profligate use of antibiotics in agriculture exposes the human population to antibiotics, and changes our bacteria in ways that we would never have appreciated.”‒ Michael Gershon.",

From a general maintenance principle, for someone who is not taking a lot of antibiotics and wants to do what’s best for your gut, nutrition is one of the most important levers. The importance of insoluble fiber in the diet: 1 – fiber can absorb toxins; it is thought to decrease their long-term carcinogenic effects. 2 – It provides the colon something to “chew down on”; it’s good for motility and keeping the bowel going and in shape. 3 – It provides food for bacteria of the colon.
