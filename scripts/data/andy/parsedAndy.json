In powerlifting, force production is a one-rep max (in the case of lifting). In Olympic weightlifting, there are two lifts instead of three‒ one lift being called the snatch and the other one’s called the clean and jerk. Whoever can lift the most amount one time is the winner (one-rep max). The difference is this is now more an expression of power because although it’s all about one-rep max, it’s difficult to lift something over your head as high as possible slowly (there’s a speed component). It is an expression of tremendous strength, but there’s this velocity component to it. When you multiply force by velocity, now you’ve got power, and so technically the Olympic weightlifters are significantly more powerful than a powerlifter (despite the confusing name). This gets worse when we start roping in things like strongman. You would think that must be the biggest expression of strength, where in fact it’s not because strongman is contested over multiple repetitions. It is an expression of very, very high strength repeated several times. It’s not technically a true one-rep max.",

What are the metabolic demands? What makes these cells that are so ubiquitous in our body different from, say, the cells in our liver, the cells in our gut, the cells in our brain? What are these cells that we almost take for granted sometimes? What is the biggest organ in your body? Most people generally say the skin. As an exercise scientist and muscle physiologist, Andy gives all the credit to muscle. He doesn’t care about the organs that support muscles‒ the heart, the liver, the lungs, or his “worst enemy”, the nervous system. Andy is biased towards muscle. Muscle is going to be the largest organ in your body. It’s doing everything from supporting function, locomotion, to being your biggest reserve for amino acids, and your biggest dump for regulating metabolism. Peter hones in on this idea of muscle as a storage depot for amino acids. Layne did a great job talking about this in the podcast, explaining that we are constantly breaking down and adding new. There’s a pool of amino acids that’s turning over, and it’s very difficult to study them from a flux perspective. If you’re working out, it’s a plausible scenario that proteins are being broken down and amino acids released. These may not be resynthesized back into that same piece of skeletal muscle. They may be used for another application (Andy thinks this is guaranteed to happen). Andy uses an analogy to explain energetics. Andy shot a cheesy video 10 years ago in his backyard about the basics of energy using the analogy of a campfire. If you’re a outdoorsman and you are going to be out camping, you may need to create a fire. 1 – The first option is to use a match‒ it’s going to give you instantaneous energy (the fire) but it only lasts a few seconds. If you need energy right now, this is where you start. In terms of your tissue, this is going to be ATP and your phosphocreatine energy system. The stoichiometry is one to one, you break down one phosphocreatine to get one mole of ATP.",

And so skeletal muscle fibers can’t contract at different levels of force. Once this action potential threshold occurs (you flick the switch), the muscle fully contracts. This explains tetany‒ if you can track that fiber multiple times in a row before it’s reset then it feels like it’s in an isometric contraction. But what actually happens is you have so many muscle fibers contracting and relaxing at such a fast rate , it feels like the whole thing’s is locked up; but they’re actually flicking on flicking off.",

So if we had five fibers in that motor unit (or 500, it doesn’t really matter) we have a couple of factors coming on, but they’re generally going to be within that same motor unit. Thinking about how we relegate force production is this‒ we know that once all five of those muscle fibers get turned on, they are going to contract at full speed.

More than a few papers show a hypertrophic effect of slow-twitch fibers with aging. There is no loss in specific tension (which is like force per unit of size). There is no loss in power. It appears to be very easy with any level of activity to maintain and preserve health of slow-twitch fibers. But because fast-twitch fibers require force production and you generally don’t get high force production in activities of daily living, then those fibers go unutilized for long stretches of time. Eventually they go away. What we see happen is this really interesting thing called fiber type grouping, where the nerve will basically say, “Okay, that fiber is being not used,” and that whole motor unit will decay, and the fibers will be preserved. The other neighboring motor units will actually grow new extensions, activate some of the previously gone motor units and then convert those fibers into whatever fiber type of that previous motor unit. In general, what we see happening is slow-twitch motor units start absorbing fast-twitch fibers and bringing them to their motor unit. So we see these large patches of single fiber types throughout the muscle. When we see this fiber type grouping thing occur with aging, it’s almost exclusively a problem of fast-twitch fibers, not loss of slow-twitch fibers.

There are two microfilaments actin and myosin, and they overlap but they’re not touching each other. Myosin is a big thick tube laying in the middle; it has these heads that flick off the top. The idea is when you contract a muscle, myosin will reach outward and grab onto the actin, then pull the actin closer together. Force production is determined by cross-bridges. Cross-bridges are the connection between myosin heads and actin. The number of times these myosin heads grab onto actin, that little place of connection is called a crossbridge. The more those cross bridges you have, the more effectively you can pull the actin closer to each other. The faster the contraction. The more force that contraction is going to be. The thicker the myosin, the more likely it is to grab actin faster and stronger. There are six actin arranged in a circle surrounding each myosin in human skeletal muscle (depicted in the figure below).",

For a strong connection to happen and for it to be able to pull it together, it requires energy. A crude analogy is to imagine cocking a pistol. Squeezing the trigger takes a lot less energy than cocking the pistol. The energy we need from muscle contraction is not the pulling together; that’s almost passive. It’s the cocking it back part that takes energy. This energy comes from ATP. On the tip of that myosin head is an enzyme called ATPase. ATPase hydrolyzes ATP, and that gives you energy to put that myosin back into place (at the starting point of the cycle, ready for another contraction).",

    "content": "The speed of ATPase determines single muscle fiber contractile speed. Myosin heavy chain is measured in the lab, and that’s how fast-twitch versus slow-twitch is determined. You can use a technique called gel electrophoresis to compare different muscle fibers. It uses a solid gel between two pieces of glass. You put each individual muscle fiber in its own vertical lane. You run an electrical charge through the gel (positive charge at the top and negative charge at the bottom), and the muscle fibers move through the gel. You stop the electricity at some point, and the smaller fibers have moved further through the gel (because they are smaller, they move through the gel faster). You take a picture of the gel, and the muscle fibers that have gone down further are slow-twitch. The muscle fibers that remain higher up in the gel are fast-twitch. Molecular weight markers are used to confirm this. This means the myosin heavy chain molecular weight determines the fiber type and that regulates its twitch ability. The more heavy chains there are and the faster they work, the faster ATPase can operate, resulting in faster muscle fiber contraction. That’s why muscle fiber type is not predicated on signs. It’s specific to either metabolic abilities (in the old days) or twitch velocity (currently).",

But there’s nothing happening intracellularly? Andy doesn’t think that’s correct, and it doesn’t look to be the case. The juxtaposition. There’s a thing called lattice spacing, which is there’s an optimal distance between that myosin and actin. When trying to produce a powerful contraction, if myosin and actin are buttered up next to each other, they can’t actually squeeze that hard because there’s nowhere to go. Likewise, if they’re too extended, then they can’t squeeze. Peter adds, “It’s the same idea as preload in a heart”. Preload is going to determine stroke volume, everything coming in. Thinking about this spacing, if you start adding contractile units, then one way or another, you have to preserve the spacing somehow. The idea is it will expand hyperotrophically only to the level… There is a mathematical optimization for the exact strike distance between actin and myosin to not be overextended or under extended, a dn to have that perfect preload for maximum contraction. Peter asks, “If your hypertrophy training interfered with that and compromised it, you might gain size at the expense of potential strength”.",

People are familiar with the idea that about 70% of our weight is water. Most of this water is in the cells of our body, and the muscle is no exception. Going back to bodybuilding, Peter loves following Jay Cutler on Instagram. He’s one of the guys who in retirement is still training hard and paying attention to his nutrition. There was an interesting video where he went to In-N-Out Burger for his cheat meal. He places this monster order, and what surprised Peter was how much he said, “No salt, no salt”.

    "content": "Andy added isometrics in for a client for the purpose of low risk and getting a lot of stimuli without having to worry about getting in position at different parts. There is a thing called a strength curve, and when you do a typical isotonic movement (a normal lift), you’re only challenged in the areas in the range of motion where you’re the weakest. Andy did a study on lifting with bands, using heavy bands for a deadlift. He found there was a very low load at the bottom; as much as a 40% reduction in load at the bottom. But when you come up and start crossing the knee joint and start gaining mechanical advantage, it becomes extraordinarily easy, but the bands start getting heavier. So the actual tenacity that happens throughout the entire thing is greater at the top. This is why people use bands (and chains and things) to train the whole area of the strength curve. Bands allow you to be able to produce more resistance in areas where you’re stronger while not being held back by the weakest position. You can the use isometric to go into that weakest position without having to put a whole bunch of load on your body.",

    "content": "You can get into an RDL position (Romanian deadlift, like a hinge), which is a complicated movement, and you can grab and pull as hard as you want and nothing moves. It’s very difficult for people with a low training age to truly express maximum force output on a free range motion, because there are too many variables. It’s easier to just say, “Grab this bar and pull on it as hard as you possibly can”. Set the barbell in the squat rack, and set the height of the safety pins to w whatever height feels comfortable for you. You will pull up against that bar and nothing will move. Your back will feel comfortable wherever that range of motion is for you. Your glutes can be there; your feet can be in the right position. You’ll get total foot, big toe activation. You would start this things two-footed, but could do it one-legged. The goal is to express peak force output while feeling comfortable. Stay in this isometric position for three seconds. Some of Andy’s athlete’s will go up to five minutes on isometric holds. They’ll do a rear foot elevated split squat, isometric hold for up to five minutes, which presents a tremendous neurological challenge. The third day could be a whole day of isometrics. You could hold plank as an isometric exercise. Hold a hip extension position and make sure your glutes are on and utilized. You can do a squat in a couple of ways. You can go all the way down and hold that bottom position for 30 seconds (this is challenging if you don’t have the right positioning). Andy would cap this when you break position (not when you get fatigued). One of the tests Peter does with patients is to see how long they can hold a full 90-degree squat (with the thigh parallel to the ground). 2 minutes is excellent. You don’t fail when you give up, but when you make a compensatory movement (shoot your butt out or lunge forward). This is a great test of strength without having to put people at risk.",

Switch it up each day at the gym, using any of the above. Next, move into strength training. Keep a structure of total body workouts on all three days but vary the rep range. Monday: 3-4 sets of 5-7 reps using heavier weights (aim for a RPE of 7-8; rest 1.5 minutes in between). Wednesday: 15-20 reps per set. Friday: do something like isometrics where you’re just holding different positions. All three are equally effective for hypertrophy. End the workout by targeting either the thing you hate doing or an area you want to grow. At least one of these days, touch a high heart rate. End each workout with two minutes of something that gets the heart rate close to its maximum (many options are discussed including breath holds).",
