And how do you do this in a way that minimizes the side effects of that?\n\nBecause for some people to lower ApoB that much is trivial — Peter takes a PCSK9 inhibitor and a statin and he can basically eradicate it \nBut for some people, statins are difficult to tolerate\n\nAbout 5% of the population has intractable muscle soreness and that appears to be the case regardless of which statin you use and we tend to rotate through different statins\n\n\nPeter likes to start patients with rosuvastatin or pravastatin\nIf they have difficulties there, move to pitavastatin (Livalo)\nBut if people can’t tolerate any of those things, today we have so many other options\n\nIf they’re a hyper absorber we would use ezetimibe\nif they’re a hyper synthesizer, but can’t respond to statins, we use mefenamic acid\n\n\n“We have lots of tools up our sleeve today more than ever before and that’s why I just think we should be more and more aggressive on this now.”\n\n§"
