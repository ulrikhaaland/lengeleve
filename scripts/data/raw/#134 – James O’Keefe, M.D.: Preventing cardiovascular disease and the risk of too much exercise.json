Unless you have an MI [heart attack], you don’t need to be going in having procedures, stents electively. We have the tools.”\n \nUnderstanding atherosclerosis and the misconception that it’s a “plumbing problem” [10:15]\nBalloon angioplasty and stents\n\nCoronary arteries are narrow – the left coronary artery for example is less than a half centimeter or a third of an inch wide\nDuring angioplasty, a catheter with a deflated balloon is inserted into the narrowing artery and the balloon is inflated with saline to restore flow\nIn some cases, a stent is left behind to preserve the opening\nIn cases of asymptomatic blockage, there is no evidence of benefit for stents (and only some evidence of benefit in an acute MI situation)\nYet, stents are used frequently — \n\npartly because of the economic incentive to do the procedure\nBut also because of this flawed paradigm: That this it’s a “plumbing” issue\n\n\n\nThe flawed paradigm is this: That blocked arteries are simply a plumbing issue—\n\nThe thinking is …“You have blockages in your arteries. Well, duh. You get rid of the clog. That’s simple.”\nBut in reality, “As logical as that is, it doesn’t really turn out to be true.”\n\n⇒ For more on the overuse of stents, see episode of The Drive with Ethan Weiss\nThe zit analogy for explaining atherosclerosis/cardiovascular disease:\n\nSimilar in concept to a pimple or pustule, atherosclerosis starts with accumulation of oxidized triglycerides and LDL cholesterol that attracts monocytes and macrophages\nThe monocytes and macrophages promote inflammation and thin the overlying collagen layer, facilitating rupture and subsequent development of scar tissue\nIn response to rupture, platelets and fibrinogen accumulate into a thrombus (blood clot)\nCalcification of the arterial tissue is part of the healing process\nAngioplasty is useful for opening a blocked artery during a heart attack, but causes further damage in the process\n\nThis is the basis for why James believes a preventative approach (i.e., lifestyle change) is more appropriate for asymptomatic cases\n\n\n\nContext around what calcification and a calcium score really means:\nPeter’s “bars on the window” analogy:\n\nOne of Peter’s patients had a calcium score of ~100, which put him at the 75th to 90th percentile of risk for his age\nIn the three locations primarily affected, he had 30% to 50% blockage\nPeter points out that this blockage and calcification is like bars on a window – it does not indicate that a break-in is about to happen, but rather that it is a bad neighborhood and that a break-in likely occurred in the past\n“It’s telling us that now is the time to act and add other agents to our toolkit for how we’re going to prevent myocardial death.”\n\nAssessment of coronary arterial calcification\n\nJames uses an inexpensive ($50 per test) and low-radiation CT scan called CardioScan to measure coronary arterial calcification\nHe believes that for men over age 40 and women over age 60, CardioScan is the equivalent of the mammogram for the heart (i.e., everyone should have one)\nJames has seen cases where coronary arterial calcification exceeds calcification of the spine!\nPredisposition to arterial calcification is partly genetic, but in James’ words is “a highly modifiable process”\n\n“We can’t make the acne scars go away. They’re there forever once you have those calcium deposits. But we can pretty much make the risk go away. That’s why prevention is just so effective and so instrumental.”\n<img decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14486\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/anatomy-of-the-heart-okeefe-1024x608.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"608\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/anatomy-of-the-heart-okeefe-1024x608.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/anatomy-of-the-heart-okeefe-300x178.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/anatomy-of-the-heart-okeefe-768x456.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/anatomy-of-the-heart-okeefe-1536x912.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/anatomy-of-the-heart-okeefe.png 1900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 1.

With extreme amounts of exercise, this stretching of the heart can be problematic\n\nOxidative stress of exercise\n\nIn addition, exercise creates oxidative stress. After about 45 to 50 minutes of high-intensity exercise, the body’s antioxidant capacity to resolve the oxidative stress is exhausted and endothelial function is negatively affected at this point \nThis coincides with increased blood levels of troponins and the N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP), which are both markers of heart damage\n\nDial it back as you age\n\nEspecially after age 40 or 45, really protracted exercise will cause those small little micro damage, like overstretching and tearing\nThis happens because the high levels of catecholamines and free radicals that are now unbuffered\n\n“If you want to run a marathon, fine, run one or two. It’s like climbing Mount Everest, if you ever do that, do it once, but don’t do it three times a year. . . you’ve got to move on to healthier forms of exercise.”\nLongevity versus performance\n\nA Formula One car is fast and powerful – it will perform at peak levels, but is not going to last for 500,000 miles  \nIn contrast, a car that can last 500,000 miles is going to be more like a Honda Accord that has been well maintained and never driven faster than 70 mph.\nIn short, longevity and performance are different goals\nIn regard to health, James notes that if you want to run a marathon or do something similar for the sake of accomplishment, that is fine, but it should not become a regular habit\nPeter notes how some of his patients find purpose and/or comradery in extreme exercise and it is sometimes a struggle for them to embrace the tradeoff\n\nIt took Peter three years to embrace the tradeoff himself\n\n\nJames experienced this tradeoff himself—He competed in triathlons up until his mid forties, when he started noticing concerns with his heart rhythm, including premature ventricular and atrial contractions and supraventricular tachycardia \n\nPremature ventricular contractions can be caused by the high levels of catecholamines and oxidative stress produced during prolonged intense exercise, resulting in fibrosis and scar tissue that can disrupt heart rhythm and facilitate development of atrial fibrillation\n\n\nA Harvard study by one of the “godfathers of the exercise movement” showed that the people who exercised the most lost 38% of the longevity benefit compared to those who exercised more moderately\nKen Cooper, one of the founding fathers of modern aerobics once said, “If you’re running more than 15 miles a week, you’re doing it for some other reason besides health.”\nFurther demonstrating the concerns of excessive exercise, professional cyclists have been shown to be more likely to develop atrial fibrillation\n\n \nThe story of Micah True—a case study of excessive exercise [49:15]\nMicah True\n\nHe was an ultra-distance runner and is the subject of the popular book, Born to Run\nHe frequently ran 50-100 mile races in the desert heat\nAt the age of 58, he died suddenly while running \nAn autopsy of his heart revealed scarring of the atria and ventricles, particularly the right ventricle and the interventricular septum\n\nEvidence supporting the reverse J-shaped curve\n\nSince it is not practical to do randomized controlled trials on longevity for humans, the supporting data is primarily epidemiological\nExperimental studies, however, have been done in dogs and mice, and they have shown excessive exercise to result in dilated heart chambers \nJames recently published a review paper describing 10 large epidemiological studies, and all but two showed a very distinct reverse J-shaped curve for exercise dose and mortality \n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14488\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reverse-J-curve-for-exercise-okeefe-1024x551.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reverse-J-curve-for-exercise-okeefe-1024x551.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reverse-J-curve-for-exercise-okeefe-300x161.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reverse-J-curve-for-exercise-okeefe-768x413.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reverse-J-curve-for-exercise-okeefe-1536x826.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reverse-J-curve-for-exercise-okeefe.png 1662w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 2.

Image credit: O’Keefe et al., 2020\n \nThe best kinds of exercise for longevity—The Copenhagen City Heart Study [53:00] \nThe Copenhagen City Heart Study\n\nNearly 10,000 Danes were followed for more than 20 years\nThis study is the equivalent of the Framingham study, but for exercise\nParticipants were grouped based on type of physical activity, including running, cycling, swimming, “health club activities” (i.e., exercising at a gym), tennis, badminton, and soccer\nJames was shocked by the results – tennis, badminton, and soccer were associated with the greatest longevity benefit, followed by running, cycling, calisthenics, and swimming \nAs demonstrated in a meta-analysis, research has shown that social relationships are as important for predicting longevity as other well-established factors such as smoking and exercise\nBased on this, James believes that the benefits of activities like tennis, badminton, and soccer are that they “combine two medicines instead of one” by combining exercise with social interaction\nA major limitation of the Copenhagen study (and any multivariate analysis) is that \n\n1) A lot of variables can’t be teased out\n2) You don’t have the ability to closely understand the intervention—in this case there is tremendous variation in how the activities are being carried out, particularly in the “health club activities” category\n\n\n\n“… if you’re training for longevity, yeah, take it down a couple of notches, but also make sure that you have some play in your life. We played as kids, we need to be playing as adults even more because it’s so important, not only for social bonding from stress relief or antidepressant.”\n \nBeing a more balanced athlete and finding the right exercise intensity [58:45]\nThe “opportunity cost” of extreme exercise and the need for balance\n\nPeter uses lost time as an argument against excessive exercise\nFor example, running 50 miles per week requires so much time that does not leave adequate times for other important types of exercise such as strength training\nIt also leaves less time to spend with family\nPeter notes that “life is a pretty complicated sport and it requires strength, stability, aerobic fitness, and anaerobic fitness.”\nJames recommends things that will keep resting heart rate low, but also some high-intensity interval training to maintain maximal capacity, “high volumes are really high intensity exercise is just not the ideal approach to fitness”\n\n“… after 30 or 45 minutes of aerobic exercise, if you want to do more circle back home and do some yoga, do some weights, these things that don’t necessarily tax your heart the same way that the other high intensity sports do.”\nFinding the right exercise intensity\n\nPeter describes the importance of zone 2 aerobic exercise, which is done at a relatively low intensity, but approximately the highest intensity prior to mitochondrial capacity being exceeded and lactate accumulation increasing\nZone 2 exercise was discussed in great depth in podcast episode 85 with Iñigo San Millán\nPeter also notes that most people do not spend not enough time at this intensity and spend too much time at intensities between zone 2 and maximal intensity\nA rough ratio should be 80% zone 2 and 20% zone 5 (i.e., max capacity)\nHe believes this middle area of intensity (zones 3-4) is the least important zone to be training within\n\n \nHeart rate during exercise, resting heart rate, and other important metrics [1:04:00]\nJames is often asked, “What should your heart rate be during exercise?”\n\nJames actually recommends that people not pay much attention to heart rate during exercise\nInstead, the most important parameters about pulse are:\n\nResting HR—We want to get that nice and low\nHeart rate variability—\n\nwe want that to be more variable when you take slow deep breaths\nThis is why meditation or yoga is a really good thing to add to somebody’s fitness regimen\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14487\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/HRV-okeefe-1024x520.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/HRV-okeefe-1024x520.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/HRV-okeefe-300x152.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/HRV-okeefe-768x390.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/HRV-okeefe.png 1316w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 3.

Association between steps per day and all-cause mortality. Image credit: Saint-Maurice et al., 2020\nInterpreting resting heart rate\nWhat plays a role in resting HR?\n\nPeter has noticed variation in the resting heart rate of his patients and wonders to what extent genetics is a contributing factor\nAt equivalent fitness levels, women tend to have higher fasting heart rates than men\nA lower resting heart rate is associated with increased longevity\nLater in life, sick sinus syndrome can lower heart rate\nAlcohol consumption, stress, and inadequate sleep can all increase resting heart rate\n\nAs a marker of health status\n\nJames notices that lifestyle factors like overtraining, poor sleep, a lot of travel, stress, and illness will typically increase his resting heart rate by 5 or more beats per minute\nIn James’ practice, it is common for his patients to lower their resting heart rate by 5-10 beats per minute through lifestyle intervention\nGreater decreases require serious commitment to losing weight, exercising, and getting fit\n\nDrops in resting heart rate are often accompanied by decreases in abdominal fat, blood pressure, triglycerides, and hemoglobin A1c\n\n\n\n \nNutrition for cardiovascular health [1:09:45]\nJame’s experience with traditional dietary recommendations\n\nWhen he was in medical school (1980s), low-fat diets like the Pritikin Diet were very popular\nThis type of diet was a “disaster” for him:\n\nTriglycerides increased from 80 to 300\nHDL-C decreased from 50 to 33\nHis athletic performance declined\nOverall, he was not feeling as well\n\n\n\nThe Mediterranean diet\n\nJames believes that a Meditteranean diet emphasizing fish and minimization of refined carbohydrates, combined with intermittent fasting, is the best dietary approach for cardiovascular health\n\nHe recently published a review article on this topic\n\n\nHe also believes that this dietary approach is also beneficial for preventing diabetes, dementia, obesity, and other common chronic diseases\nPeter and James agree that PREDIMED is a landmark nutrition study \n\nThis study was a randomized controlled trial that not only found a Mediterrenean diet to decrease risk of major cardiovascular events by about 30%, but showed decreased risk of diabetes, cognitive decline, and obesity in followup studies\nInterestingly, it was the added fat from olive oil and nuts that correlated best with the observed benefits\n\n\nJames believes that a ketogenic diet should be structured more like a Mediterranean diet – it should emphasize fat from nuts, seeds, extra virgin olive oil, avocados, and oily fish over foods like cream cheese, butter, and red meat\n\n“… a diet that’s moderately high in fat, very low in refined carbohydrates, almost no added sugar, and minimal white refined grains but high in nuts and extra virgin olive oil and high in fish and seafood and high in vegetables and low in processed food, and drinking mostly water tea, coffee, fasting for at least 12 hours each 24-hour period of time and preferably moving to a 14- or 16-hour fast per day, we think this is arguably the healthiest cardiovascular diet.”\nNuances of olive oil\n\nAs suggested by Emilio Ros, the primary investigator for the PREDIMED study, the benefits of olive oil depend on it being extra virgin and having high polyphenol content  \n\nThis type of olive oil should give a sensation at the back of the throat similar to black pepper\n\n\nOne study found olive oil to have a negative effect on endothelial function, and according to James, this is because a high-polyphenol olive oil was not used\nPeter points out how consumers need to be aware – sometimes even products labeled as extra virgin olive oil are really nothing more than canola oil with some olive oil mixed in\n\nSaturated fat\n\nPeter notes that the epidemiology is confounded by people who consume more saturated fat typically also consuming unhealthy ingredients like refined carbohydrates\nJames believes that a moderate amount of saturated fat is part of our evolutionary history, but that an excessive amount is not a good idea\nThat said, he believes that sugar and other refined carbohydrates are a much greater concern\n\n“… that is again, our evolutionary history. We ate a lot of red meat and we ate saturated fats. The evil white crystal in the American diet is not salt. The worst is sugar. And sugar and refined carbohydrates are by far the absolute worst dietary villain. Saturated fat… A little bit of butter is not going to kill you.”\n \nImportant nutrients: Magnesium, potassium, calcium, sodium, and collagen [1:19:30]\nMagnesium and Potassium\n\nPeter is a strong proponent of magnesium:\n\nPeter likes it in the form of oxide combined with a slow mag\nPeter finds that supplementing magnesium on the order of two grams of magnesium a day almost always makes his patients feel better\n\n\nJames points out that our evolutionary ancestors were getting about five times more magnesium and potassium (and fiber)\n\nPart of the reason for this is that they ate “nose to tail”\n\n\nMagnesium is an important cofactor for many reactions in the body\nNuts are a good source of magnesium\nJames also agrees with 2 g/d of magnesium as the right amount\n\nCalcium\n\nEating “nose to tail” includes cooking bone, which provides calcium hydroxyapatite, which James says is a more appropriate form to eat\nStandard calcium supplements are in the form of calcium carbonate and calcium gluconate, which James says “… are rocks. We didn’t eat rocks. We ate bones.”\nJames believes that 1 g/d of calcium is a good target\n\nCollagen\n\nOur ancestors consumed more collagen based on cooking bone and eating animal skin\nSince this is no longer common practice, James believes that collagen supplementation is valuable\nJames points out that collagen is beneficial for hair, skin, nails, and bones; \nAnd it is even beneficial for building and maintaining muscle mass b/c of the glycine and other amino acids\n\nSodium\n\nJames notes the need to be careful with sodium intake for people with heart failure and kidney disease\nDespite this, he rarely recommends that people limit sodium to less than 1,500 mg/d and believes that 2,000 – 3,000 mg/d is a better target\nWhen following a diet based on whole foods, James recommends salting to taste since these foods are low in sodium\n\n \nSGLT2 inhibition for diabetes, cardio-protection, and general longevity [1:24:15]\nBackground\n\nSGLT2 inhibitors are a class of drugs that blocks sodium glucose co-transporter 2 in the tubule of kidney cells\nThis basically blocks reabsorption of glucose, resulting in increased excretion of glucose through the urine\n\nFor this reason, SGLT2 inhibitors are used to treat diabetes\n\n\n\nSurprising benefits\n\nEMPA-REG, the first large clinical trial on an SGLT2 inhibitor, showed a decrease in heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular deaths in type 2 diabetics\nMore trials have been done, confirming this benefit and also showing decreased risk of kidney failure, even in non-diabetics\n\nSGLT2 inhibitors for longevity\n\nPeter is interested in the potential of SGLT2 inhibition as an alternative to metformin for promoting longevity\nThere is evidence of metformin impairing benefit from exercise, which does not appear to happen with SGLT2 inhibition\n\nJames adds…\n\nJames prescribes SGLT2 inhibitors to all of his type 2 diabetic patients\nBut even for a non-diabetic person, you urinate out about a hundred grams of sugar a day\n“This basically is like pulling the plug and draining a substantial amount of sugar from your body every day.” \nIt raises ketones in your system—it taps into belly fat to get the fatty acids that then the liver turns into ketones\n\n“… we still don’t fully understand how it [SGLT2 inhibition] works, but it’s an important drug class that is going to only get bigger with respect to its impact on health and longevity.” \nWhy doesn’t it result in urinary tract infections?\n\nBy increasing urinary excretion of glucose, SGLT2 inhibition could be expected to increase urinary tract infections, but this has not been the case\nJames, however, has noticed increased frequency of yeast infections in women\n\nHe recommends using a wet wipe after urination to help prevent this\n\n\n\nThe role of insulin in the benefits of lowering glucose\n\nPeter points out that lowering glucose in type 2 diabetics only decreases cardiovascular mortality when the decrease in glucose is achieved without an increase in insulin\nJames refers to the Drive podcast episode with Jason Fung while describing insulin as an obesity-promoting hormone that accelerates atherosclerosis when present at high levels\n\nFor this reason, he considers insulin therapy to be a last resort for type 2 diabetics\n\n\nJames co-authored a review paper describing evidence of insulin therapy increasing cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetics\nHe also notes that part of the reason why other drugs for diabetics have cardiovascular benefit is through decreasing insulin\n\n \nGLP-1 agonists for weight loss and reducing cardiovascular risk [1:34:15]\nGLP-1 agonists\n\nGLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is a hormone that promotes insulin secretion and tends to decline in type 2 diabetics\nAccording to James, GLP-1 decreases glucagon production in the liver, thereby decreasing glucose production\nGLP-1 agonists lower fasting insulin and increase postprandial insulin\nJames believes that GLP-1 agonists are great for weight loss and prescribes them accordingly\n\nConstipation and/or nausea may occur initially, but are likely to disappear over time\nIn his patients, high-dose semaglutide results in weight loss of up to 10% of body weight\nIn non-diabetics, he combines GLP-1 agonists with SGLT2 inhibitors\n\n\nLiraglutide is currently approved by the FDA for weight loss (for use once per day) and semaglutide is expected to be approved in the next year (for use once per week)\n\nDespite the lower frequency (once per week), semaglutide has been shown in multiple studies to be more effective for weight loss and reduction of hemoglobin A1c. Cardiovascular benefit is greater as well\nJames notes that semaglutide is even an alternative to bariatric surgery\n\n\nJames believes that GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors make a great combination because they promote weight loss and decrease cardiovascular risk through separate mechanisms (and are safe)\n\n \nStatins—mechanism of action, safety, and useful alternatives [1:37:25]\n\nPeter notes that although statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis, their benefit is more likely a result of increasing the LCL receptor in the liver\nAs an example of statins having pleiotropic benefit, James points out a study showing statin use to be associated with less severe COVID-19 infection\n\nThis might be related to the anti-inflammatory effect statins are known to have\n\n\nDespite the large amount of evidence on efficacy of statins, Peter and James share their experience in having to defend against patients’ concerns about their use\n\nThis is likely driven by misinformation on the internet\nWhile loss of coenzyme Q10 and associated muscle pain are legitimate concerns, they can be easily resolved through supplementation\nJames mentions ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors as alternatives to statins that do not interfere with cholesterol synthesis (as discussed in the latest Drive episode with Tom Dayspring)\n\nThe association with decreased brain cholesterol with dementia is a good reason to considering alternatives to statin therapy (including a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids)\nFor this reason, Peter measures desmosterol and lathosterol as markers of cholesterol synthesis in his patients, and is particularly cautious with patients who have one or two copies of APOE-4\n\n\n\n\n\n \nA 40-year view on cardiovascular risk, and the possibility of reversing arterial calcification [1:45:45]\n10-year cardiovascular risk\n\nIf someone has a low 10-year risk calculation but has high ApoB, current recommendations are to do nothing beyond lifestyle modifications\nBased on the work of Allan Sniderman, Peter thinks it is more important to look at 30- or 40- year risk\nJames notes that ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors are actually preferable to statins in this context because statins can accelerate coronary artery calcification\nPeter personally takes a low dose pravastatin plus PCSK9 inhibitor, but is considering doing the experiment of switching to from pravastatin over to Zetia to see what changes\n\nRegression of coronary artery calcification\n\nPeter notes his calcium score of 6 at age 36\n\nPeter suggests it was most likely attributable to a poor diet\nJames thinks that the high volume of high intensity exercise also played a role\n\n\nPeter has since decreased his calcium score to 0\n\nJames says you virtually never see scores go down—he has read about 150,000 calcium scores and considers this rare – calcium score usually increases by 25-30% or more per year\nIn one of James’ patients, however, he saw a calcium score over 1,000 drop by 200-300 after switching from statins to ezetimibe plus a PCSK9 inhibitor\n\nA recent study showed that using a PCSK9 inhibitor with a statin results in less coronary artery calcification than a statin alone\n\n\n\n\nPeter and James agree that re-testing calcium score is generally not necessary\n\nAlthough it may serve as motivation for patients who are not following recommendations, it can be discouraging for patients who are doing everything right\n\n\n\n“…we can prevent cardiovascular events with all these strategies we’re talking about, despite the coronary calcium.”\n \nEvidence for high dose EPA and DHA for the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk [1:53:30]\nBackground on omega-3 fatty acids\n\nSimilar to other nutrients, James notes that we’re eating less omega-3 fatty acids than our evolutionary ancestors, maybe by an order of magnitude\nSome people believe that access to shellfish and seafood corresponded with human brain expansion 300,000-400,000 years ago\nAbout twenty percent of the brain’s dry weight is made of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from neuron membranes.\n\nEvidence supporting a decrease in cardiovascular risk from omega-3s\n\nThe REDUCE-IT trial showed 4 g/d of a purified form of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to decrease cardiovascular deaths and events in people with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or risk factors including high triglycerides by 20%\nAnother recent trial, the EVAPORATE study, showed 4 g/d of the same purified form of EPA to decrease coronary plaque by 17%\nThe STRENGTH trial, however, looked at the effects of 4 g/d of a fish oil derivative including EPA+DHA on cardiovascular outcomes and was terminated early due to expected lack of effect\nA recent meta-analysis of 40 studies found EPA+DHA to decrease cardiovascular death and events\n\nRisk of fatal myocardial infarction was decreased by 35%\nOverall risk decreased by 5.8% for each additional gram per day of EPA+DHA (max dose evaluated was less than 6 g)\n\n\nJames believes that dosage is important – 2 to 4 g/d produces impressive results while most studies that fail to find benefit have used lower doses\nAlthough it is not clearly known if EPA is better alone or in combination with DHA, James believes it is logical to include DHA based on its role in the brain and that we consumed EPA and DHA together throughout our evolutionary history\n\nSources of omega-3s\n\nPeter and James agree that diet, particularly oily fish, is the best source of omega-3s\nPeter recommends Carlson as a supplemental source of omega-3 based on a third party lab analysis he had done\nJames is Chief Medical Officer for a company named CardioTabs that produces high-quality omega-3 supplements sourced from Scandinavia\n\n \nThe impact of omega-3, curcumin, and other compounds on mental health and dementia [1:59:00]\nPotential cognitive benefits of omega-3 and curcumin\n\nJames believes that omega-3 supplementation is cheap and safe, with profound benefits that can help keep people off of antidepressant medications\nJames recently published a review with Richard Isaacson describing the TNF-α-lowering benefit of highly-absorbable curcumin (Theracurmin) for preventing Alzheimer’s disease\n\nHe points out that there is observational data on millions of people suggesting that TNF-α inhibition decreases Alzheimer’s risk by 60-70% (this data is reviewed in the publication above)\n\n\nThe Alzheimer’s risk factors Peter has identified with Richard Isaacson (as discussed in Drive episode 18):\n\nAge above 60 years\nFamily history of Alzheimer’s disease\nPresence of the APOE-4 gene\nConsideration of additional genes associated with Alzheimer’s, including anti-TNF genes and TOMM40\n\n\nConsistent with James’ paper above, Peter includes Theracurmin in his approach for Alzheimer’s prevention\n\n“Upwards of like 90% of Americans aren’t getting enough omega-3 in their diet and it correlates with depression, ADHD, suicide, cognition, dementia, all those things … this is like a super easy way to markedly improve mental health.”\n \nJames’ focus beyond cardiology [2:02:15]\nHow James progressed from being a “cath jockey” to caring about things like curcumin and Alzheimer’s prevention\n\nJames simply “followed his heart” and says that he loves what he does to the extent that he would still do it without pay\nFor people aspiring to be medical professionals who focus on prevention, James advises that it does not have to be all or nothing – you can be involved in the more standard and reactive aspects of medicine, such as angioplasty and lipid lowering, but you can limit this to just a portion of your focus\n\nJames also points out that working in a large medical group makes it easier for him to carve out his own niche\n\n\nJames believes that prevention will become a more important part of medicine as more people realize the payoff in regard to getting more out of life\n\n“… this whole world is set up to minimize activity and maximize calorie consumption, but there’s also people who are paying close attention and we have all of these powerful tools and use this information to help each other and to live not only longer, but more sort of active and fulfilling and enjoyable lives.”\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialEpisode of The
