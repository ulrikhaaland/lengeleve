  "title": "#179 – Jeremy Loenneke, Ph.D.: The science of blood flow restriction—benefits, uses, and what it teaches us about the relationship between muscle size and strength",
  "content": "Jeremy Loenneke has a Ph.D. in exercise physiology, a Master’s in nutrition and exercise, and is currently the director of the Kevser Ermin Applied Physiology Laboratory at the University of Mississippi, where he focuses his research on skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise in combination with blood flow restriction (BFR). In this episode, Jeremy explains the science of BFR and the mechanisms by which BFR training can produce hypertrophy using low loads. Here, he reviews anatomy and terminology of muscle structure and discusses the evidence that increasing muscular strength may not be dependent on increasing muscle size. Additionally, Jeremy goes into depth on how one might take advantage of BFR training, including practical applications for athletes and average people, as well as the situations for which BFR training would be most advantageous.\n*WATCH PODCAST ON YOUTUBE*\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#179 - Jeremy Loenneke, Ph.D.: The science of blood flow restriction—benefits, uses, and what it teaches us about the relationship between muscle size and strength\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#179 - Jeremy Loenneke, Ph.D.: The science of blood flow restriction—benefits, uses, and what it teaches us about the relationship between muscle size and strength\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#179 - Jeremy Loenneke, Ph.D.: The science of blood flow restriction—benefits, uses, and what it teaches us about the relationship between muscle size and strength\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nJeremy’s interest in exercise and weightlifting and his scientific training [3:30];\nThe microstructure and physiology of muscle [8:00];\nDefinitions of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers [12:45];\nComparison of strength vs. hypertrophy [21:30];\nBlood flow restriction training and the origins of the Kaatsu system [28:30];\nThe details and metrics related to exercise under blood flow restriction [44:45];\nConsiderations when training with blood flow restriction: loading, pace, rest, and risks [53:00];\nBlood flow restriction studies and the relationship between muscle size and muscle strength [1:04:15];\nEvidence that increasing muscular strength is not dependent on increasing the size of the muscle [1:16:30];\nPractical applications of blood flow restriction training for athletes and average people [1:27:30];\nSituations in which blood flow restriction training is most advantageous [1:35:30];\nThe mechanisms by which blood flow restriction training can produce so much hypertrophy at such low loads [1:39:45];\nApplications of “passive” blood flow restriction training [1:47:15];\nWhat experiments would Jeremy do if he had unlimited resources?

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

Jeremy started training with him\n\nIt helped a little with wrestling\n\n\nHe began reading muscle magazines and focused on exercise  science early on in undergrad\n\n\n\n\nHe wanted to know how to make a muscle bigger, how to make it stronger\n\nJeremy’s scientific training\n\nAt first he wanted to work with athletes, but upon trying it, he didn’t like it and turned to research\n\nHe had a mindset that everybody was going to train and train hard and he found a mismatch between his expectations the athletes he worked with\n\n\nHe landed at the University of Illinois and that’s where he met Lane and a couple of other people\n\nThat’s where he really came came across blood flow restriction and focus his time on this; this was around 2007-2008\nHe got into human research\n\n\nHe did his PhD at the University of Oklahoma\n\nHis dissertation focused on different methods of applying blood flow restriction?\n\nHe evaluated the acute response of different exercise loads of 20%, 30%, under different pressures\n\n\n\n\nHe took a job at Ole Miss, The University of Mississippi \n\n \nThe microstructure and physiology of muscle [8:00]\nThe anatomy of a muscle\n\nMuscles are made of tubular fibers called myofibrils, shown in the figure below\nThe smallest unit is a sarcomere\n\nThis is the repeating unit between 2 Z-lines (aka Z discs)\nMyofibrils are composed of repeating units of sarcomeres\nSarcomeres are made up of alternating thin and thick filaments \n\nThe thin filaments are made of actin, shown in green below\nThe thick filaments are made of myosin, shown in purple below\n\n\nActin and myosin are both proteins\n\nExercise results in the production of more actin and myosin\nMuscle will get bigger when more actin and myosin is made than is broken down \n\n\nActin and myosin interact to cause muscle contraction;

Sliding filament model of muscle contraction.  Image credit: OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology\n\nPeter notes that ATP is required to release the actin-myosin complex, and this explains rigor mortis\n\nA dead person cannot make ATP; they don’t have the ability to release the actin myosin filaments\n\nThis is why a body gets stiff\n\n\n\n\nThere is a continuum of muscle fibers; the terms fast twitch and slow twitch are used\n\nThe faster twitch muscle has a higher contractile force, but it fatigues quickly\n\n\n\n \nDefinitions of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers [12:45]\nClarify fast twitch and slow twitch muscle fibers\n\nDo they all twitch at the same speed? \n\n\nFaster muscle fibers have a higher contractile force but fatigues quickly\n\n\nIs the difference in muscle types a difference in the neurologic signal or difference in the speed of contraction?\n\n\nThe work of Andy Galpin and others addresses this question\n\nReview article from 2020 Moving human muscle physiology research forward: an evaluation of fiber type-specific protein research methodologies\nOld methods of studying this have limits\nStudies depend on how the fibers are actually identified and the methodology\n\n\n\nMore on classifying muscle fibers\n\nAn explanation of the types of muscle fibers is summarized in the book Skeletal Muscle: Form and Function \nMuscle fiber types are classified according to the myosin heavy chain  isoforms (MHC) they contain; this can be type I, IIA, IIB, and IIX\n\nI or II designates the fiber type\nThey have different physiologic and staining properties, classified into 3 major groups:\n\n\n\n\nType I are slow twitch, produce the smallest force, and are resistant to fatigue\nType IIA are fast twitch, produce a larger force, and are resistant to fatigue\nType IIX (aka Type IIB) are fast twitch, produce the largest force, and are easily fatigued\n\n\nA, B, or X designates the myosin heavy chain isoform\n\n\nIn general, type IIX are bigger and stronger, but fatigue much faster\nType IIA are more oxidative, they’re forceful and can sustain contraction for longer\nExercise causes type IIX to transition to type IIA; there’s not a lot of type IIX leftover\nType I fibers are a little slower and not as forceful, but they don’t fatigue easily\n\nDifferences in contractile strength between a type I and type IIX fiber\n\nThe type I fiber has lots of mitochondria surrounding the myofibrils within the sarcomere\n\nIt can readily access energy via oxidation of glucose and fatty acids using aerobic respiration\n\n\nThe type IIX fiber lacks mitochondria surrounding it\n\nIt’s restricted to anaerobic respiration, converting glucose to lactate using anaerobic glycolysis \n\n\n\nWhat accounts mechanically for the difference between these 2 fibers?\n\nMost people would say the overall size difference\n\nIn young people, the size of the fiber is distinctly different\nFiber mechanics are different and how they interact within the body is also important\n\n\n\nIs the capacity for aerobic work versus explosive strength (anaerobic work) genetically set?\n\nThis is difficult to determine because may studies extrapolate from small bits of fibers\nAthletes thought to have some of the greatest endurance capacities are cross-country skiers.\n\nMany of them have a predominance of type I fibers\n\nThe question is, were they born this way (and that’s why they gravitated to this sport) or was there a shift in fiber type with training; it’s probably both\n\n\n\n\nThere probably is a large genetic component to both the baseline amount of fiber types and also the body’s response to exercise\n\nHow does training impact fiber type?\n\nConsider a wiry person who can’t put on muscle no matter what they do, but get them out on a bike and you can’t catch them\nSome, but training won’t take an average athlete and make them an elite athlete\n\nOne could move up a few notches\n\n\nThe tools are lacking to discriminate individuals who are highly responsive to training and those that are not\n\n \nComparison of strength vs. hypertrophy [21:30]\n\nExercise causes a muscle to get bigger\nMeasure one’s biceps crudely with a tape measure or more more accurately with an MRI or ultrasound; then compare the size after 6 months of prescribed exercises\n\nWhy does the muscle get bigger after exercise?  What happened in that cycle of hypertrophy?\n\nThere could be an increase in fiber size, this is hypertrophy\n\nThe muscle cells themselves increase in size\n\n\nThe number of cells in the muscle could also increase, this is hyperplasia\n\nHyperplasia is not thought to play a big role in increased muscle size in adults \nWe can’t rule it out, but there isn’t much evidence for it\n\n\nChanges in muscle size are thought to be due to hypertrophy; increased cell size\n\nIt’s assumed this increase in cell size is due to increased overall protein (actin, myosin, etc.) and other components that help support the cell\n\n\nPeter notes that muscle cells are unique in this characteristic of changing in size\n\nOther cells don’t do this\nA Dermatologist looking at moles, biopsies them don’t really look at the cell size\n\nConcern in this scenario would be if hyperplasia, metaplasia, or dysplasia were observed\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the actin and myosin complex change in size or if there are simply more of these proteins?\n\nShort-term measures of protein synthesis show more overall actin and myosin, along with other things\n\nStrength\n\n\n\nThere is mechanical strength and neurologic strength\nIf one measures the ability to do a bicep curl, there’ll be 2 measurements\n\nThe maximum weight lifted in a single rep (single rep max)\nThe maximum weight lifted a set number of times (measure of endurance)\n\n\nFor example, someone does the same exercises over 6 months and sees a 20% increase in the weight used for a single rep max and and 15% increase in the amount of weight moved 10 times; explain what happened for this strength change\n\nThe initial change in strength is thought to be due to neurological changes\n\nThe signal sent from the brain, through the spinal cord, to the alpha motor neuron\n\nThe alpha motor neuron is the nerve that communicates with the muscle\nThere could be changes anywhere in this pathway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith more excitatory input there is less inhibition; the thresholds that makes it easier to fire the type II fiber is lowered\n\n\n\n\nAfter 3-4 weeks of training, the muscle get bigger; the change in fiber size will also contribute to a change in strength\n\n\n\n\nThis is something Jeremy’s work has taken some exception to \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublication: Is muscle growth a mechanism for increasing strength (Loenneke et al. 2019)\n\n\n\n\nPeter relates the common dogma that muscle size relates to strength because the size increase comes from more actin and myosin; so with more contractile units, strength increases \n\nJeremy’s work calls this dogma into question\n\nThere is a neural component to increases in strength but also changes at the local level that can explain changes in strength\n\nThere may be changes at the myosin head or changes in calcium release that occur when strength is increased\n\nThere isn’t any good evidence for this yet, but this is his idea behind why someone may get stronger following exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBlood flow restriction training and the origins of the Kaatsu system [28:30]\nPeter’s experience with blood flow restriction exercise  \n\nHe used to swim a lot, 10 year ago his friend Steve Munatones (a world-class marathon swimmer) visited him for a swim workout; after the workout Steve brought out these Kaatsu bands and asked Peter to put them on his thighs, upper thighs, arms, and upper arms for compression\nSteve had what looked like a blood pressure cuff that he could use to calibrate the occlusive pressure\nHe asked Peter to to swim a 50 yard butterfly all out\n\nA request that is challenging under any circumstances but doable; he could do a set of 10 50’s at 90% with 45 seconds in between and be fine\nPeter remembers this being the hardest thing he has ever done; it felt harder than swimming 200 yards of butterfly; he felt like he was going to die\nThis piqued his curiosity with this technique but he didn’t have the equipment and forgot about the technique until recently\n\n\n\nOrigin of the Kaatsu system\n\nYoshiaki Sato came up with the Kaatsu system \nLegend has it that Yoshiaki was kneeling at a Buddhist ceremony and felt a little numbness, a sensation similar to what he felt doing heavy squats, and he thought there could be some connection there\n\nKneeling was restricting his blood flow \n\n\nHe was interested in bodybuilding\nThis led him to begin experimenting with different ways to restrict blood flow in his lower body and upper body\nSome stories day he actually harmed himself a little because he was maybe applying it too tightly\nHe had a skiing accident and used blood flow restriction during his rehab and saw what he thought was pretty good gains\nUltimately, he found that one can use very light weights (low loads) that make it feel like lifting very, very heavy weights\n\nThis is obviously useful if someone had a skiing accident or doesn’t want to lift heavy weights because of some sort of injury\n\n\nResearch on blood flow restriction and exercise began to be published in the  late ’90s, early 2000s\nPeter relates the experience of one of his patient’s last year who had a complete tear in his bicep, underwent surgical repair, and used blood flow restriction during the rehab phase\n\nThe patient wanted to get back to training sooner so was open to this technique\nHis recovery was remarkable and it piqued Peter’s curiosity\n\n\nThe term KAATSU is synonymous with blood flow restriction, and it’s Japanese for training with increasing pressure \n\nMore accurately, it’s a brand of apparatus used for this technique\n\n\n\nHow was this hypothesis tested, that blood flow restriction while training will produce improved results?\n\n\n\nShinohara published the first paper in 1998; they had subjects do leg exercises with blood flow restriction on one leg but not the other; greater change was observed in the limb with blood flow restriction\n\n This was 30 years after Sato began experimenting with this stuff in Japan\n\n\nThe idea of blood flow restriction is to reduce blood flow going into the limb but not completely occlude blood flow\nThere is a tremendous amount of variability in how the pressure was applied early on\n\nEarly studies would take a cuff and apply the same pressure to every single person, independent of their blood pressure or limb size or cuff size (these are all important factors)\n\n\nThe current method is to begin by taking the cuff up to the lowest pressure for which there is no blood flow at all; then change the pressure to a percentage of that  \n\nThis ensures some blood flow during exercise\nOne could use ultrasound, use a handheld Doppler Probe that’s essentially detecting the pulse to determine the pressure at which there is no blood flow (arterial occlusion pressure or AOP)\n\nTake for example the ankle; before doing any exercise, the patient simply lies down, the cuff is slowly inflated until blood flow isn’t heard; note the pressure and take a percentage of it\n\nIf the arterial occlusion pressure measured is 100 mmHg, then typically use anywhere between 40-80 mmHg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AOP is the lowest pressure for which there is no blood flow\n\nThe cuff size used for blood flow restriction matters; it will change the pressure\n\nPressure and force are related by the area that the cuff takes up; so the wider the cuff, the lower the pressure needed to reach occlusion\nSome think a wider cuff is better because a lower pressure can be used, but this is not true; it’s all relative\nIf the AOP is 100 mmHg, then 40-80% of this is a wide range\n\nExercising at 40 mmHg versus 80 mmHG may be the difference  between comfort and discomfort\n\n\n\n“40%, that’s the pressure that we use when all we care about is muscle adaptations. In other words, increasing muscle size and strength. Now, you can see the same adaptation at 80% with a little bit less work because you’re going to fail sooner, but the discomfort is going to be much higher.” – Jeremy Loenneke\n\n\n\nJeremy’s preliminary data suggests that some vascular changes may require a pressure higher than 40%; but this is just 1 study; it did observed this effect in both the upper and lower body \n\n\n\n\nUsing a moderate pressure (40%) or a high pressure (80-90%) will give pretty much the same changes in muscle size and strength; the discomfort will be quite different \n\nWhat is the variability between individuals for tolerance of discomfort at a fixed occlusive pressure? \n\n“What would the bell curve look like? How tight would it be for the time at which a person cries uncle?”\n\nBlood Flow Restricted Exercise and Discomfort: A Review (2020)\n\n\nDiscomfort studies applying 40% AOP and having people simply sit show a low variability from person to person; the study stopped at 4 minutes and everyone could do the exercise\n\nSome people are going to experience that as more discomfort than other people\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean the blood flow is reduced by 40% either; that is different\nThe blood flow may differ from person to person depending on how big the muscle is and a variety of other things\nThere are some people who perceive almost everything as extreme discomfort; the discomfort they feel at 40 is not different than it is at 80 because they already rated it so high; there are people on the opposite side who rate the discomfort low too\n\nThat’s a limitation of the discomfort scale\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe details and metrics related to exercise under blood flow restriction [44:45]\nHow much of the arterial flow of blood occurs at 40% AOP? How much venous pooling occurs?\n\nJeremy doesn’t know that off the top of his head; it isn’t 40%; on average it’s a bit lower\n\nIt also depends upon the position and exercise\n\n\nVenous occlusion probably occurs because the thought is, it doesn’t take a lot of pressure to collapse the vein\n\nDuring exercise the blood is pumping back out with the muscle pump\nAt rest there is usually venous pooling\n\n\nPeter did a workout with a set of leg presses\n\n30 reps, rest 30 seconds, then 15 reps, rest 30 seconds, 15, rest 30 seconds, 15\nHe’s not sure what hurt worse, the 30 seconds in between or the last 2 sets\n\n\n\n“The whole thing was just so wildly uncomfortable” – Peter Attia\n\nBut he’s flying by the seat of his pants because this is not based on occlusive pressure (AOP); so he doesn’t know how far off he is\nJeremy has already convinced him that he should be more scientific in my approach\n\n\n\n\nJeremy agrees that Peter’s workout is tough; even stronger subjects are going to be at failure with this number of reps (30, 15, 15, 15 reps)\n\nIn his experiments, he has people exercise 4 sets at as many repetitions as they can; this controls for effort\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of repetitions can be used as a weak surrogate of blood flow restriction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 20-30% one should get close to 30 repetitions on the first set then maybe 12-15 reps on the second set\n\nIf one cannot achieve 30 reps on the first set, then the load is probably too high or the wraps are too tight\n\n\n\n\nIf there is pain before exercising, then it’s too tight\nIn practical use of restriction, he uses a knee wrap; he doesn’t know how much pressure is being applied\nIn a clinical setting or for rehabilitation, it’s important to know what pressure is being applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a healthy person going to the gym, knowing the pressure is not that important\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this discussion, if the load is low and one is in pain after applying the wraps, then the wraps are too tight\n\nLoosen the wraps and one should get close to 30 reps on the first set, then close to 15 reps on the last 3 sets\nThis will depend on strength; one might fail pretty quick in the 4th set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of repetitions can provide some idea of the level of blood flow restriction being applied\n\nWhat would be the maximum amount of time a subject should work under pressure, at 40% occlusive pressure (considering the combined lift and recovery period)\n\nThis depends if they are resistance training or are they doing low-intensity aerobic exercise\n\nFor low-intensity aerobic exercise, one can probably keep it on for 30 or 40 minutes; there shouldn’t be much discomfort at low intensity\n\nThe cuffs are not all that tight \nOne is not building up a tremendous amount of metabolites\nThis is probably not providing a tremendous amount adaptation either\n\n\nFor resistance exercise, just starting out, 7-10 minutes is a good place to start\n\nDon’t leave the cuffs on for more than a few exercises\nWhen one is just starting out, don’t go beyond 1 exercise\n\n\n\n\nIn his studies with people who are untrained, performing multiple exercises is pretty tough\nHe suggests beginning with 4 sets of an exercise, then take the cuffs or wrap off\n\nWhat other metrics could people use if they don’t have access to a Doppler to determine the pressure?\n\nSystolic blood pressure is not always the same as occlusive pressure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the size of the cuffs are similar (for both applying pressure and measuring systolic blood pressure) then systolic blood pressure could be used as a basis for determining % pressure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the average gym-goer, it’s simpler to apply the wrap as a percentage of resting limb size\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is some data on this working with people who come into the clinic to learn exercises to do at home; in the clinic a device is used to set the occlusive pressure to 40%; they are told to mimic this pressure at home\n\nSome are successful but this can vary between 20-50% AOP; not terrible but also not great\n\n\nThis idea was based on a paper a long time ago that said the pressure should rate a 7 out of 10 to be sure it is subocclusive\n\nThe range for this is huge; one day a person may be at 90% AOP and the next day the same feeling might be 10% AOP\nThis scale isn’t recommended anymore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen conditioning is the goal, use a percentage of resting circumference and then use repetitions as a guide\n\n\nPeter doesn’t have nice cuffs, but the thing he likes is they have numbers on them; this gives him a sense of how tight to wrap them\n\n \nConsiderations when training with blood flow restriction: loading, pace, rest, and risks [53:00]\nWeight\n\nChoose a weight that is 20-30% of a 1-rep maximum weight \nThe utility is the ability to use blood flow restriction (BFR) with very low loads\nHe’s tried combining  BFR with high loads but the benefits are not additive; BFR doesn’t add anything to use a high load over a low load\n\nHigh load exercise is a maximum stimulus; it’s hard to maximize something that’s already pretty much maximal in a given training session\nIf one wants to lift with heavy weights, then just do that; but the utility of BFR is that lower loads can be used to achieve results\n\n\n\nPacing\n\n\n\nThe slower the pace of exercise, the less repetition one is going to be able to do; this probably doesn’t matter too much overall for growth\n\n\n\n\nHe typically uses a 1 second up 1 second down pace\n\n\n\n\nThis is a nice, controlled movement\n\n\nSome people use 1.5 seconds\nPeter asks if what matters most is time under tension; so slower pace and fewer reps are still okay\n\nYes; when Jeremy thinks about a muscle growing it needs to be activated for a sufficient length of time to get all of those signaling pathways turned on; there’s many ways for this to occur\n\nOne can use really, really heavy weights repeatedly\nOne can use low loads or a very slow pace\nBoth of these are recruiting more and more fibers, activating them, and signaling them to grow; both approaches should accomplish the same thing\n\n\n\n\n\nRest\n\nJeremy generally uses 30 second rest intervals\n\n\nThis works well especially if one is targeting a muscle that’s necessarily directly under blood flow restriction\n\nFor example the chest\nSome data support doing a standard bench press exercise with blood flow restriction around the arms to augment the size of the chest \n\nMuscles distal to the cuff (the triceps) are fatiguing and the chest is picking up the load\nIn the gym, he likes to experiment with that; so do some chest and then superset with some tricep extensions or something like that; but this hasn’t been studied in the lab\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about doing complex, multi-joint movements under restriction?\n\nData looking at bench press, squat, and they have seen some benefits assuming use of light weights\nHe prefers isolation movements, especially if the goal is growth\nHe thinks the success would vary depending on the movement \nOne can do compounds, there is evidence that suggests it can help with the squat, help with the barbell bench press\nHe tenda to use isolation movements and for research purposes \nHe feels better, safer doing isolation types of exercises\n\nRisks\n\n\n\nPeter asks if he is worried about rhabdo, or nerve damage\nFirst, it helps to understand that this is a very acute response\n\nBlood flow is restricted for minutes not hours\n\n\nThe safety profile overall is comparable to that of high load exercise or traditional exercise\nTwo common concerns are blood clotting and muscle damage\n\nEverything carries with it a risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood flow restriction does not appear to increase the risk of blood clots or muscle damage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne will be sore after performing exercise under blood flow restriction, but when one looks at the muscle fiber it appears to be intact; there does not appear to be structural damage\n\n\nHave CK levels been measured to compare muscle damage with and without restriction?\n\n\n\n\nThere is not a whole lot of difference in CK levels between the same exercise without blood flow restriction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is certainly soreness but not structural damage\n\n\nWhat is the blood pressure response proximal to the cuff when exercising?  Is blood pressure going up centrally in the heart, the aorta, the brain?\n\nCompared to the same exercise without blood flow restriction, blood pressure is usually higher but comparable to (or even a little lower) than high load exercise\nHow high does blood pressure get and how quickly does it return back to baseline\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to high load exercise, blood pressure is similar and usually comes back down to baseline within five minutes in healthy individuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain populations may hyper-respond, so that is something to consider\n\n\nPeter notes in his experience, when he does unrestricted heavy movements (so five to eight reps of deadlifts or something where he’s really going for it) it feels like he has a much higher blood pressure than the blood pressure he feels when exercising under BFR\n\nWith BFR exercise he’s never got the feeling like his head’s going to pop off his shoulders, which he commonly feels when doing a heavy deadlift\n\n\n\n\n\n“But I would say that overall, it does appear to be very safe” – Jeremy Loenneke\n\nIn the studies that have been done, it appears to be relatively safe\n\nAs with anything, for example, when giving a drug in a large clinical trial, one will start to see some side effects that were never seen before\nHe expects that when it becomes more and more popular, there will be certain rare events that have never seen before\n\n\n\n \nBlood flow restriction studies and the relationship between muscle size and muscle strength [1:04:15]\nComparing exercise of one arm under blood flow restriction to the other arm without restriction \n\n\n\nComparing exercise using the same exercise, same weights, same number of reps, same rest, in the same individual where one arm is subject to blood flow restriction and the other arm is not restricted\n\nShinohara did some of these experiments \nThe criticism on within subject studies is with respect to strength, not necessarily muscle growth because it has been observed that when training one side but not the other, the other arm often increases in strength; Jeremy is not sure this happens when both limbs are trained\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy thinks the limbs respond to the local training\n\n\n\n\nDoes the limb under blood flow restriction show gains in strength and/or size as compared to the other, unrestricted limb performing the same exercise\n\n\n\n\nYes, limbs trained under BFR show gains in strength and size\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy notes that the response in the blood flow restriction subject will be better than a work-matched control, even if it’s the same person\n\nWith the caveat that exercise is not done to failure; this is difficult because even at 30% AOP (arterial occlusion pressure) some people will be reaching failure during 4 sets in the non-occluded arm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen training one limb to failure and the other limb with BFR to failure, the adaptation observed is pretty similar; but the exercise volume needed is much lower with the blood flow restricted limb\n\n“blood flow restriction by itself, so just the application of restriction and deflation, in some ACL reconstruction post-surgery environment has shown to have some sort of benefit” – Jeremy Loenneke\n\nEven if people walk very slowly under blood flow restriction (not even close to failure) there appears to be some adaptation, though not as much as seen with resistance exercise\n\n\nWith resistance exercise, it might be fair to say that blood flow occlusion is causing more of the muscle to activate sooner (and then fatigue sooner) than under a non-occluded condition\n\n\n\n\nBlood flow restriction is just a tool to increase the time to failure and therefore act as a more efficient means to fatigue the various fibers\nAll of the benefits of blood flow restriction are not known\n\n\n\nThe relationship between strength and hypertrophy\n\nConventional wisdom is that once muscle growth is there, it is probably contributing to changes in strength\n\nNeural changes occur first followed by large contributions from muscle hypertrophy\n\n\n\n“I started to really see that maybe that’s actually not the case because we almost always see muscle growth which is similar to or equivalent to that of highload exercise, but the strength (assuming that we’re not practicing the test repeatedly) is almost always less.” – Jeremy Loenneke\n\n\n\nJeremy has done research in the low load realm and has begun to see that perhaps muscle hypertrophy does not increase strength\n\n\n\n\nHe almost always see muscle growth which is similar to or equivalent to that of high load exercise, but the strength (assuming that we’re not practicing the test repeatedly) is almost always less\n\n\n\n\nHe began to question “where did this story come from about muscle growth playing a role [in strength], and why do we even think it in the first place”\n\nThis is where it really becomes difficult for people to have this conversation because everybody has learned this paradigm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe thinks if one compared a bunch of people and measured muscle size and strength, on average it would be true that people who are bigger would be stronger, people who are smaller would be weaker\n\n\n\n\nBut that’s not an effect of exercise because the same relationship is seen in people who have never exercised in their life\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation or association between strength and size is equally strong in the untrained as it is in the trained\n\n\n\nThe question here is, when a person begins to exercise and then they get stronger, is that due to changes in muscle size?\n “Okay. But were those studies ever able to actually make that claim?” – Jeremy Loenneke\n\n\n\nHe doesn’t question if they are related\n\n\n\n\nDoes a change in one result in a change in the other?\n\n\n\n\nIt makes sense that it would, actin (protein) is increasing so why would this not produce increased strength\nHowever, there are numerous times in the literature where greater changes in muscle size occur but strength doesn’t change\n\n\n\n“So that leads me to believe that there could be quite a bit of disconnect with respect to muscle growth and the change in strength.” – Jeremy Loenneke\nPublications establishing the current paradigm linking increased muscle hypertrophy to increased strength\n\n\n\nJeremy wrote a review trying to go back to the root of this dogma\n\nHe found there were 3 papers (mentioned below) that formulated this viewpoint that neural changes occur first, followed by hypertrophy\n\n\nOne paper commonly cited studied 5 individuals where one arm lifted weights and the other arm did no work\n\nThey inferred muscle growth off changes in the slope of integrated EMG \n\nIf they saw a change in slope, they inferred it to mean muscle growth\nIn Jeremy’s opinion: one cannot infer growth off a change in EMG\nThe EMG amplitude is essentially an estimate of muscle action potential\nTo explain what they were doing, pick a variety of weights (10 lbs, 20 lbs, 30 lbs, etc) and measure the EMG amplitude when a subject lifts each weight, and they would repeat this measurement every couple weeks\n\nSo if the subject lifted 10 lbs and the amplitude was a little less, they would infer muscle growth\nThey are using the amplitude to assess the neurologic signal and over time if the neurologic signal goes down while the effort remains the same, they assume hypertrophy (muscle growth) makes up the difference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne point Jeremy likes to make is: this guarantees that at some point, hypertrophy is going to be a mechanism; they’re not actually testing a mechanism; they’re just assuming that at some point it will be a mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey did measure arm circumference, but that was not the variable used to quantify growth\n\n\nThe other commonly cited study is by Ikai and Fukunaga; they actually measure muscle size\n\n\n\n\nTo his knowledge, this is the first study to document changes in muscle size in response to resistance exercise – a landmark paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey infer that if muscle growth changes, then it must be playing a role; and if muscle growth doesn’t change when subjects got stronger, then it must be neutral – this has been the paradigm ever since\n\nFor example, if he runs a training study and the subjects get stronger but no change in muscle size is observed, they would conclude neural changes are at work\nSimilarly, in this study, if the subjects got stronger and changes in muscle size were measured then they would conclude that both neural changes and hypertrophy are responsible for increasing strength\nJeremy thinks there is a fallacy in making this claim:  this logic assumes that the ability to document something (hypertrophy) thereby attributes it as a reason for increasing strength\n\nThis logic makes intuitive sense but he would like to see it more rigorously tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically the link between muscle hypertrophy and strength comes from these 2 studies and reviews by Digby Sale \n\nIkai and Fukunaga’s 1970 publication, A study on training effect on strength per unit cross-sectional area of muscle by means of ultrasonic measurement \nMortani and deVries 1979 publication,  Neural factors versus hypertrophy in the time course of muscle strength gain \nSale’s review in 1982, Physiology of weight-lifting exercise  \nSale’s review in 1988, Neural adaptation to resistance training  \n\nSale suggests that most training studies are only documenting a certain aspect of the actual person’s training age; they’re never going to be able to actually answer this question because the studies are too short\nJeremy questions this because the study by Moritani and deVries used 8 weeks, and this is the same duration as a lot of other studies that have contradicted this paradigm of hypertrophy resulting in increasing strength\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheses studies are the basis for the idea that strength comes from neural changes followed by hypertrophy\n\n \nEvidence that increasing muscular strength is not dependent on increasing the size of the muscle [1:16:30]\n\n\n\nPeter notes that blood flow restriction seems to provide an elegant tool to test this hypothesis, but what other experiments could test this without blood flow restriction?\n\nCould someone do workouts where they only do 1-5 reps of an exercise; they’re basically always working to failure, whether it’s 1 rep max or 2 reps or 3 reps\nFor example, he knows athletes who try to maximize strength and minimize hypertrophy\n\nRunners, for example, want to maximize the strength to weight ratio; they want to add strength without adding size\nThey train with a trap bar, they do not do the eccentric motion; they lift the weight up and drop it, lift the weight up and drop it; and they’re never going above five reps\n\n\nThe opposite workout would be more of a bodybuilding workout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks if these 2 workouts could uncouple the metrics of strength and hypertrophy\n\n\n\n\nJeremy agrees and has tried to address this question several times via study design\n\nOne group trains doing a 1RM test (repetition maximum); they come in and work up to about 5 reps in total then go home\n\nIn this group they are trying to maximize the strength signal but not get growth\nThis group should show what strength looks like if muscle growth does not occur\n\n\nCompare this to the traditional training group; they would do about 8-12 reps of a very simple movement, the bicep curl\n\nIn this group both muscle growth and increased strength is observed\n\n\nMost articles would conclude that since muscle growth is observed, that muscle growth must be contributing to strength\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy asks: what would strength look like if growth did not occur \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study described above, he found that first group got stronger without increasing muscle size while the second group experiences both increased strength and increased muscle size; but the strength increase was the same in both groups\nHe expects to see a greater separation when assessing more complex movements\nIf doing a barbell bench press (a very, very simple movement) he would expect the group doing 1RM to be far better than the group doing 8-12 reps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis results suggest that change in muscle size is not necessary for a change in strength nor does it appear to be contributing given that the strength is the same in these 2 groups\n\n\n\n\nLimitations – in order to get that differential in growth, they had to apply slightly different exercise patterns\n\nOne group was doing 8 to 12 reps, it’s still a high load but not 100%; where as the other group was training at 100%\n\nSome suggest this is not a fair comparison\n\n\nThere are more differences than simply muscle growth in these 2 groups; others have suggests they follow-up on these with mediation analysis to look at how much of this change relative to a control is driven by muscle size within each group individually\n\nWhen they did this, they did not see any mediation, meaning that none of the change in strength could be explained by that change in muscle size in either one of the groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediation analysis – \n\n\n\nThere are some statistical approaches where one can look at the relationship between 2 exercise groups; instead of looking at them head to head, compare them individually to a group that is not exercising at all\n\nThis can control for many factors: random error across time, measurement noise, random biological variation, etc.\nJeremy explains mediation analysis as “saying “Okay, we have this group here. How much strength did they gain?” So they got stronger. That’s a direct relationship. So when this group exercised, they got stronger. Now, mediation says, “Okay, let’s add in a variable here to see if we can remove this relationship [between exercise and increased strength] either partially or completely.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen muscle growth is added to this model it no longer correlates with strength; this indicates the relationship is driven by another variable, not muscle growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe didn’t expect a complete correlation between muscle growth and strength, but he did expect a  partial correlation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo correlation between strength and muscle growth was seen in either group\n\n\nPeter asks “Is the contrapositive then that it’s not at all coupled?” \nHis intuition would be that there is an association, not 100% causal; the R2 value might be 0.5 not 0.99\nHe would not guess no association or a negative association or one-to-one causal association\nMediation analysis could show if there were partial mediation; but none was observed\n\nThey didn’t see any effect at all\nThere are other potential reasons, random error with measurements cannot be ruled out\nJeremy does see an accumulation of evidence suggesting that if muscle growth does play a role in strength, it is so small that they are not able to detect it\n\n\n\n“I am not sure that muscle growth in response to exercise is a mechanism [for increasing strength]. I’ve seen no experimental evidence that suggests that that’s the case.” – Jeremy Loenneke\n\nIn practical terms, when someone is interested in getting as strong as possible, they don’t care whether muscle growth is a mechanism driving strength or not; they just want to get strong\n\nWhat was learned from these experiments in terms of increasing one’s strength?\n\nThere is a huge specificity component; train a good portion of time at or close to 1RM \n\n\n\n\nIf strength is desired for squatting or deadlift; then spend time training at 1RM with these exercises\n\n\nTraining to increase muscle growth typically requires a lot of recovery because a large volume of exercise is required to make a muscle grow\nIf strength is the goal, then perhaps less time can be devoted to high repetition exercise\n\n\nJeremy is performing more experiments to address the role of (or lack thereof) muscle growth in increasing muscle strength\n\nWhat are other explanations to explain how strength increases? \n\n\n\nNo one disputes the neurologic component; is there another mechanism?\nSome have the opinion that the exercise-induced changes are probably predominantly neural; Jeremy’s not there yet\nHe thinks there could be some local changes at the muscle, and that might be able to explain why some groups get stronger; that it’s not just neural\n\nPerhaps the muscle at the local level gets better at responding to forceful contractions\nMaybe there are qualitative alterations in the local muscle that are not due to muscle size such as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the muscle deals with calcium\n\n\nHow the myosin head binds\n\n\nJeremy thinks the usual argument isn’t fair – “Well, if muscle growth is not a mechanism, then what exactly is it?”\n\nOne doesn’t explain something by stating “We don’t have a lot of evidence for this, and there’s a lot of evidence against this” \n\n\nHe does think there is a neural component to developing strength, he also thinks there may be molecular changes in the muscle other than growth but he hasn’t identified this yet\n\n \nPractical applications of blood flow restriction training for athletes and average people [1:27:30]\nHow common is BFR (blood flow restriction) with athletes today?\n\n\n\nIt’s becoming more common; at Ole Miss and many Division 1 schools, a large portion of the athletic departments have blood flow restriction devices\n\nThey are using them for rehab\n\n\nHe’s seen players in the NBA and the NFL using BFR \n\nFor both rehab and everyday training\nPerhaps they recover a little quicker using BFR\nThey perceive it as a way to get a workout in without having to spend so much time recovering\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the speed of recovery a function of less trauma to the muscle during a BFR workout?\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t known\nBut it appears that when athletes are injured and working out with BFR, they get more out of it and have less pain during movement\n\n\nHow would a bodybuilder use BFR?\n\nThe goal of a bodybuilder, not being judged on strength, is to build volume; Peter discussed this with Layne on the podcast and he explained “Look, at the end of the day, the volume is what’s going to matter” \n\nThis can be accomplished with isolated movements\nUsing compound movements requires lots and lots of volume across these kinds of ranges\n\n\nJeremy thinks BFR could be a valuable tool for bodybuilders depending on how they feel any given day\n\nIf one is not feeling good and has a heavy day at the gym, they could use BFR to achieve similar training with lighter weights\nOn days one isn’t feeling focused lifting heaving weights can be dangerous; using BFR is an option to improve safety because lighter weights are used and it doesn’t require as much focus\nHe thinks BFR can be used to promote muscle growth\nBFR can help with exercise variety\nIf one is hurt, evidence is accumulating that it is helpful in rehabilitation\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s important to note that if a person’s not comfortable with it, they don’t have to do blood flow restriction in order to optimize how much muscle that they can grow. But it is a tool that could be potentially quite effective for them.” – Jeremy Loenneke\nWhen to use BFR and common concerns\n\nPeter relates what happened in his workout today\n\nHe had a heavish day scheduled; the main set was a 5 by 5 deadlift\nHe had 5 sets to warm up and get to the starting weight\nHe was struggling with the first set of 5 and other sets\nHe thought on the 5th set in that he might hurt himself by breaking his form; this is when he stopped and switched to the leg press with BFR\n\nIt was a very light weight, that without BFR he could have done hundreds of reps with\n\n\n\n\nPeter thinks BFR is a great way to mix up training\n\nIt’s a tool for people who don’t have the technique to do heavier lifts\nIt’s an alternative to painful, Super Slow training\n\n\nJeremy was never really interested in Super Slow training\n\nHe never felt like he was going to get very strong with that method\nThe movement is slow and the weight is usually light so he questions how transferable this exercise is\nHe agrees this type of training is hard; he didn’t enjoy it\n\n\nPeter clarifies “the one place where it’s unambiguous that you need to be doing a traditional lift without restriction is if you’re training for maximum strength of that lift” \n\nHe doesn’t think most people are doing maximum strength bicep curls\nBut for a bench press, squat, deadlift, or leg press, there’s probably no substitute for for a 80% to 100% 1RM\nJeremy agrees\n\n\n\n \nSituations in which blood flow restriction training is most advantageous [1:35:30]\n\nExercising with low load under BFR will allow someone to build strength but to a much smaller degree than they would under traditional exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe load cannot be too low, 20-30% is too low\n\n\nJeremy uses the bicep curl as a research model to answer particular questions; these studies aren’t designed for personal training\nOne must keep in sight the reason why certain things are done\n\nSome will look at the BFR literature and see a study that found similar changes in high load exercise; but the majority of studies do not find this effect\n\nIn the methods, the low load BFR group does 1RM every 2 or 3 weeks in an attempt to reset the load so they can assume they’re progressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what they end of up doing is practicing lifting a heavy weight, so this is not studying low loads of BFR; it’s low loads of BFR plus 1RM training\n\n\n\n\nJeremy published a review of studies done with only low loads of BFR (without the 1RM test); their results are less than those produced by high load exercise\n\nReview from 2020, Strength testing or strength training: considerations for future research\nThis illustrates the point that the best way to improve heavy lifting is to practice lifting heavy weights\nOne will still get stronger lifting a lighter weight, but not as strong as lifting heavy weights\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the big picture, there are 2 areas where BFR shines\n\nFor a person who can’t lift heavy weight but still needs to get stronger and potentially bigger\n\n\nSomeone who is recovering from injury\nSomeone with concerns about lifting heavy weights due to technique or simply seeking to avoid injury\n\n\nFor a person seeking to increase muscle hypertrophy\n\n\n\n\nMost studies demonstrate slightly superior hypertrophy resulting from exercise under BFR despite less total volume of exercise and lower load\n\n\n\n\nJeremy agrees, low load exercise with BFR produces more hypertrophy than exercise with a matched load\n\n\n\n\nPeter clarifies, to make them equal, one has to do more reps (repeat until failure) on the unrestricted side; and this takes more time\n\n\n\nJeremy clarifies a point about vascular adaptations\n\nHe expected vascular adaptations to be the same across the board (with or without BFR) as long as one is doing lots of reps\n\nThis is not what they found; vascular adaptations were not the same with BFR\n\nHe wants to repeat these experiments\n\n\nHe thought just the workload would be less for BFR; this is true for muscle but he doesn’t know if it’s true for all variables\n\n\n\n \nThe mechanisms by which blood flow restriction training can produce so much hypertrophy at such low loads [1:39:45]\nThe role of lactate levels\n\n\n\nPeter assumes that one reason why BFR can produce so much hypertrophy using a low load is the response to metabolic challenge\n\nHe tested lactate levels with and without BFR using blood from a pin-prick of his finger \nWhen he occludes the arm and exercises, the lactate levels go through the roof at locations well distal to the occlusion\n\nHe’s pin-pricking his finger and getting very, very high levels of lactate\n Is this because the lactate is not allowed to clear out of circulation?\n\n\nLactate is a metabolic by-product of exercise, especially this type of exercise\nHe had a higher level of lactate exercising under BFR than when unoccluded and lifting slightly more weight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks if lactate levels matter\n\n\nJeremy explains as lactate pools, it may turn on some anabolic signaling pathways to activate growth\n\nSo exercising under BFR is thought to trap lactate in the muscle where it may augment muscle activation\n\nTrapped metabolites (such as lactate) may cause the muscle to work harder than it normally would\nLactate may fatigue some of the cross-bridges formed during muscle contraction\n\nInteraction between the actin and myosin microfilaments occur as myosin heads form cross-bridges with actin \n\nThe figure below shows actin filaments in green and myosin filaments in purple\nNotice the purple balls on the myosin filament interact with the actin filament\nThis is the sliding filament model of muscle contraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16195\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/f4-jeremyL-1024x937.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"937\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/f4-jeremyL-1024x937.jpeg 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/f4-jeremyL-300x275.jpeg 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/f4-jeremyL-768x703.jpeg 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/f4-jeremyL-1536x1406.jpeg 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/f4-jeremyL.jpeg 1650w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 4.

Figure credit: OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology Figure 10.10\n\n\n\n When cross-bridges fatigue, more and more fibers may need to be recruited to complete the work\n\n\n\n\nIn this model metabolites induce fatigue, this leads to further muscle activation; and muscle activation for a sufficient amount of time is what makes the muscle grow\n\nAre the mechanisms in play with BFR different from that of traditional exercise\n\n\n\nDoes high load exercise employ a different mechanism than low load exercise with BFR?\n\n\n\n\nJeremy thinks no\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mechanism involved in activation is different, but once the muscle fiber is activated, the signaling pathway is going to be similar\nFor example, a 1RM bicep curl trying to lift 70 lbs (an enormous weight) activates a large portion of the musculature\nCompare this to low loads, fewer muscle fibers are activated initially because the weight is low\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise with low loads under BFR initially activates fewer muscle fibers, but as metabolites are trapped, more and more fibers are activated so ultimately a similar amount of fibers are activated compared to exercise with high load\n\n\nPeter asks what happens to fiber fatigue under 2 scenarios without BFR: 8-10 reps with 80 lbs versus 40 reps with 40 lbs.\n\nJeremy explains Henneman’s size principle\n\nThis relates the input and output of motor neuron and their muscle fibers to size and size-ordered activation during movement\nA motor unit is a motor neuron + muscle fibers\nWith any exercise 1 motor unit is recruited first\nAs required a 2nd motor unit is recruited and so on, in a sequential fashion as needed\nLifting a heavy weight recruits 2 motor units quickly\nLifting a lower weight takes longer to recruit 2 motor units\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscle fiber types used in exercise\n\n\n\nFor example, if a person fails at 8 reps with 80 lbs and 40 reps with 40 lbs; it simply means the 40 reps took longer to burn through the type I fibers and the type IIA’s and IIAB’s, and then at the end of the exercise the type IIX’s failed  \nIf this person repeated the exercise 20 minutes later at 80 lbs and failed at 8 reps this means he got to the IIX sooner\n\nType IIX muscle fiber are fast twitch, produce the largest force, and are easily fatigued\n\nThey rely on anaerobic respiration which produces lactate\n\n\n\n\nType I and II fibers both grow in response to exercise: high load, low load, with or without BFR\n\n\n\n\nAt the extreme level, a body builder’s hypertrophy is explained by growth in both types of fibers\n\n \nApplications of “passive” blood flow restriction training [1:47:15]\n\nFor someone with serious injury\nFor example, someone who had ACL surgery\n\nApply BFR to their limb, inflate and deflate for a period of time, a couple times a day to slow muscle loss\nOnly a few studies on this\nMuscle growth does not occur, rather loss of muscle is slowed\n\n\n\nProgression of BFR in someone who cannot do anything, even walk\n\nApply restriction to slow muscle loss\nWalk slowly when able\nTransition to resistance exercise; this is where they will see the most improvement\nGo on to high load exercise if they choose\n\n\n\n\nMuscle loss occurs in sedentary individuals following surgery or injury\nMuscle loss in the elderly is huge and has devastating effects\n\nFor someone in their 70’s if they train hard for 1 year and put on pounds of muscle but then lay in a hospital bed for 10 days, they will lose all of this muscle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBFR could be a tool to slow this muscle loss; this needs to be studied\n\n\nPeter remarks this is one thing he discusses with his patients, after age 70 they are 1 fall away from the end of life\n\nEven if they don’t die right away\nMany elderly never get back on their feet after an injury\nPassive, low-end aerobic, low load resistance exercise could help them regain strength and stamina \n\nUltimately getting back to high load exercise would be great\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat experiments would Jeremy do if he had unlimited resources? [1:51:45]\n\nHe wants to figure out why people get stronger\nThis can tie into BFR\nWhat does a change in strength from resistance training mean for the overall function of a person\n\nDoes getting stronger carry over to improvements in walking ability, etc.\n\n\nHe would like to study more applications of BFR in people in a hospital setting, on a large scale\n\nCurrent studies have an extremely small sample size\n\n\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialReview of muscle anatomy: Skeletal Muscle Structure | GreatPacificMedia (October 4, 2009) (youtube.com) | [8:00]\nReview by Andy Galpin on fast and slow twitch muscle fibers: Moving human muscle physiology research forward: an evaluation of fiber type-specific protein research methodologies | American Journal of Physiology.
