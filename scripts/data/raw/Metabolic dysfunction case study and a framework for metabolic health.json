Patient C – Lipid panel.\nAt first glance—\n\nThis patient does NOT meet the criteria to be considered having metabolic syndrome\nHis lipid panel also shows a good outlook\nIn fact, if he goes to the doctor, he will most likely be told he has a complete bill of health\n\nDigging a little deeper—Looking at liver function test (LFT) — These are enzymes that are produced by the liver under the stress of the liver. So as the liver is experiencing any inflammation or scarring, these numbers will get higher and higher and higher.\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13585\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-LFT-1024x407.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"407\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-LFT-1024x407.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-LFT-300x119.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-LFT-768x305.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-LFT.png 1112w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 8. Patient C – LFTs.\nNote: Peter thinks of normal ALT and AST as being below 20 whereas the labs will say that below 40 is normal (see Rob Lustig episode of The Drive)\nInflammation markers—\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13584\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-Inflammation-markers-1024x242.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"242\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-Inflammation-markers-1024x242.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-Inflammation-markers-300x71.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-Inflammation-markers-768x182.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-Inflammation-markers.png 1268w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 9. Patient C – Inflammation markers.\nOther important metrics—\n\nHomocysteine = 12 (lab will say this is pretty normal, but Peter thinks it’s too high)\nUric acid = 7.8\n\nEven the lab says that this number is too high — but the lab is thinking about this through the lens of gout\nPeter on the other hand sees this as very concerning through the lens of blood pressure and insulin resistance (see Rick Johnson’s episode of The Drive)\nPeter wants his patients below 5 on the uric acid scale, “non-negotiable”\nIdeally, uric acid is in the 2-3 range\nPeter has seen incredible benefits on blood pressure and insulin simply by reducing the uric acid\n\n\n\n*Summary of observations about Patient C so far: \n\nThis guy is 0 for 5 on metabolic syndrome\nHe looks to be as insulin sensitive as they come\nYet his uric acid is 7.8 and his homocysteine is 12 — both signs of inflammation\n\nLooking at his insulin and OGTT results—\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13587\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-OGTT-1024x281.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-OGTT-1024x281.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-OGTT-300x82.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-OGTT-768x211.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-C-OGTT.png 1106w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 10. Patient C – OGTT results.\nNotable observations:\n\nFasting insulin at baseline is quite high\nAt 90 minutes, insulin is still dramatically elevated\n\nThoughts and lessons:\n\nThis is a guy who metabolically slips through the cracks in most cases\nYou can’t just look at the traditional markers of metabolic syndrome — you’ve got to dig a little bit deeper\n\nHow the treatment has gone with Patient C:\n\nGoal was to reduce inflammation by correcting homocysteine and insulin levels\n\nIt has been stubbornly difficult to correct his homocysteine—He’s got an MTHFR mutation that has made it complicated\nIt took a year to get this patient’s fasting insulin to a normal range\n\n\nCGM became a very helpful tool for him as well on the behavioral front, because he was struggling with some of the things he was eating\nHe struggled with some bad eating habits — He runs marathons was mainlining energy goos and such and it took him a while to understand how damaging those foods can be\n\n \n§"
