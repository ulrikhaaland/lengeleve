He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations? [35:00]; What makes the human brain different than all other species? [44:15]; Imprinting stress to your kids epigenetically [48:00]; The role of stress on memory and the consequences of hypercortisolemia [53:00]; The impact of subjective socioeconomic status and social media on stress levels and health [57:45]; Tips for managing stress in the modern world [1:13:15]; What Robert learned about himself studying the social behavior of baboons [1:25:30]; The multilayered factors behind every human behavior, the context of “good and bad”, and exploring the human capacity of the wild extremes of violence and altruism from moment to moment [1:30:15]; PMS: How two women with identical hormone levels can have completely different emotional experiences [1:34:45]; How much of a role do genes play in depression and other emotional states? [1:38:00]; Why is cortisol elevated under sleep deprivation?

⇒ They’ve either lost their job, may lose their job, or just in general they have a great deal of anxiety because of COVID. \n\n\n\n\n\n2—Timing of sleep:\n\nThis study showed people were going to bed about 30 minutes later and waking up about 50 minutes later the next morning\nMatt says “night owls are being allowed to be much more owl-like and sleeping in harmony with their chronotype.”\n\n3—Dreaming: People have been reporting having more dreams since the pandemic began \n(more on this in the following section)\n \nThe importance of dreaming for emotional health, and how the coronavirus pandemic has increased dreaming [11:45]\nHow has dreaming been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic? \n\nDreaming has increased\nTwo different reasons—\n\n1) Timing of sleep, and maybe we can, at some point, go over the standard sleep schedule.\n2) Dreaming allows for the purging negative emotion or stress\n\n\n\nTwo principle types of sleep—\n  1 | Non rapid eye movement sleep (non-REM sleep)\n\nNon-REM is then further subdivided into four separate stages\nStage 1 and 2 are typically classified as “light” non-REM sleep\nStage 3 and 4 are the “deep sleep” stage of non-REM sleep\n\n  2 | Rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep)\n\nREM sleep is typically associated with dreaming\nThese are the dreams we think of as narrative-based, emotionally-filled, bizarre, hallucinogenic, dreams\n\nThe 90 min cycle\n\nnon-REM and REM play out in this “beautiful battle for brain domination” throughout the night\nEvery 90 minutes the battle is repeated to create the standard cycling 90-minute architecture\nThe ratio of non-REM to REM within each 90-minute cycle changes as we move across the night\nIn the first half of the night, the majority of those 90-minute cycles are going to be comprised of a lot of deep non-REM sleep (stages 3 and 4) and very little REM sleep\nIn the second half of the night, the majority of those 90-minute cycles are comprised REM sleep\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7077\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/architecture-of-sleep-1024x423.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"423\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/architecture-of-sleep-1024x423.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/architecture-of-sleep-300x124.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/architecture-of-sleep-768x318.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 1. The architecture of sleep. Image credit: Episode #47 – Matthew Walker on sleep – Part I\nSo how has the coronavirus pandemic increased dreaming?\nReason #1: People are sleeping in a little bit later into the morning\n\nIf people are now, on average, going to bed a little bit later, and sleeping in significantly later in the morning…\nIt means that they’re now sleeping further into that REM sleep rich window of the night\n\nReason #2: Dreaming is a way that we purge negative emotion or stress in some way\n\nOne of the principle functions of rapid eye movement sleep that we now have understood is that it seems to provide a form of overnight therapy\nREM sleep tries to take the sharp edges off difficult experiences so that when you come back the next day without feeling as emotional as you did about those events the day before\n\n“REM sleep is emotional first aid. . .In other words, it’s not time that heals all wounds. It’s actually time during REM sleep and dreaming that provides this emotional convalescence.”\n*Interesting factoid about sleep:\n\nSleep is responsive—it’s what we call homeostatically regulated, but also homeostatically reflexive \nSo if something happens during the day that requires more of a specific stage of sleep, then sleep will respond by giving the brain a little bit more of that sleep to deal with it\n\n⇒ Example—Learning and memory\n\nMatt has some unpublished data showing that after 3-4 hours of really intensive textbook learning you see an increase amount of the specific type of sleep that’s needed for the fixation of those memories\nAnd if one does a skill-learning task, like a specific sport, you will see a homeostatic response from sleep the following night to try and lock in those new skill memories\n\nSame goes for emotional experiences—If you’ve upped your quotient of emotionally difficult experiences, sleep can respond with greater amounts of REM sleep (dream sleep) to try to help solve those emotional challenges\n \nThe impact of alcohol consumption on sleep quality and stress levels [20:00]\nPeter has found himself consuming more alcohol during the pandemic – he thinks it’s probably stress related \n\nUsing his Oura ring, Peter can clearly see that he sleep quality suffers if he has more than one drink too close to bedtime\n\nHeart rate variability gets crushed\nResting heart rate goes up by 10-25%\nRespiratory rate is up two breaths per minute, and \nCore body temperature is up half a degree\n\n\nFor peter, this is concerning enough on it’s own \nHowever, you now couple that with the fact that how alcohol disproportionately negatively impacts REM sleep (see previous episode of The Drive—Matt Walker, Part 3)\nThis creates an ironic situation, says Peter, “I’m probably numbing a little bit of my anxiety with alcohol, which is impairing my ability to have REM sleep, which is paradoxically exactly the medicine I need.”\n\nHow alcohol disrupts sleep:\n1—Alcohol is a sedative—You actually “lose consciousness” faster when you put yourself in bed, but you’re not going into naturalistic sleep\n2—Your sleep becomes more fragmented because the alcohol will actually stimulate the fight or flight branch of the nervous system which are wake promoting chemicals making you wake up more frequently throughout the night \n3—Alcohol will decrease the amount of REM sleep that you get \nA self-fulfilling prophecy: \n\nIf you’re downscaling the amount of REM sleep that you get at night with alcohol, you may not be getting the necessary emotional benefit that you need to de-risk the emotional experiences and the anxiety that’s building up\nThen the next night you find yourself reaching for another glass of wine because of the increased stress from not enough REM sleep which then takes away the REM sleep once again\n\nGenetic difference in people in terms of how alcohol affects sleep\n\nAlcohol impacts people differently\nPeter has made the observation in his patients that people are not all identical in how alcohol impacts their sleep\nFor some, the true release of stress from a drink or two might outweigh any potential impact on sleep\nMatthew confirms this observation — if you do some of the genetic testing you can see that some people are fast metabolizers of alcohol (same with caffeine)\nAnd in those fast-metabolizers, by the time their brain is ready for REM sleep, the metabolic consequences of alcohol degradation—the aldehydes and ketones—are no longer present\nOf course, there are also people who have one drink at 3pm and it “crushes” their REM sleep\n\n \nSleep’s impact on the immune system, and implications for a future COVID-19 vaccine [27:45]\nWe know that sleep improves immune function, but have we learned anything new with respect to COVID?\n\nMatt says that we don’t have any direct data yet regarding how a lack of sleep impacts your vulnerability to COVID, or if you are infected, the severity of progression\n\nWhat we do know: There is a very intimate association between your sleep health and your immune health\n\nThis classic study showed that individuals getting less than seven hours of sleep a night are almost three times more likely to become infected by the rhinovirus (common cold)\nA large prospective study of over 50,000 women found that women who were sleeping 5 hours or less were 70% more likely to develop pneumonia (a component risk in the equation of COVID)\nMouse study suggesting a causal relationship: When mice are selectively deprived mice of various stages of sleep (particularly REM sleep) and exposed to malaria, they were far more likely to die as a consequence compared to the well-rested mice\nA study looking at response to flu vaccines found that not getting sufficient sleep in the week before you get your flu shot resulted in producing less than 50% of the normal antibody response therefore rendering that flu vaccination significantly less effective\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13688\"

Sleep deprived subjects had less than 50% of the antibody titers in response to the flu vaccines compared to well-rested controls after 10 days. Image credit: Spiegel et al., 2002\n*Matt’s point: We do need to be prospectively looking at this when the COVID-19 vaccine comes out by tracking sleep—if your sleep in the days before you get your COVID vaccination determines whether or not it’s successful, we should know that and we should be smart about it\nPeter’s take on the COVID vaccine situation:\n\nA vaccine is going to take a little longer than most people think\nIt’s probably not going to be quite as safe as we think\nAnd some of the vaccines, potentially the really efficacious ones, may come with side effects that are undesirable\nLastly, it might be years before we have enough vaccines available to cover all 300+ million US citizens\n\n*Peter’s main point: If sleep could increase the efficacy of that vaccination by 50% (like sleep seems to due for flu vaccines) we should be very focused on that\n\nPeter is hopeful that in the many phase 2 studies looking at coronavirus vaccines that someone will do a subgroup analysis on things like, \n\nHow many soluble antibodies are you getting? \nWhat type of T cell response are you getting? \nAnd can we at least retrospectively look at the sleep quality going into that, if not prospectively?\n\nIt’s very simple to do using sleep trackers (or even just paper and pencil)\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat determines how much deep sleep and REM sleep you need? [36:30]\nSome nuance regarding the 90-minute cycle:\n\nFor the average adult, one sleep cycle seems to be about 90 minutes\nFor some people it’s shorter, for some people it’s longer\nScientists actually don’t really understand what determines the length of your sleep cycle \nBut generally, the larger your brain mass relative to the rest of you, the longer your sleep schedule\nThat said, scientist have no idea why sleep plays out in this 90 minute cycle\n\nWhat determines how much deep sleep and REM sleep you will need/get?\n\nFor deep, non-REM sleep—\n\nHow much deep sleep you need/get is determined by how long you’ve been awake and only a little bit on the basis of your circadian rhythm\nHow long you’ve been away is much more deterministic of i) how much deep sleep and ii) how deep that deep sleep is going to be\n\n\nREM sleep—\n\nREM sleep is much more powerfully determined by the circadian time of night and is less determined by how long you’ve been awake \n\n\nNOTE: We still don’t understand the evolutionary functional reasons as to why Mother Nature drives it in that way\n\nWhat is the role of melatonin, cortisol, and adenosine in how much deep sleep you need?\n\nLittle bit of a function of the accumulation of melatonin\nSomewhat a function of how much cortisol you’ve managed to suppress\nVery much a function of the accumulation of adenosine\n\nAdenosine—\n\nAdenosine is a chemical that starts building up in your brain the moment you wake up\nAnd the longer the amount of clock time that your brain has been awake, the more adenosine builds up\nThis produces what we call “sleep pressure”\nThat pressure, or sleepiness, is the weight of that chemical pressure of adenosine\n\n \nPros and cons of napping, and insights from the sleep habits of hunter-gatherer tribes [42:15]\nPros and cons of napping\n\nNaps as short as 17 minutes can produce learning and memory benefits (unpublished data from Matt)\nAnd you can some benefit from a cardiovascular standpoint as well (unpublished data from Matt)\nDownside of naps is that it can take away which is sleep pressure which could exacerbate nighttime sleep issues\n\nSo who should consider napping?\n\nIf you are struggling with falling asleep at night (sleep onset insomnia), avoid naps during the day \nYou want to build up as much sleep pressure/sleepiness as you possibly can during the day\n\n*Advice for insomnia patients:\n\nFor patients with insomnia, there is something called sleep restriction therapy (part of CBT-I)\nYou should go to bed even later at night in order to elongate the amount of wakefulness to build up an even greater sleep pressure than normal\nAs a consequence, you may only have a six-hour sleep window, but that six hours may be a very constant, solid sleep\nThat 6 hours of consistent, solid sleep is better than lying in bed for eight hours and tossing and turning for two of them\n\n“Quality of sleep matters just as much as quantity of sleep.”\nIn summary: \n\nAvoid napping if you have trouble falling asleep at night\nOn the flip side, if you are not struggling with your sleep at night, there’s no problem with napping regularly during the day\n\nLooking at biphasic sleep by hunter-gatherers\n\nIf you study hunter-gatherer tribes (whose way of life hasn’t changed for thousands of years), they don’t necessarily sleep the way that we do today\nDuring the summer months, they will typically have an afternoon nap\nThis make sense because when you study human brains you see that somewhere between about 2:00 to 4:00 PM we have a drop in physiological alertness\nAs a species, we’re almost pre-programmed to have this enforced dip in our alertness suggesting maybe we should be biphasically sleeping (as opposed to monophasically sleeping) at certain times during the year\n\nHow long is the afternoon nap by the hunter-gatherers?\n\nTypically pretty short, says Matt, less than 90 minutes\nHunter gatherers would typically sleep just six-and-a-half hours at night, and then they would make the rest up with an afternoon nap (which matches most sleep experts recommendation that we get 7-9 hours per night)\n\nIs this like the “first and second sleep” of the Dickensian era?\n\nNo, this is very different to something else that’s been described in the literature, which is “first sleep and second sleep”, documented during the Dickensian era\nPeople would sleep for the first four hours—then they would wake up in the middle of the night to write, drink, socialize, etc.—then they would go back for another four hours of sleep.\nOverall, that sleep pattern was more sociologically-driven rather than biologically-driven. \n\nOther interesting things about hunter-gatherers: \n\nThe concept of midnight—it’s the middle of the night for them, i.e., “mid”-night because they usually go to bed around 8:30-9pm and then they’re awake just a little bit before dawn\nTemperature (not daylight) wakes them up—A rise in temperature seems to happen before daylight starts to break and it seems the regulation of their sleep-wake rhythm is more tied to temp.\n\nComparing humans to primates\n\nIt makes sense that primates have less REM sleep because they sleep in trees \nThey can’t afford a lot of the loss of muscle tone that comes with REM sleep otherwise they might fall out of the trees\nOnce we became safe on the ground, we could afford more REM sleep and the benefits that it provides\n\n“When we became safe on the ground from a sheer Newtonian physics’ standpoint, then all of a sudden REM sleep blossomed and with it, I think a whole constellation of new benefits for the hominid species.”\n \nSleep hygiene, wind-down routine, and tips for better sleep [56:45]\nFive main sleep hygiene tips:\n\nRegularity: Going to bed at the same time, waking up at the same time. \nLight: Getting lots of darkness at night because we are a dark-deprived society (and making sure you get daylight during the first half of the day)\nTemperature: You need to get cool to get to sleep\n“Walk it out”: Don’t lie awake in bed because trains your brain to be triggered by your bed and force you awake because you have a learned association (TIP: If you’ve been awake for 20 minutes, then get up, go and do something else and only come back to bed when you’re sleepy)\nAlcohol/caffeine: Avoid alcohol and caffeine too close to bedtime\n\n“Sleep is much more like trying to land a plane. It takes time to gradually descend down onto that hard foundation of this thing that we call a stable night of sleep.”\nAdditional advice for optimizing sleep:\n1—Wind-down routine\n\nThis is absolutely critical to build it into your routine, says Matt\nMany people in society expect sleep to be like a light switch — it’s just not like that\nA routine might be 15 minutes for some, others it’s 30 minutes\nThings like light stretches, meditation, putting all of your phones and your gadgets away can be apart of the routine\n\n2—Remove clock faces\n\nIf you are struggling with sleep, remove all clock faces from your bedroom\nKnowing that it’s now 2:35 AM in the morning is only going to trigger more anxiety\nThis study from UC Berkeley by Allison Harvey showed that removing clock faces was helpful for poor sleepers with insomnia\n\n3—Remove technology from the bedroom\n\nTechnology (esp. phones) can cause “anticipatory anxiety”\n\nDon’t make checking your phone (e.g., emails, texts, etc.) the first thing you do in the morning\nThis trains your brain in a “Pavlovian way” that even as your tucking yourself in bed at night to expect that anxiety waiting for you on your side table \nThis “anticipatory anxiety” actually lightens your sleep throughout the night because of that expectation\n\n\nTechnology can result in “sleep procrastination”\n\nExample would be scrolling through your phone looking for that next interesting thing and procrastinating the process of putting your mind to rest\nTip from Matt’s colleague, Michael Grandner: If you’re going to have your phone in your bedroom, make it a rule that you can only use it if you’re standing up. After 5-10 minutes of standing you just think, “God, I just want to sit down. I just want to get into bed.”\n\n\n\n4—Set manageable goals\n\nMatt references BJ Fogg, a researcher at Stanford, who looks at behavioral change and applies it to sleep—\n\nIf you are accustomed to checking your phone the moment you wake up, try to start by giving yourself five minutes without checking it\nNext, keep pushing it longer and longer (10 min, 20 min, and so on)\nDon’t set yourself up for failure, ease into it and set yourself up for success\n\n\n\n*Important Note: These tips are for improving your sleep performance, and are for people without a sleep disorder. If you do have an actual sleep disorder (insomnia, apnea, etc.) you need to get help from a physician. \n \nUnderstanding sleep chronotypes and how knowing yours could help you [1:06:00]\nDetermining and understanding sleep chronotype\nYour sleep chronotype simply means—\n\nAre you a morning person? (25-30% of the population)\nAre you an evening person? (25-30% of the population)\nOr are you somewhere in between? (the rest of us 40-50%)\n\nSleep science breaks it into 4 categories:\n\nExtreme morning types\nMorning types\nMiddle evening types\nExtreme evening types\n\nGenetic-component of sleep chronotypes\nEvidence that it’s genetic:\n\n1-There is a significant degree of heritability\n2-There are a collection of genes that will determine, to a degree, your chronotype\n\nGenes that determine your chronotype:\n\nData from 23andMe says there’s about 9 different genes that will contribute to your chronotype \nThese genes are what we call “clock genes”—This refers to the fact that these genes control the rhythm of your circadian cycle\nThese genes control WHEN that sinusoidal wave of your circadian cycle arrives on the clock face\nSaid another way, if you have a certain type of gene compliment that makes you a morning type, your peak alertness is going to arrive earlier in the day and the downstroke of your circadian rhythm will arrive earlier in the evening. \nIn other words, your circadian rhythm looks very similar in its sinusoidal pattern but WHEN the peak and the trough of that circadian rhythm arrive on the 24 hour clock face is very different to a morning type compared to an evening type\n\nEvolution of the sleep-wake cycle over your lifetime\n\nNo matter what chronotype you are, you will change as you develop from a young child to an adolescent teen, to an adult, to an older adult\nMore of a morning type when you’re a kid\nA teen’s chronotype makes your bedtime later and your wake time later in the morning (sleeping more in tota)\nNote: This is a problem for early school start times\nOnce you become an adult, bedtime becomes a little earlier\nAs we get older, we tend to go to bed earlier and earlier (with earlier wake times)\n\nYour innate chronotype can still be twisted/contorted by non-genetic forces \n\nExamples—modern social norms, light exposure, technology, etc.)\nInteresting experiment: A camping study during Winter\n\nAt the end of the week, their melatonin levels began to rise 2.6 hours earlier\nGoing to be much earlier (more than two hours)\nBut they did NOT wake earlier\nAs a result, they got 2.3 hours more sleep (~9 hr was the median)\nNOTE: This may not be realistic to normal life\nAnd if you do the same in experiment in Summer you don’t get as dramatic an effect b/c of so much sun (almost like solstice effect in scandinavia)\n\n\n\nHow to determine your sleep chronotype:\n\nPaid genetic test like 23andMe\nFree online survey: MEQ test – Decent approximation (concordance) with genetic tests\n\nHow knowing your chronotype could benefit you:\n\nLife gets in the way of your ideal sleep times\n(Think parents with young kids, college kids who stay up late simply because that’s the norm for your peers, teens having to wake up early for school)\n\nWith that said, how would knowing your sleep chronotype provide a benefit?\n1—It would explain a lot about why you might struggle so much where other people seem to be just these energizer bunnies\n2—Realizing that you’re not culpable, it’s not your fault\n\nE.g., A lot of night owls have gone throughout life being chastised\nMatt says society really needs to be much more understanding and then also modify how we do things in response\n\n3—It can sometimes explain incorrectly diagnosed insomnia\n“When you fight biology, you normally lose. The way you know you’ve lost is often through disease and sickness.”\n \nNight terrors in kids—what they are and why they happen [1:16:30]\nSleep terrors—what are they are and when they happen\n\nNight terrors are typically where people (mostly kids) wake up with a terrible sense of dread and fear (the child is often inconsolable at that stage)\nMany parents report that young children seem to get sleep terrors (aka night terrors) when they are overly exhausted compared to when they are well-rested\nThe night terror events seem to happen during deep non-REM sleep (i.e., dreamless sleep) rather than during REM sleep (which might explain why the child rarely remembers anything)\nWhen a child spends an extended time being awake or miss a nap (i.e., they are exhausted), they will typically then have a homeostatic increase in the amount of deep sleep\nSo they’re probably going to go into deep non-REM sleep in a more intense fashion or with greater amounts of deep sleep duration\nThis therefore means that the probabilistic likelihood of them having one of these night terrors is increased as a consequence\n\nRecommended pediatric sleep doctors:\n1-Dr. Craig Canapari—the Director of Pediatric Sleep at Yale Medical School. \n\nHe’s written a great book that parents can read about sleep and infants and children\nHe’s got a fantastic website with tons of

his bestselling book, Why We Sleep\nIn this edition, Matthew is addressing some of the errors that made it into his book\nMatt has identified about 13 errors in the book that required correction\nFor context, the book contains over 1,000 facts\n\nFor those who don’t want to wait for the 2nd edition of the book, Matt has written a blog post describing all the errors and misinterpretations in the book along with a collection of detailed scientific literature\nThe following are some of the mistakes Matthew addressed:\n1 | Regarding the association between sleep and cardiovascular disease \n\nThe book stated that a study looked at over half a million individuals, but in fact it was actually 474,684 individuals (so less than half a million)\n\n2 | Regarding the relationship between short sleep and cancer risk\n\nIn the opening introduction of the book, Matt stated that short sleep can double your risk of cancer\nTo clarify, Matt says short sleep does not double your risk of all forms of cancer\nShort sleep is associated with a doubling of a risk of specific forms of cancer, such as ovarian cancer or lung cancer\n\n3 | Regarding the relationship between sleep deprivation and depression\n\nIn a subset of patients with depression, if we deprive them of sleep for one night, we get this really interesting paradoxical antidepressant benefit where it helps them\nIn fact, Matt has gone on to do MRI studies where we’ve tried to understand what is going on in the brain to produce this paradoxical antidepressant benefit\nThe issue in the book is that Matthew stated that somewhere between 30 to 40% of patients with depression will respond to sleep deprivation\nBut since the book was published, there’s been a meta-analysis that’s now shown that it’s not 30 to 40%, but rather 45%\n\n4 | Regarding the relationship between sleep loss and cardiovascular disease\n\nThe book spoke about a study in over 4,000 individuals looking at cardiovascular disease\nBut in the study, it was only a subset of those patients, 2,282, that were analyzed for that analysis Matt described\n\n5 | Regarding the relationship between sleep loss/short sleep and cardiac arrests\n\nMatt stated short sleep was associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrests\nBut in the paper, they were reporting the increase in cardiac events, not cardiac arrests\nSo in addition to heart attacks, it also included other things like angina pectoris that required coronary bypass\n\n6 | Regarding the relationship between long sleep and mortality risk\n\nBackstory—\n\nOne of the things that is clear in the literature is that there is not a LINEAR relationship between sleep and mortality risk\nSo it’s not that the more and more sleep you get the lower your mortality risk\nThat is true up to a point, but once you get to nine hours and beyond, your mortality risk stops going down and actually starts to go up\nThis has led to the misinterpretation that long sleep is bad for you and that it’s associated with a faster death\n\n\nMatt’s interpretation in the book—\n\nThe problem with the large epidemiological studies is that they had not measured all of the different disease outcomes in those studies\nSo when we get sick, the main thing that we want to do is curl up in bed and go to sleep. \nWhy? \nIt comes back to sleep and immune health because when you are sick, you release a whole collection of immune factors, particularly the cytokines that are sleep inducing\nIn other words, these patients were trying to “sleep themselves well” but whatever disease that they had was still too powerful and they still died\nThis artificially looked like long sleep was associated with a quicker death when in fact it could have been that long sleep was the thing that was desperately trying to save them, but failing in the end\nIn the book, that was the interpretation at the time, which Matt still believes to be true\n\n\nThere is now a second interpretation that’s since come into the picture—\n\nThe second way to think about this is that long sleep is also associated with poor quality sleep\nPoor quality sleep, independent of length of sleep, is itself associated with mortality risk\nIn other words, the lower and lower the quality of your sleep, the higher your risk of death\nIt’s also true that when people are not sleeping well, they typically try to stay in bed longer to try and get more sleep because the quality of their sleep is so bad\nIn this scenario, what’s happening is that poor quality of sleep is masquerading as long sleep, which is associated with higher risk of death\nSo it’s not really long sleep that’s the problem, it’s the poor quality of sleep that’s happening which results in people trying to stay in bed longer because they are still tired\n\n\n\n7 | Regarding the claim that the WHO classified any form of nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen\n\nMatt says that this is actually true, that the World Health Organization had classified any form of nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen (and confirmed that claim in a 2019 report)\nFact checkers pointed out that is was actually the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the IARC, that made that statement and not the WHO\nHOWEVER the IARC is actually part of the WHO, so Matt chalks this “error” up as a lack of clarity in his writing\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialThe 3-part podcast episode series with Matt Walker: \n\nPart 1: #47 – Matthew Walker, Ph.D., on sleep – Part I of III: Dangers of poor sleep,
