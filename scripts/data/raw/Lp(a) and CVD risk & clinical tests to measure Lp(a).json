He did postdoctoral research at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam and at the Montreal Heart Institute.  Benoît is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the Université Laval and a research scientist in the cardiology axis at the Centre de recherche de l’Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, in Canada.  \nThe research of Benoît’s team is focused on understanding the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and aortic stenosis in relation to lifestyle and inherited risk factors. This includes extensive research in unraveling the role of Lp(a), HDL metabolism, PCSK9, and lipid-lowering therapies.  [iucqp.qc.ca]"
