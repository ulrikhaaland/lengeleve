  "title": "#69 – Ronesh Sinha, M.D.: Insights into the manifestation of metabolic disease in a patient population predisposed to metabolic syndrome, and what it teaches us more broadly",
  "content": "In this episode, Dr. Ronesh Sinha, a physician, author, and educator based in Silicon Valley, shares his many insights into metabolic illness that he has gleaned from his South Asian patient population. In this conversation we focus on hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, blood pressure, obesity, etc. and ways to address them with nutrition, sleep, exercise, stress management, and more. We also take a deep dive into insulin resistant phenotypes, evolutionary theory and geographic determinants of insulin resistance which provides insight into the genetic architecture and pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. Additionally, we discuss the surprisingly interrelated topic of stress, and how we might be inadvertently passing this on to our children, leading to mental and physical sickness down the road. \nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#69 - Ronesh Sinha, M.D.: Insights into the manifestation of metabolic disease in a patient population predisposed to metabolic syndrome, and what it teaches us more broadly\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#69 - Ronesh Sinha, M.D.: Insights into the manifestation of metabolic disease in a patient population predisposed to metabolic syndrome, and what it teaches us more broadly\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#69 - Ronesh Sinha, M.D.: Insights into the manifestation of metabolic disease in a patient population predisposed to metabolic syndrome, and what it teaches us more broadly\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nHow a stubborn case of insulin resistance connected Peter with Ronesh [7:15];\nRonesh’s clinical treatment focus of metabolic illnesses in South and East Asian patient populations [8:45];\nThe distinction between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat stores [15:00];\nShortcomings of a body mass index (BMI) calculator for evaluating metabolic disease risk [17:15];\nCortisol and blood glucose variability [28:30];\nInsulin’s role in elevated blood glucose: A symptom of metabolic syndrome [33:25];\nMechanistic explanations of insulin resistance (there may be more than one) [35:15];\nTheories on origins and evolutionary reasons for insulin resistance [40:00];\nThe inverse relationship between the amount of brown adipose tissue and rates of insulin resistance, and the role of climate in patterns and prevalence of insulin resistance [49:50];\nVitamin D levels, hyperinsulinemia, and other effects [53:45];\nThe evolutionary benefit of being able to turn fructose into fat (and the price we are now paying for it) [58:00];\nThe VO2 max relationship to insulin resistance and familial metabolic health [59:30];\nUsing zone 2 fitness test to evaluate mitochondrial performance [1:01:15];\nExercise for long-term functional health [1:06:00];\nLifestyle changes to improve insulin resistance and other metabolic phenotypes [1:14:00];\nIs PCOS a manifestation of insulin resistance?

East and South Asian populations have more adipose tissue stored as VAT rather than as “safety belt” subcutaneous fat, putting them at higher risk for metabolic disease. Image credit: (health.harvard.edu)\nThe city versus suburb analogy for subcutaneous and visceral fat\n“The way I explain it to people is think of sort of a city versus a suburb. So the subcutaneous fat is really out in the suburbs, the superficial. The deep is a little bit further in, so this could be basically South San Francisco and the visceral is basically around the organs.”\n\nThe subcutaneous or “suburban” fat structures are organized and have less access to blood supply \n\nRonesh considers this safeguard against having deeper tissue fat stores \nThese fat stores are more inert, with little Free Fatty Acids (FFAs) flux in and out of fat cells (responsible for inflammation)\n\n\nDeeper tissue subcutaneous fat and visceral fat are less organized and have access to blood supply and to the liver \n\nHigh degree of Transmembrane flux\nAnd a resulting presence of inflammatory mediators such as Adipokines and inflammatory chemicals\n\n\nRonesh wrote a blog post about types of adipose tissue, ethnic-specific fat storage, and the health risks that visceral fat stores confer to the Asian population\n\nShortcomings of a body mass index (BMI) calculator for evaluating metabolic disease risk [17:15]\n\nBody type of South and East Asian men and women exemplify how physical appearance does not necessarily indicate metabolic health (Body mass index (BMI) calculator would not be an accurate indication for metabolic health)\n\nMen are typically thin and skinny but metabolic markers are elevated (“Skinny fat”)\nWomen may have more subcutaneous but metabolic markers like TGs and HDL-C are healthy \nTypically in men, unlike for women, the lack of subcutaneous fat insulation means that fat is predominantly stored as visceral fat\n\n\nA study by Mitch Lazar that evaluated a combination resulting in four phenotypes: lean/overweight body weight with healthy/non-healthy metabolic markers, concluded that lean individuals with elevated metabolic markers had the worst outcomes (compared to overweight individuals who were also metabolically ill)\nThe combination of higher proportion of subcutaneous fat stores and larger leg muscles facilitate lipid metabolization \n\nConsidering the lipid overflow hypothesis first proposed by Roger Unger– in which fat storage is favored from subcutaneous to deep subcutaneous then lastly, visceral fat stores – larger subcutaneous fat stores insulate the body \nLarger leg muscles in heavier individuals help process lipids \nSouth Asians are predisposed to insulin resistance in part due to visceral fat storage\n\n\n\nDoes Ronesh observe an association between patient TGs and their glycemic numbers?\n\nPerhaps because patients are still in early stages but elevated TGs does not always present with glycemic impact (high blood glucose)\nRonesh refers to these patients as pre-prediabetic\n\nFatty liver, elevated TGs, often with a family history of diabetes, but their  glucose levels are fine (glucose tolerance)\n\n*Ronesh wrote a detailed blog post on fatty liver in adults and kids*\n\n\nImportant population to educate before becoming prediabetic: they still have preserved beta-cell function (as opposed to Beta-cell failure) and Hyperinsulinemia \nWhen tested, usually present with high fasting insulin levels \n\n\n\n“ …I absolutely get the ones that come in with full blown prediabetes or type two diabetes and triglyceride, but I’d say the majority of the population that I see, they’ve already got fatty liver, they’ve got high triglycerides, but their glucose looks fine. And that is a really important population to really educate because I’m telling them now that you don’t have prediabetes, you have pre-prediabetes and this is where we can make the most impact..”\nThe difficulty in developing a unified theory of metabolic disease\n\nPeter does not like the way diabetes is defined\nThe problem with Hemoglobin A1C:\n\nThere is discordance between imputed average blood glucose from hemoglobin A1C and actual measured average glucose  \n\nUsing calibrated Dexcom (CGM) over the course of 90 days, he identifies patients’ average blood glucose\n75% of his patients have average blood glucose that does not match imputed average blood glucose\nPeter himself is discordant (he hypothesizes due to his beta thalassemia minor) in that his hemoglobin A1C test overstates his average blood glucose compared to Continuous glucose monitor (CGM)  reading\n\n\nPeter does not consider test sensitive enough to evaluate more subtle hemoglobin A1C differences \nRonesh also confirms his clinical observation that the hemoglobin A1C test does not always align with other metrics to evaluate patient metabolic health \n\n\nPatients who exhibit glucose excursions after eating are not treated as high risk for metabolic syndrome when they should be, despite acceptable average blood glucose\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9290\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/figure-2-ronesh-1024x973.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"973\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/figure-2-ronesh-1024x973.jpg 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/figure-2-ronesh-300x285.jpg 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/figure-2-ronesh-768x729.jpg 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/figure-2-ronesh.jpg 1094w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 2.

There could be multiple. We can see arrows and diagrams going in multiple directions. And I realized at a certain point that I need to understand this process, but I’m probably not going to figure it out exactly for each individual patient.”\n\nIn some cases, glycogen store capacity is not physical but induced in utero\n\nThis study in South Asian and Hispanic patient populations with a family history of diabetes develop insulin resistance in utero \nNormal glucose tolerance offspring of diabetic parents\nElevated FFA is an early insulin signal inhibitor for glycogen storage\n\n\nFat flux in the liver may precipitate metabolic syndrome in some cases, but in other cases, patients present with negative symptoms without having fatty liver or elevated TGs\nThere are different categories of insulin resistance that will apply to different patients, although the mechanistic explanations are not well understood \n\nPeter focuses on hyperinsulinemia \n\nHe educates his patients about the endocrine system, explaining four:\n\nThyroid system, Adrenal system, sex hormone, fuel partitioning \nThere is often patient confusion around what fuel partitioning means\nCan simplify fuel partitioning problem by looking at one element of it in hyperinsulinemia \n\n\n Relies on (oral) glucose tolerance test (OGTT), using Glucola – which has limitations (not reflective of physiologic glucose disposal), but is a standardized comparison model\nPeter hopes for better point-of-care insulin testing and mentions that developments are being done in this space to further improve the glucola-type test. \nCGM provides a measure of glycemic response in a real-world setting (whereas OGTT is taken in the morning, not in response to what a patient would ordinarily consume to spike blood glucose)\n\n\n\n\n\nTheories on origins and evolutionary reasons for insulin resistance [40:00]\n“…Because I think even in the early days since I developed it, I had this toxic relationship with glucose, triglycerides…”\nThere have been different theories around the origins of insulin resistance… \n\nJames Neel first proposed the Thrifty Gene Hypothesis \n\nInsulin resistance is a result of human ancestors living in feast/famine cycles\nExcess calories in the body would be stored as TGs, which would be utilized during famine periods\nHowever evidence does not support that primitive humans experienced periods of famine and an actual “thrifty” gene was never identified \n\n\nThe Barker Hypothesis is not based on an actual gene but a gene phenotype\n\nIntrauterine environment (in-utero stress) can trigger insulin resistance and heart disease\nDavid Barker looked at birthweight records in the UK, revealing that birthweight was inversely proportional to mortality for heart disease. This relationship has been supported in every continent, with the exception of Africa\nDr. C.S. Yajnik work on babies in Prune, India reveals early signs of infant hyperinsulinemia \n\nBabies have pot bellies suggesting visceral fat \nSkinfold measures suggest limited amount of subcutaneous fat \n\n\n\n\nDr. C.S. Yajnik proposed the Soldier to Diplomat Hypothesis  in which insulin resistance is an evolutionary adaptation that allows humans to preserve more glucose for brain function\n\nGerald (Jerry) Reaven who coined the term “metabolic syndrome” agreed that there is likely an evolutionary reason to preserve glucose for brain function \n\n\nMetabolic shifts (elevated)  glucose and lipids in utero has a trophic (neural developmental) impact \n\nThe South Asian population are the most highly insulin resistant country in the world \nDr. Yajnik’s research supports that hyperinsulinemia in utero may have some adaptive function to facilitate brain function and cognition (has  positive trophic impact)  \nElevated glucose and elevated insulin can presumably have some impact on increasing IQ and intelligence  \n\n\nIt could be that postprandial elevated blood glucose after a fast/carbohydrate restriction is an evolutionary response to refuel the brain \n\nJake Kushner sent Peter a paper that looked at mechanisms for why refeeding after carbohydrate restriction produces elevated blood glucose\n\nHowever… the analysis did not collect Urinary c-peptide (seemed “underfunded” says Peter)\nTestable hypotheses: if muscle is resistant to insulin or if there is a delayed pancreatic response\n\n\nRonesh’s ideas …\n\nProceeding a fast period, the brain takes priority\nInsulin resistance may occur at the skeletal muscle – which is responsible for 80%-90% of glucose disposal – in order to preserve glucose for brain function\nHe predicts that insulin secretion would be normal\nIn addition to skeletal muscle resistance, there is also likely β-cell dysfunction that contributes to elevated blood glucose \n\nFlooding a system with insulin depresses β-cell function (pancreatic insulin production)\nPatients in early stage insulin resistance already have decreased β-cell function\nPune India fetal studies found that fetal hyperinsulinemia was coupled with underdeveloped β-cell function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA “standard” Caucasian path to metabolic disease = normal → hyperinsulinemic → obese → diabetic \nAsian populations seem to skip the obesity phenotype on their way to becoming metabolically dysregulated \n\nOne reason could be because they predominantly do not present with hyperinsulinemia\nSouth Asian population genetically have decreased pancreatic β-cell density\n\n\nSubcutaneous fat obesity may not be a proximate reason for metabolic dysfunction \n\nLean (low amount of subcutaneous fat) habitus Asian populations still present with metabolic dysfunction\nA study took metabolically dysregulated people who underwent liposuction but did not metabolically improve \n\nLiposuction removes subcutaneous fat but it is primarily the visceral fat stores that play a role in metabolic disease\nThere has not yet been a study in animal models that surgically remove visceral fat stores to evaluate metabolic impact\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inverse relationship between the amount of brown adipose tissue and rates of insulin resistance, and the role of climate in patterns and prevalence of insulin resistance [49:50]\n\nBrown adipose tissue research reveals population-specific phenotypes related to climate\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9292\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/figure-4-ronesh-1024x620.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"620\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/figure-4-ronesh-1024x620.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/figure-4-ronesh-300x182.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/figure-4-ronesh-768x465.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/figure-4-ronesh.png 1294w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 4.
