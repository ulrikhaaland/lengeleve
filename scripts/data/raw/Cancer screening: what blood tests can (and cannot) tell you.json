Peter thinks it’s less about the obesity and more about the metabolic environment that accompanies obesity, i.e. hyperinsulinemia\nThere’s no question that this is a disease that’s heavily impacted by \n\nthe underlying metabolic health of the individual\nthe immune function of the individual, and \nthe ability to acquire mutations and repair them\n\n\nHowever, the metabolic piece is pretty much the only one we can glean anything about from a standard blood test\n\nLabs:\n\nGlucose and insulin \nInsulin primarily being the biggest because it’s a very potent and anabolic growth factor\n\nInsulin, IGF, IGF binding proteins, all of these things factor into cancer \n\n\nGlucose is the preferred fuel of cancer \nMost cancers do not arise from inherited genes (maybe 5% do)\nThe majority of cancer result from somatic mutations (mutations that occur to your genes but they’re not necessarily the genes you pass on)\n\n“The long and short of it is there’s very little in a blood test that’s gonna tell you if you have cancer. What we instead rely on a blood test to do is at least tell us what your metabolic environment is and how much that’s predisposing you to cancer.”\n§"
