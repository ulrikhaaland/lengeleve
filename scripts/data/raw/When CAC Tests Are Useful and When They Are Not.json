It’s all bad.” – Peter Attia\n\nWhere Peter finds the most challenge is with the group think that says if a person’s calcium score is zero then no treatment is needed\nThis gets back to Allan’s paper looking at the 30-year risk and causal model\n\nPublished in JAMA Cardiology in 2018, A Long-term Benefit Approach vs Standard Risk-Based Approaches for Statin Eligibility in Primary Prevention \nPublished in Circulation in 2020, The Expected 30-Year Benefits of Early Versus Delayed Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease by Lipid Lowering\nHe mentions briefly at the outset the example of a 45-year-old person for whom their apoB is higher than they should be; their calcium score is expected to be zero and it is; here the calcium score didn’t really add much information to decision-making \n\nWhen someone is at 7.8% risk, it’s tough to absorb in a meaningful way\nIf the risk was 30%, 1 in 30, that starts to be truly meaningful\n\n\n\n\n\n§<img width=\"167\" height=\"167\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/allan-sniderman.jpg\" class=\"section--guest__image img--circle alignright\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/allan-sniderman.jpg 167w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/allan-sniderman-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px\" />Allan Sniderman, M.D.Allan Sniderman obtained his MD from the University of Toronto in 1965 and then moved to Montreal, where he did his clinical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiology at McGill University. In 1971, he went to the University of California at San Diego to study lipoprotein metabolism with Dr. Daniel Steinberg. He returned to McGill and, with the passage of time, became the Edwards Professor of Cardiology and a Professor of Medicine at McGill University.\nWith colleagues within and outside McGill, he began and has continued a series of studies, which identified the commonest dyslipoproteinemia associated with coronary artery disease- hyperTg hyperapoB. Study of the pathophysiology of hyperTg hyperapB led to studies of the regulation of hepatic apoB secretion and the uptake and release of fatty acids by adipose tissue. He has conducted an extensive series of epidemiological studies, which have demonstrated apoB to be superior to LDL-cholesterol as a marker of the risk of vascular disease. His current research interests are: to understand the regulation of plasma LDL, to create simplified but advanced diagnostic algorithms to recognize and treat those with and those at high risk of vascular disease, and to develop new models to determine the absolute value of different strategies to identify and treat those at risk of vascular disease.\nDr. Sniderman, father of five, grandfather of four, is a committed, but not very skilful, golfer. His most joyful moments have come from learning with his students and colleagues.\nAllan D. Sniderman, MD, is the Edwards Professor of Cardiology and Professor of Medicine at McGill University. He is Director of the Mike Rosenbloom Laboratory for Cardiovascular Research at Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2009.
