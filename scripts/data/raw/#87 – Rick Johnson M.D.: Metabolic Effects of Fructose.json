  "content": "See more content from Rick Johnson, M.D.:\n\n\n\n(January 6, 2020) Metabolic Effects of Fructose with Rick Johnson, M.D. | Part I\n(February 6, 2022) How Fructose Drives Metabolic Disease with Rick Johnson, M.D. | Part II\n\n\n\n\nIn this episode, Rick Johnson, professor of nephrology at the University of Colorado, explains how his research into the causes of blood pressure resulted in a change of research direction to focus more on how fructose has such profound metabolic effects. Rick begins by talking about the relationship between salt and high blood pressure, then provides a masterclass into uric acid, and then expertly reveals the mechanisms and pathways by which sugar (specifically fructose) can profoundly impact metabolic health. From there, he explains how he applies this information to real life patients as well as touches on some of the most promising ideas around pharmacotherapy that are being developed in response to the epidemics of fatty liver, insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity. Furthermore, Rick gives his take on artificial sweeteners compared to real sugar, discusses cancer’s affinity for fructose, and much more.\n<iframe title=\"#87—Rick Johnson, MD: Fructose—the common link in hypertension, insulin resistance, T2D, &amp; obesity?\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LbSic4Oo8ME?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#87 - Rick Johnson, M.D.: Fructose—The common link in high blood pressure, insulin resistance, T2D, & obesity?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#87 - Rick Johnson, M.D.: Fructose—The common link in high blood pressure, insulin resistance, T2D, & obesity?\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#87 - Rick Johnson, M.D.: Fructose—The common link in high blood pressure, insulin resistance, T2D, & obesity?\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nThe connection between blood pressure and fructose that shifted Rick’s professional focus [4:00];\nThe relationship between salt and blood pressure (and the role of sugar) [5:45];\nDefining fructose, glucose, and sugar [19:30];\nAn ancient mutation in apes that explains why humans turn fructose into fat so easily [23:00];\nThe problems with elevated uric acid levels, and what it tells us about how sugar causes disease [31:30];\nHow sugar causes obesity—explaining the difference in glucose vs. fructose metabolism and the critical pathway induced by fructose [40:00];\nWhy drinking sugar is worse than eating it [50:00];\nUnique ability of sugar to drive oxidative stress to the mitochondria, insulin resistance, and diabetes [54:00];\nWhy cancer loves fructose [1:00:20];\nThe many areas of the body that can use fructose [1:05:00];\nFructokinase inhibitors—a potential blockbuster?

\n§\n\n            \n            Show NotesThe connection between blood pressure and fructose that shifted Rick’s professional focus [4:00]\n\nIt started with looking into the cause of high blood pressure\nThe running theory for years was that the kidney has a defect in its ability to excrete salt and so that you end up retaining salt and that leads to elevated blood pressure\nRick then figured out that when you raise uric acid in animals, they developed high blood pressure\nSo what made uric acid go up? ⇒ Sugar, and particularly fructose, raised uric acid\n\n“We started studying fructose and pretty soon we were so excited about what we were finding that we just kind of changed our research direction to focus more on how fructose has all of its metabolic effects.”\n \nThe relationship between salt and blood pressure (and the role of sugar) [5:45]\nDoes salt raise blood pressure?\n\nThe prevailing thought is that too much salt elevates blood pressure\nAnd the advice would be to restrict the amount of salt intake\nBut it isn’t really the salt amount that makes a difference, but the salt concentration\nWhen you eat salt, your serum osmolality goes up\nIf you drink water in combination with eating salt, you can avoid this rise in serum osmolality and avoid the rise in blood pressure\nRick’s 2018 study showed that drinking water with a salty meal will prevent a rise in blood pressure\n\nWhy it would be better to have a lower blood pressure?\n\nWhen your blood pressure is high, you have an increased risk for heart failure and stroke. \nAs your blood pressure increases, you get a gradual increase in risk\nBut when the blood pressure gets around 160 to 180, the risk for stroke goes significantly up and the risk for mortality goes up (like a vertical line, says Rick)\nToday, 120 over 80 is seen as the “optimal” blood pressure for an older person because too low blood pressure can lead to kidney failure\n\nWhat is “essential hypertension”?\n-Peter points out that “essential hypertension” is sort of a waste-bucket term which we use because we don’t know what so many people have hypertension\n-Rick says there have been two major breakthroughs in the last 5-10 years:\n\n#1 – Inflammation\n\nThe key discovery was that the kidneys normally handles salt just fine, but they develop or acquire a change in the kidneys that lead them to hold onto sodium due to inflammation that occurs in the kidney \nThe inflammatory response mediated by both T cells and macrophages injures the kidney ischemically (resulting in reduced blood flow and tissue damage due to reduced blood flow and reduced oxygen) \nAnd it’s that injury that then leads to aberrant (increased) retention of sodium\n\n\n\n“Inflammation in the kidney can be a mechanism for triggering persistent elevations and blood pressure and probably has a big role in the cause of primary hypertension.”\n\n#2 – Autoimmune response to heat-shock proteins\n\nThe inflammation in the kidney, in many cases, is due to an autoimmune reaction to heat shock proteins\nHeat shock proteins are involved in the clearance of mis-folded proteins and they’re helping keep a clean system\nBut what happens is when you trigger injury to the kidney, for example, these heat shock proteins get produced to help fix problems, but the immune system can sometimes get confused and make an immune response that actually is against the heat shock proteins\nAnd when that happens you can develop high blood pressure\nHow prevalent is this?\n\nVery major, says Rick\nThere are genetic polymorphisms that link with the development of primary hypertension and most of them are involved with the immune response to heat shock protein\n\n\nNOTE: Heat shock proteins are not necessarily bad\n\nmany of the benefits we get out of sauna or exercise may be transmitted through these\nYou should NOT stop exercising because the net effect of exercise is still going too far outweigh the potential downside\n\n\n\n\n\n“One of the big breakthroughs has been the discovery that inflammation in the kidney can be a mechanism for triggering persistent elevations in blood pressure and probably has a big role in the cause of primary hypertension.”\nThe role that sugar plays in hypertension\n-In the process of developing high blood pressure there are 2 players:\n\nThere’s the initiators\nAnd then there’s the things that make it persistent\n\n\nThe inflammation in the kidney is involved in the persistence\nIn the initiation, turns out that sugar has a major role \n\n-Rick’s 2013 study showed that when you give a high salt diet to animals…\n\nIt increases the serum sodium which then activates an enzyme that converts glucose to fructose\nThis fructose is made in the body, not coming from the diet\nThe fructose then gets metabolized and raises blood pressure\nIn animals, when you block the metabolism of fructose, you actually block the rise in blood pressure\n\n \nDefining fructose, glucose, and sugar [19:30]\n⇒ Check out Peter’s discussion with Rob Lustig for a deeper dive on this topic\nThe different types of sugar:\nGlucose\n\nBlood sugar is glucose\nIt’s the primary sugar that our body uses to make energy\nWhen that’s too high we call it diabetes\nWhen the blood glucose is too low, it’s hypoglycemia\nIt can be stored in the tissues as glycogen\n\nIn the muscles (once in there it can’t get out)\nIn the liver (about ¼-⅓ of total glycogen) and that’s mostly there to buffer the blood supply in particular to the brain\nIn the kidneys – kidneys store glycogen and produce glucose too\n\n\nWhat does glucose tastes like? A pure drink of glucose?\n\nPeople like it, animals like it, but it isn’t as sweet as classic sugar\nYou can buy dextrose pops (dextrose is another name for glucose)\n\n\n\nFructose:\n\nFructose is a natural sugar found in fruit\nFructose is the sugar that is involved in energy storage rather than energy production.\nWhen you eat glucose, you use that to produce energy…\n…but when you eat fructose, it will actually trigger changes in the body that will favor the storage of energy\nThis is the sugar that animals use to store energy. \nYou store it in the way of\n\nFat\nGlycogen; and\nAnything that will facilitate storing energy is done by fructose\n\n\nThe biochemistry…And fructose and glucose look almost identical biochemically with exception of a couple of bonds but that small difference can have quite different properties\nTaste:\n\nFructose tastes a lot sweeter than glucose\nFound in honey and fruits \n\n\n\nTable sugar (aka sucrose) = glucose + fructose at 50/50 ratio\n\nYou get this when they are bound together\nOccurs in nature in sugar cane, beets, and maple syrup\n\nHigh fructose corn syrup = typically 55% fructose, 45% glucose in soft drinks\n \nAn ancient mutation in apes that explains why humans turn fructose into fat so easily [23:00]\n\nThe proconsul primates lived in Africa ~22 million years ago\nThey are part of the homosapien lineage\nThey ate primarily fruit\nAbout 17 million years ago, there was a change in a global cooling that created a land bridge that allowed many of these apes to migrate from Africa to Europe\nA few million years later, global cooling made it too cold in Europe to have year round fruit\nAnd many of them starved to death\nHowever, a small subset of them developed a mutation in uric acid metabolism that gave them a superpower \nThat superpower was that they could be much more efficient at turning fructose into fat\nThey had this little by-product which they would also make a boatload of uric acid along the way\nThose apes with that mutation returned to Africa and ultimately seeded the rest of the species \nUltimately, that’s why we as humans are among the very rare animals that have uric acid levels that are quite high relative to other animals (cats and dogs, for example)\n\n⇒ Check out Rick’s article in Scientific American: Ancient Mutation in Apes May Explain Human Obesity and Diabetes\n \nThe problems with elevated uric acid levels, and what it tells us about how sugar causes disease [31:30]\n\nThe classic story told is that human’s get gout because of too much uric acid\nAnd we increase our uric acid by eating too much meat and protein\nBut the story is more nuanced, says Peter\n\nHow we get gout:\n-First, what are purines?\n\nWe have proteins, we have fat, we have carbohydrates \nBut we also have things like RNA and DNA which are what we call nucleic acids\nNucleic acids are in the nucleus of cells that help drive gene formation and help dictate the production of proteins\nWhen DNA and RNA are broken down, they’re made up of purines\nUric acid is a purine and it’s basically the ultimate breakdown product of DNA and RNA\n\n-So the way we get gout…\n\nThe way you get gout from protein is from the DNA and RNA in the protein\nThat relates to some extent to how dense the nuclei are. \nIf you have a very cellular thing like a anchovies that have lots of DNA and RNA, you can get gout from that much easier than from other types of meat\nBeer, for example, has brewer’s yeast and that is filled with RNA and so that’s why beer can precipitate gout\n\nUric acid levels in men vs. women:\n\nMen have higher levels of uric acid, generally\nEstrogen helps keep uric acid levels down (so after menopause, uric acid levels go up)\nAlso, men may eat more meat\n\nGout increased by sugar\n“Gout is also increased by sugar” says Rick\n\nIn fact, Sir William Osler observed this in the 1890s\nThe reason is because of the fructose content and when the fructose is metabolized, it generates uric acid\nIn the 1800s, the wealthier populations were drinking beverages sweetened with sugar\nRick wrote a paper where he reviewed how much sugar was put in alcoholic drinks back in the 1800s and it was much more than today\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11506\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sugar-loaf-pub-rickjohnson-1024x531.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sugar-loaf-pub-rickjohnson-1024x531.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sugar-loaf-pub-rickjohnson-300x156.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sugar-loaf-pub-rickjohnson-768x398.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sugar-loaf-pub-rickjohnson-1536x796.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sugar-loaf-pub-rickjohnson.png 1566w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />Figure 1. The Crown and Sugar Loaf. Sugar and fruits were commonly added to alcohol-containing drinks in 17th- to 19th-century England.

Sugar or fruits were commonly added to a wide variety of drinks, including sack and sugar, punch, hippocras and beer. Image credit: Rivard et al., 2013\nThe effect of uric acid on blood pressure\n-Peter credits Rick for making him aware that uric acid can lead to high blood pressure\n-How did Rick discover this?\n\nOriginally, they were studying what causes high blood pressure and some epidemiologic studies linked uric acid with high blood pressure\nWe also knew that there were subtle changes going on in the kidney associated with high blood pressure \nAnd people with gout often have low grade kidney disease\nSo the thought was, “Maybe uric acid could have a role in causing kidney disease through causing high blood pressure through its ability to cause kidney disease”\n\nNext, Rick did a study in rats…\n\nGave rats uricase inhibitor to raise the uric acid of an animal, \nAnd the animals developed high blood pressure\nThen, Rick could lower their blood pressure by lowering their uric acid\nThe original thought was that it was the crystals of uric acid in the kidney, but they looked in the kidney there weren’t any crystals there\nSo then we realized it was an effect of soluble uric acid\nRick then started putting soluble uric acid on cells and saw that it was causing pro-inflammatory effects\n\n-Rick began to think “if fructose/sugar raises uric acid, maybe sugar could have a role in blood pressure.”\n\nNext, Rick did another experiment where he gave rats fructose…\n\nAnd the animals developed high blood pressure \nThey then gave them allopurinol (a drug to lower uric acid by blocking its formation) and it made their blood pressure go back to normal\n“It was like this big discovery.” says Rick\nEven more exciting was these animals also developed \n\nInsulin resistance\nElevated triglycerides in their blood\nFatty liver\n\nAnd when they lowered uric acid, there were benefits in all of those parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“As we studied this, we started realizing that the process by which uric acid is generated is important in how sugar causes disease.”\n \nHow sugar causes obesity—explaining the difference in glucose vs. fructose metabolism and the critical pathway induced by fructose [40:00]\nDifference in metabolism of glucose vs. fructose\n\nAlthough they look alike, the metabolism of fructose is extremely different from the metabolism of glucose\nWhen fructose is metabolized, there’s this process that causes the energy in the cell to fall before it goes up\nNormally when you eat a calorie, we use it to make energy\nBut when you eat fructose, the energy in the cell falls before it goes up \n\n“Fructose is the only nutrient that lowers energy in the cell.”\n-How does that fall in energy happen?\n\nWhenever you metabolize any kind of calorie, we try to break down the food and we use it to make energy, that energy is called ATP. \nATP is the currency in our body that we use to make us run, walk, think, talk, everything\nBut to make ATP, you have to spend a little of it to make it ⇒ \n\nThe process of breaking down and metabolizing food or glucose or fructose requires spending a little bit of ATP before you make it more of it\n\n\nWhen metabolising glucose… you do spend some ATP, but the body has a system whereby it feeds back to stop the process (via an enzyme called phosphofructokinase) before any significant ATP depletion occurs\nBut when fructose is metabolized… the enzyme that metabolizes fructose is called fructokinase\n\nAnd when that metabolizes fructose, it consumes ATP in an unregulated way\nSo if the cell sees a lot of fructose, the ATP levels can plummet by 40 or 50% in the cell\nAnd that produces a “May Day” signal, “we’re under attack, we’re running out of energy!”\nSo it switches the animal into a condition in which they’re trying to preserve their energy\n\nThey reduce their metabolism\nThey reduce their resting energy expenditure\nThey push the calories eaten into fat and glycogen as opposed to making more ATP as a way to protect the body by putting you into a system where you try to store fuel\nAdditionally, it triggers hunger and thirst that makes you want to eat more so you eat more to restore the energy but at the expense that you’re shunting much of it into fat and into fuel storage\n\n\n\n\n\n“Fructose turns out to be used by animals as a mechanism to store fat.”\n–Weight regulation:\n\nNormally animals will regulate their weight beautifully\nIf you force feed an animal to make it gain weight, the animal will go right back to its normal weight when you stop\nIf you starve an animal until it’s below its normal weight and then you let it just eat, it will eat back to its regular weight\nBut when it wants to gain fat… it will do so usually through a mechanism that involves fructose\nA hibernating animal or a migrating bird, for example, will start eating a lot of fruit in to increase its weight\nIt gets hungry, it drops its metabolism so that most of the energy it eats goes into fat. \n“And so this is a very common pattern and it’s driven by that ATP depletion.”\n\nIn summary:\n\nFructose cause a depletion of ATP\nThis depletion triggers a series of reactions\nThe key reaction is that… \n\na) not only does ATP decrease in the cell, but…\nb) intracellular phosphate also falls \n\n\nAnd that activates an enzyme called AMP deaminase (AMPD) that takes the broken down product of ATP (which is AMP) and it converts it to uric acid \nAnd that process has multiple steps, and those steps are involved with the generation of:\n\nIncrease in body fat\ninsulin resistance\nfatty liver\nelevations in blood pressure\n\n\nAnd that pathway is what seems to be critical for inducing obesity from sugar\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11494\"

An oversimplified visual of the process by which sugar consumption can lead to obesity.\nFurther explaining the AMPK vs. AMPD pathway\nThe pathway discussed below is a big part of Rick’s book, The Fat Switch\n-Adenosine triphosphate = ATP\n\nThe T stands for “tri” meaning 3 phosphates\nThe liberation of a phosphate is the production of energy\nThat liberation create adenosine diphosphate (ADP)\nAnother phosphate can be donated to the production of energy which creates adenosine monophosphate (AMP)\nThis is where there is a “fork” in the road…\n\n…Next, it can either:\n\ngo down a path that is driven by something called AMP kinase (AMPK)\nor it can go down the pathway of AMPD\n\n-If it goes towards AMPK pathway…\n\nBurns energy, burns fat\n\n-If it goes towards AMPD pathway…\n\nIt does the opposite, it stores energy\n\n-If you stimulate AMPD…\n\nyou can cause insulin resistance and eventually diabetes\n\n-Whereas if you stimulate AMPK…\n\nyou can actually use that like metformin to actually treat diabetes\n\nWhat drives the switch to tell it which pathway to go?\n\nThe switch towards AMPD is the fallen intracellular phosphate\nAnd the reason that phosphate falls is because it’s taken up by fructose\nThe fructose gets phosphorylated by the ATP and it becomes fructose one phosphate that sequesters phosphate. \nThis is the process where both ATP levels fall and intracellular phosphate falls and that triggers this AMPD pathway\nAnd if you interrupt the AMPD pathway, you can block a lot of the metabolic effects\n\n⇒ Here’s Rick’s study showing hibernating squirrels will activate the pathway for AMPD when it wants to gain weight in prep for hibernation and when it’s ready to burn fat it will activate AMPK\nBack to uric acid:\n\nPart of the pathway through which AMPD is working involves the generation of uric acid\nWhen the uric acid is going up inside the cell it’s doing all kinds of biologic effects and the AMPD is driving that\nOur uric acid mutation compounds our issue\n\nInteresting fact: Dinosaurs also had this mutation and “Sue the dinosaur” actually had gout\n\n\n\n \nWhy drinking sugar is worse than eating it [50:00]\n“Sugar is much more likely to cause obesity if you drink it rather than if you eat it.”\nDrinking sugar\n\nDrinking sugar is much more likely to cause problems compared to eating sugar, says Rick\nThe reason is that when you drink a drink that has fructose in it, we tend to drink a lot in a short period of time\nAnd when fructose gets to the liver, it’s the concentration that triggers this reaction\nIf the concentration of fructose is really low, the ATP depletion may not be significant to drive dramatic metabolic effects\nIn other words… equal amounts of fructose can produce a different effect if both the speed and the concentration are different\n\nIt’s really about the rapidness of absorption:\n\nSo drinking a sugary soda on an empty stomach will be absorbed faster … and that fast absorption really triggers the AMPD\nBut slowly eating a high protein meal with the same amount of sugar as that soda, may not deplete the phosphate enough to really trigger AMPD\n\n \nUnique ability of sugar to drive oxidative stress to the mitochondria, insulin resistance, and diabetes [54:00]\n-Signs of metabolic syndrome include:\n\nElevated blood sugar\nElevated blood pressure\nElevated waist circumference\nElevated triglycerides\nAnd low HDL\n\n\nFructose does all five, says Rick\nAlthough he’s not as clear about the mechanism regarding lowering HDL\n\nHow fructose leads to high triglycerides\n\nUric acid generated by fructose \nFructose also generates a lot of lactate \nFructose also preferentially decreases mitochondrial function and stimulates glycolysis\nAll those things cause big oxidative stress to the mitochondria \n\n–Why is oxidative stress to the mitochondria a bad thing?\n\nThere’s an enzyme in the mitochondria that drives fat oxidation called enoyl-CoA hydratase\nThe oxidative stress inhibits enoyl-CoA hydratase so fatty acid oxidation goes down (aka you block fat burning)\nIn addition, an enzyme called aconitase gets blocked with oxidative stress of the mitochondria \nInhibition of aconitase increases citrate which drives fat generation\nSo you end up with fatty liver that’s driven by both \n\ni) increased fat synthesis and \nii) a block in fat burning\n\n\nMitochondrial oxidative stress also is very much linked with the development of insulin resistance\n\nUric acid’s effect on the pancreas\n\nThe generation uric acid is also causing oxidative stress to the pancreatic islets, says Rick\n\nRick’s study giving rats a high sugar diet:\n\nOne group of rats were getting a low-calorie diet but one that was high in sugar\nAs a control, they gave rats that got the same number of calories but without the sugar\n\n-Results\n\nBoth groups maintained their weight\nIn other words, despite getting 90% of typical calories, they slowed their metabolism enough to maintain their weight\nHowever, the high sugar rats developed fatty liver, hypertension, insulin resistance, and diabetes\nThe high sugar rats got 20% of their calories from fructose\n\n-More observations:\n\nThey first became insulin resistant with high serum insulin levels (what we see in early type 2 diabetes patients)\nOver time, the rats serum insulin levels began to fall, resembling type 1 diabetes\n\nThis is just like humans do\n\n\n\n-Additionally…\n\nThere was low grade inflammation in the pancreatic islets and it was associated with big time upregulation of uric transport proteins on the islet\nWhen we put uric acid on the islets, it induced oxidative stress and over time caused a drop in insulin level\n\n“What we think is going on is that sugar causes diabetes through this pathway that we’ve been talking about and it involves initially insulin resistance, but over time it will cause islet cell dysfunction as well.”\nCould removing fructose solve all our metabolic problems?\n\nPeter: If we were to remove fructose completely from our diet, would all the bad things that happen to us metabolically simply go away?\nRick: Yeah, I think that’s true.\n\n \nWhy cancer loves fructose [1:00:20]\nFor cancer cells… fructose can be an incredible survival nutrient in the setting of near starvation\nRick explains…\n-Many animals get fructose from 2 sources:\n\nFrom their diet; or\nThey make it in their body \n\n-They use fructose to help them survive\n\nFor example, animals use fructose to become insulin resistant as a survival mechanism \nInsulin resistance can be a survival mechanism whereby it increases blood glucose and prevent glucose from taken up in the muscle in order to preserve it for the brain\nThis is exactly what you want to do if you don’t have enough food around, you want to be able to think so you can escape predators, find food, etc.\nSo it was a survival tool to increase energy\n\n-Additionally, fructose also can protect animals from a low oxygen state\n\nFructose will reduce mitochondrial function and stimulate glycolysis which allows the animal to survive with a lower oxygen state\nFor example, the naked mole rat lives in very low oxygen burrows\n\nThey make fructose to survive when they’re in those burrows\nSo the fructose goes up in their blood\nThey use it to survive the low oxygen tension there because they switch from mitochondrial metabolism to glycolysis\n\n\n\n-Why can’t animals just rely more on glucose for which we have such an abundant apparatus to store it at large amounts?\n\nA lot of the fructose is converted to lactic which it can then be converted to glucose \nThen it’s driven through this glycolysis pathway\nIt turns out though that what happens is when you metabolize glucose, a lot of it will go through mitochondrial metabolism. \nAnd so if we can inhibit mitochondrial metabolism (which uses oxygen), we can live off glycolysis (which doesn’t require oxygen)\n\n-But isn’t fructose stored as fat which is the worst fuel for a low-oxygen environment?\n\nWell, fructose is increasing glycogen and lipid, but it’s also reducing mitochondrial use\nWhen you’re eating fructose, you actually are not burning the fat, you are storing the fat\nAnd when coming the fructose, your metabolism switches to a glycolytic state which is helping them to survive low oxygen environments\n\nBack to cancer…\n\nUnfortunately, cancers also live in the low oxygen state\nSo cancers love fructose as their fuel because it helps support them surviving in the low oxygen state\nMany cancers (colon, liver, kidney, breast, brain, all these cancer cells, intestinal) tend to like fructose as their preferential fuel\n\n-If you block fructokinase, many cancers don’t do as well\n\nIf you take intestinal colon cancer, for example, and you put high fructose corn syrup on it, they love it, they grow, they metastasize…\n…But if you block fructokinase and block fructose metabolism, you can block a lot of the growth of those cancers by 50+%\nFurthermore, we know it’s the fructose and NOT the glucose because the glucose metabolism pathway was not blocked at all in that experiment\n“They were able to show that this was driven by that shift from a mitochondrial based metabolism to a glycolytic metabolism.”\n\n \nThe many areas of the body that can use fructose [1:05:00]\nFructose and lactate\n-The more fructose given to a cell, the more lactate will increase\n\nThis is counterintuitive, says Peter…\n…Isn’t the liver the only organ that really has interaction with fructose?\n\nRick says no…\n\nAbout 20% of fructose is used by the intestine\nMaybe 40% by the liver, and \nAt least 10 to 20% can escape into the circulation and cause problems to the kidney for example (The larger the dose, the more that will escape)\n\nAnd the kidneys is a big target once it passed the liver and intestine\n\n\nThere’s fructokinase in the brain\nThere’s fructokinase in the islets \nThere’s fructokinase in the adipose tissue\nAnd maybe even a very low amount in the skeletal muscle\nThe heart can even create it when needed\n\n\n\n\n\n⇒ There was a paper in Nature showing that the heart can even use fructose under some circumstances\n\nThe heart normally doesn’t have fructokinase \nBut when you have a heart attack, the low oxygen state  induces the fructokinase\nAnd there’s probably endogenous production of fructose\nAnd it seems to be involved in cardiac remodeling\n\nCan the brain actually use fructose?\n\nIn theory the brain could actually use free molecules of fructose to make ATP in addition to the mainstay of its energy metabolism, which is glucose and lactate\nThere is actually some evidence that fructokinase is in the brain and that the brain can make fructose\nAnd there’s increasing evidence that insulin resistance can occur in the brain which might be an explanation for the development of Alzheimer’s disease\nThere are reports that AMP deaminase is high in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients\n\n \nFructokinase inhibitors—a potential blockbuster? [1:07:15]\nAre there any people with naturally occurring mutations in fructokinase that render it less capable?\n\nThere’s a condition called the essential fructosuria where they are born without active fructokinase and they live normally\nThese people don’t get type 2 diabetes or obesity\nIt’s a rare condition but that are basically immune to the harmful effects of sugar\n\nIs there any benefit to having fructokinase if you’re not hibernating or in a world where famine is potentially come in your way?\n\nFructokinase was an evolutionary thing that allowed us to survive long periods without food\nSo in the Western world where we have an abundance of food it’s really not necessary\nIn fact, Rick thinks “living without fructokinase would probably solve a lot of the world’s health problems”\n\nFructokinase inhibitors\n\nThere are fructokinase inhibitors that are being developed by Pfizer\nIt was quite successful at treating fatty liver and so now they’re taking that drug to phase three\nPeter says “wow, that’s a potential blockbuster”\n\n \nTreating high uric acid levels—Rick’s approach with patients [1:10:00]\nLowering uric acid\n-If patients have high uric acid levels but are not yet experiencing gout, does Rick still lower it?\n\nYes he does, typically with allopurinol\nSide effects of allopurinol \n\nSome people get severe rashes (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome)\n\nAbout 3% to 4% of Asians\nAbout 2% in African Americans \nAbout 0.5% in Caucasians\n\n\nYou can test for the allergy to allopurinol — HLA B58 test\n\n\n\n–Reasons other than gout to lower uric acid:\n\nIt may improve insulin sensitivity\nIt may benefit kidney disease \nImproves blood pressure (Rick’s JAMA paper showed improvement in blood pressure in adolescents with hyperuricemia)\n\n–What is the target uric acid level?\n\nRisks start to go up when the serum uric acid is over 5.5 for prediabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension, kidney disease, etc.\nMany labs, like the one Peter uses, doesn’t flag levels of uric acid until it hits 7.5 (but this is only through the lens of gout)\nRick will always treat it if the level is 8 or higher\nIf it’s between 5.5 and 8, he generally has the discussion with the patient about the pros and cons of treatment\nFor those with kidney disease, he recommends treatment even at 6.5\n\n–Alternative to allopurinol?\n\nFebuxostat probably works just as good as allopurinol, says Rick\n\nBut some people are concerned about an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality after the CARES trial when compared to allopurinol\n\nBut the problem with that study was that there was no placebo group\n\n\nPlus Febuxostat is more expensive than allopurinol\n\n\n\n \nSalt intake—what advice does Rick give his patients? [1:16:30]\nSalt and blood pressure:\n\nIn general, salt does play a role in blood pressure\nHowever, it’s NOT just about the total amount of salt\nIt’s the combination of salt and water\nYou want to avoid an increase in serum sodium and you can reduce that by drinking water BEFORE eating a salty meal\nExample … If you eat something salty and then you get really thirsty, that’s a sign that you’ve already raised your serum sodium\nWhen you eat salt, you’re making fructose in your body \nAnd the fructose is then driving a lot of effects\n\nSalt and obesity and diabetes:\n\nBut high salt diets aren’t just about blood pressure…\nHigh salt diets are associated with obesity and the development of diabetes\nAnd high salt looks like it works by producing fructose\n\n“What we’ve tried to do is to tell [patients] to drink a lot of water and to reduce their salt, but it isn’t the amount of salt, it’s the balance of salt and water.”\nSalt and kidney disease:\n\nPeople with kidney disease have to be more conscious of reducing salt consumption\nHowever, increased water intake may slow the progression of kidney disease\n\nCan drinking water help keep you skinny?\n\nMany animals use fructose to make fat as a means for making water\nWhen you make fat, although there’s no water stored in the fat, when you burn the fat, it makes water\nWhales, for example, don’t drink saltwater, they drink “metabolic water” by breaking down their fat\nFructose drives fat production in part to preserve water (not just energy)\nIf you take an animal that’s consuming high fructose, you can suppress some of the obesity and metabolic syndrome by giving it a lot of water\n\n“And so the old wives tale that ‘drinking six glasses of water a day is good to help keep you skinny’ is true. It turns out that water suppresses some of the effects of fructose.”\n \nHow excess glucose (i.e., high carb diets) can cause problems even in the absence of fructose [1:21:00]\nWhat advice does Rick have to “healthy” people?\n1 | Reduce fructose\n\nIf we could reduce our fructose intake, it would have a HUGE effect\nUnfortunately, this is easier said than done b/c sugar and high fructose corn syrup are in almost everything (especially processed foods)\n\n2 | Secondly, be careful with other things that are used to MAKE fructose\n\nWe can make fructose from a high salt diet\nWe can make fructose if we get dehydrated\nHigh uric acid stimulates fructose production\nAnd in all these situations, we’re MAKING fructose from glucose\n\nThe glucose-to-fructose conversion\n-If you give high amounts of glucose to an animal… as the glucose hits the liver it induces an enzyme called aldose reductase which converts glucose to fructose\n-Rick’s experiment showed that when feeding mice high glucose it can convert to fructose endogenously\n\nRick took mice and overfed them glucose in liquid form \nThe hypothesis was that they weren’t going to see much since they believed fructose was the culprit \nBut over time these animals got really fat and insulin resistant\nWhen looking at the portal vein, which goes into the liver, the glucose levels were high and that activated aldose reductase and it started to make fructose\nSo even though these animals were eating zero fructose, they were producing fructose in their liver\nFurthermore…when they blocked their fructose metabolism, even though they’re eating the same amount of glucose…\n\nThey’re not getting as fat\nThey have no fatty liver\nThey’re not insulin resistant\n\n\n\n-Does this suggest that you get fatty liver from excess glucose even if it’s not high in sugar?\n\nYeah, absolutely, if you have that enzyme induced\nA young person, for example, this aldose reductase enzyme is really not present in the liver, so glucose will not be nearly as problematic\nOnce you’re eating enough sugar, though, it will induce that enzyme\n\n–Fast forward and says that you eat a lot of sugar and you get obese\n\nNormally, you could reverse the induction of this aldose reductase enzyme within a few weeks by restricting sugar…\n…but once your uric acid goes up that will keep it elevated (regardless of sugar intake)\n\nAnother reason potentially to use allopurinol in addition to fructose restriction to keep uric acid low and mitigate the induction of aldose reductase\n\n\n\n-What happens if a skinny health person lives primarily on potatoes?\n\nIf you give a starch or potatoes to a skinny person who does not have aldose reductase induced, they can eat the potatoes they want\nIn Ireland back in the 1700s, for example, potato was basically the main thing they were eating and there wasn’t a lot of obesity\nBut a high starch diet becomes a much bigger problem AFTER you get metabolic syndrome\nBecause once you have metabolic syndrome…\n\nLet’s say you stop eating sugar but you continue to eat carbs\nThe carbs are going to continue to activate through the same pathway\nThis is why a low carb diet is really great for metabolically ill people \n\n\n\n“A low carb diet. . .is removing the high glycemic carbs that are driving the disease, but it’s through fructose.”\nHow much fructose can be produced in a fructose free intake environment just from glucose?\n\nIt probably takes a lot if you are starting with a young, healthy person\nHowever, if you’ve already triggered the production of the aldose reductase enzyme, you probably don’t have to give a lot\n\nIs excess carbs really the problem? Or it is just excess energy (like from fat)?\n\nIt’s definitely about a particular carbohydrate, says Rick\nThe way fructose works is it works by making you eat more and that’s how you gain weight\nA high fructose diet causes leptin resistance where you want to eat more\nBut when using pair feeding in rats…\n\nYou can control for the calorie intake\nAnd it’s true in that scenario, the animals won’t gain weight\nBut the high fructose, calorie controlled diet will still cause\n\nFatty liver\nInsulin resistance\nMetabolic syndrome\nAnd so on\n\n\n\n\nThe sugar industry will do these studies to say “See! A calorie is a calorie when it comes to weight gain”\n\nBut in real life…\n\nPeople can’t put a clamp on their food consumption nearly as easily in a controlled environment\nEventually leptin resistance causes animals to lose the ability to control their appetite leading to weight gain\nAND… even without weight gain you can get metabolic syndrome, fatty liver, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nArtificial sweeteners vs. real sugar—which is better? [1:29:15]\nIs a diet Coca-Cola better than a regular Coca-Cola?\n\nYeah, says Rick\nWe have taste buds that sense sweet\nWhen we eat sugar, the taste buds are activated and it stimulates this dopamine response in the brain that tells us that we like this sugar\nIf you genetically knock out the sweet taste buds in animals…\n\nThey still like sugar and they will still eat a lot of it\nBut they won’t like artificial sugar\nIn other words, the artificial sugar is driven by the sweet taste but what makes animals like real sugar is through its metabolism \n\n\nSo even though but artificial and real sugar have the sweet taste and the dopamine response, the real sugar gives us some pleasure in the periphery where the metabolism takes place\nAnimals will tend to eat a little bit less sugar when their taste buds are gone, but they still eat enough to develop metabolic syndrome\n\nWhat about weight gain with real vs. artificial sugar?\n\nIf you give a mouse artificial sugar, they don’t gain weight\nBut if you give them regular sugar, they do \n\nStudies looking at aspartame and sucralose\n\nPeter says aspartame has been studied more by the FDA than any other molecule ingested by humans\nSo the idea that we “just don’t know” the full safety profile of these things is a little silly to say\nThere are some studies suggesting risks such as…\n\nLike Saccharin, for example, has been associated with little bladder tumors in mice \nAspartame can generate tiny concentrations of formaldehyde\n\n\nHOWEVER… those studies were really based on rodents consuming doses that simply couldn’t be replicated by humans\n\n“If a person says to me, ‘Oh doc, I’m afraid to drink this diet Coke because it’s got chemicals in it, I want to drink regular Coke because of that.’ That’s an error. Regular Coke is more dangerous than a diet Coke.”\n \nUmami, MSG, alcohol, beer—do these have a role in metabolic illness? [1:33:45]\nWhat is umami?\n\nIt is the savory taste in food\nThere are five basic tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter and savory (umami)\n\nWeight gain and the basic tastes\n\nSweet and salty tastes are the most associated with weight gain\nRick says that for a lab animal to gain weight, it takes…\n\n2 months with sugar\n4 months with salt (slower conversion to fructose)\nAnd then it takes progressively longer in this order…\n\nUmami\nBitter\nSour\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts about umami\n\nUmami is driven by glutamate but it’s markedly enhanced by purines like IMP and even uric acid\nUmami is sort of a taste receptor for uric acid type foods (i.e., Foods that raise uric acid)\nExample, MSG is the purest form of Umami that we eat (found in chinese food)\n\nMSG is the primary stimulant and people put it in foods to encourage food intake\n\n\n\nUmami and obesity\n\nSome link of umami with obesity in epidemiologic studies\nSome situations where you can induce obesity with umami (especially in liquid form)\nPeter’s take: He thinks the idea that umami (or MSG) is harmful is largely unfounded in the literature\n\n-What common foods have umami?\n\nShrimp\nCaesar Salad\n\n-Is umami healthy?\n\nMany websites promote umami as if it’s very healthy for you\nBut Rick says it may not be as safe as we think\nFor instance… if umami foods have a lot of purines which enhance the umami flavor, it actually may raise uric acid and kind of bypass the sugar pathway\n\n-Does Rick add the MSG-containing/high umami foods to the playbook for ways to reduce metabolic disease?\n\nYes, says Rick\nFoods like shrimp, if you eat a lot of them, they probably activate this pathway too\n\nRanking some contributing factors to metabolic disease:\n\n1) Number one is sugar (everything else is less)\n2) High glycemic carbs can be converted to sugar\n\nThe big four high glycemic food to reduce:\n\n1) Bread\n2) Potatoes\n3) Chips\n4) Rice\n\n\n\n\n3) Really salty foods (which can be mitigated by drinking water prior to eating salt)\n\nBeer and umami\n\nWhat makes beer so much more dangerous than other alcohols for inducing obesity is because beer has a ton of brewers’ yeast which basically is activating the umami pathways (which is one of the reasons we like beers)\n\n-Beer belly syndrome:\n\nPeople who drink a lot of beer don’t just get abdominal obesity…\n\nthey get fatty liver\nthey get high blood pressure,\ntheir triglycerides go up. \nThey basically have metabolic syndrome\n\n\n\n“Alcohol, especially beer, can also mimic sugar and it’s probably because of the umami component coupled with the alcohol.”\nPeter’s take:\n“This is the part that can sometimes drive a person insane when they’re trying to think about all of these things…\n…It’s very difficult to provide clear advice to people because there’s so many caveats that are required because the dose makes the poison, the speed of delivery, what it’s combined with all of these things, but I’m using that as a preface to ask a question that I’m sure you get asked a lot, which is really a dose question around fructose.”\n \nFructose consumption—Is any amount acceptable? Is fruit okay? Where does Rick draw a hard line? [1:38:45]\nLiquid fructose:\nIn the form of fruit juices, sports drinks, and sodas, where does Rick draw the line?\n\n“Personally, I would not drink any liquids that have sugar in it or fructose or high fructose corn syrup.”\nHe draws a hard line at liquid sugar\n\nWhat about eating fructose in the form of fruit?\n\nRick has shown that patients on a low fructose diet, that then added in a single fruit to their diet, did just as good as the no fruit group\n\n-What are some low fructose fruits?\n\nKiwi and lime and lemon have almost no fructose\nBlueberries, raspberries, strawberries are very good\n“You can eat a big bowl of blueberries, no problem.”\n\n–In contrast, grapes have a lot of sugar\n\nA bowl of grapes are likely going to raise uric acid and trigger the activation of the this pathway\n\n“What I would recommend is to try to not eat too many fruit at one time.”\n\nIf you eat a huge amount of fruit and get all that fructose it will start to overwhelm the good things in fruit\nGood things like vitamin C, epicatechin, flavonols, and potassium and all these things that help fight the effects of fructose.\n\nWhat Peter recommends to patients: “For patients that have a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, we tend to restrict them to 10 grams a day of fructose, only in the form of whole fruit.”\n\nThis means no grapes, no bananas, no large apples, etc.\n\n \nHow does Rick manage the sugar intake of his young kids? [1:43:00]\nHow does Rick handle sugar consumption for his kids?\n\nFirst of all, things like birthdays, he lets them have birthday cake\nIf they make a cake at home, they will try to sub out some sugar for splenda\nAbsolutely no fruit juice or regular soft drinks\nBut they can have a diet soft drink now and then\nRick says he wants to make sure they understand WHY, rather than just be an authoritarian\n\n“What we try to do is not to be so restrictive that it’s disruptive but we try to be encouraging them to understand that sugar is playing a big role in obesity and diabetes and that it’s unhealthy to eat a lot.”\nTeaching kids about sugar\n\nRick is involved with the Living Closer Foundation which tries to teach children how to look at labels on foods to understand the amount of sugar\nOne experiment they do with kids is to demonstrate that if you put the same sugar in a coke into a cup of tea, it is nearly unpalatable to drink\nBut the carbonation in soda masks this to some degree\n\nWhat is Rick’s take on dried fruit?\nDried fruit is the fructose of fruits without the good things in it\n“…it’s like pure fructose.”\n⇒ Check out Rick’s many publications here\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialRick’s book: The Fat Switch by Richard J.
