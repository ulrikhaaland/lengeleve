  "title": "#212 – The neuroscience of obesity | Stephan Guyenet Ph.D.",
  "content": "Stephan Guyenet is a neuroscientist focused on the neuroscience of obesity and energy homeostasis.  He is the author of the book, The Hungry Brain and founder/ director of Red Pen Reviews. In this episode, Stephan explains how obesity has changed phenotypically over the course of human history as well as what might explain the dramatic increase in prevalence of obesity in the last few decades. He talks in depth about the role of genetics, the brain, and hormones like leptin play in the regulation of fat mass. He dives deep into two common theories of obesity—the carbohydrate-insulin model and the energy balance model and provides his take on which theory has stronger evidence. Additionally, he provides insights on how we’re hard-wired to think about food and the consequences of modern foods designed for maximal pleasure. Finally, he goes through the factors that affect body weight, set points, and provides takeaways for people wanting to take advantage of what we know about the brain’s role in regulating our body weight.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n<iframe title=\"212 - The Neuroscience of Obesity | Peter Attia, M.D. &amp; Stephan Guyenet, Ph.D.\" width=\"500\"

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

\n§\n\n            \n            Show Notes*Notes from intro: \n\nStephan Guyenet is a neuroscientist and a passionate communicator about the science of obesity and many aspects of health\nHis research has focused on neurogeneration early in his career, and more recently, the neuroscience of obesity and energy homeostasis\nHis scientific publications have been cited more than 3,600 times\nHe’s the author of a book published in 2017, The Hungry Brain\nHe’s also the founder and director of Red Pen Reviews which publishes informative, consistent and unbiased reviews of popular health and nutrition books\nHe is a review editor at Frontiers in Nutrition \nIn this episode, we talk about his background and what led him to get to where he is today\nWe talk about obesity and how it’s changed phenotypically over the last thousand years\n\nSpecifically looking at US rates of obesity over the past, probably 150 years\n\n\nWe talk about what the brain has to do with obesity, the role of leptin and the genes that regulate fat mass and obesity\nWe talk about the hedonic aspects of food and how our taste today is different than obviously what our ancestors tasted\n\nAnd how energy and chloric density relate to taste and how we potentially select foods\n\n\nWe discuss the carnivore diet and Red Pen’s review of the carnivore diet\nWe speak about the energy balance model, the carbohydrate insulin model, and unifying theories around adiposity\n\n \nStephan’s neuroscience background and his focus on the nuances of obesity [2:15]\nStephan’s path to becoming one of the most thoughtful people on the nuances of obesity \n\nStepahn was a biochem major as an undergrad, but had neuroscience in mind \n\nHis idea was that biochem would provide a foundation for going into neuroscience later\n\n\nHe did his PhD with Al LaSpada at the University of Washington studying neurodegenerative disease\nHe stayed at the University of Washington for a postdoc with Mike Schwartz \nHe has always been fascinated by the brain, but didn’t know which area of neuroscience he wanted to get into for a long time\nHe became interested in neurodegenerative disease for a few different of reasons: \n\n1 – They’re just absolutely horrible diseases\n2 – His grandmother had Alzheimer’s disease\n\n\nIn grad school he was studying a class of neurodegenerative diseases called triplet repeat diseases\n\nThis includes Huntington’s disease \nThey are also called polyglutamine repeat diseases \n\n\nThe genetics of Huntington’s disease are complex and interesting\n\nIt’s non-Mendelian because the length of the CAG repeat actually changes intergenerationally\nThe weird thing about it is these CAG repeats are unstable in replication\n\nTheycode for polyglutamine structures in the protein \n\n\nYou tend to see an enlargement of these polyglutamine repeats from one generation to the next\n\nSo it has this really weird non-Mendelian pattern\n\n\nThe penetrance is pretty high, meaning if you have this repeat of a certain length, you are going to develop disease\n\nBut it’s not 100% fixed\n\n\n\n\nStephan was studying a less common disease called SCA7, spinocerebellar ataxia type 7\n\nNot many people have this disease\n\n\nHe had always been interested in fitness and nutrition\nSo when he started learning about the neuroscience of obesity during his PhD work, he got really into it\n\nThis was a way to satisfy his desire for impactful research\nHe realized there was a ton of information on this topic that was incredibly enlightening and not making its way to the public\n\n\n\nAt what point, finishing up your PhD did you connect with Mike?\n\nHe was interested in obesity and wanted to stay at the University of Washington for personal reasons\n\nStaying at the same institution after your PhD is atypical but he was not a big fan of the typical academic thing\n\n\nMike’s lab was a really good fit\n\nHe was a postdoc with him until 2013\n\n\nPeter remembers meeting Stephan at a conference in 2012, 10 years ago\n\n \nHow obesity has changed for humans throughout history [8:00]\n\nHumans have been around for maybe 6 million years\n\nWhat has changed over the last 1000 years in terms of our phenotype? \n\nThinking of body shape of people in modern, affluent societies (like the US) compared to a typical human 1000 years ago, we are much fatter\n1000 years ago there was obesity among the wealthy, probably for similar reasons that we have obesity today\n\nThere is evidence of this from Egyptian mummies\nCertainly the prevalence was much lower\n\n\nJust to be clear, we’re defining obesity in the most traditional way as a BMI (body mass index) of more than 30\n\nThe advantage of BMI is it’s really easy to measure and you can calculate it from these really simple measures that go back a long time\nUnfortunately they didn’t have DEXA machines in 1890, which would’ve been a more informative way of looking at it\n\n\n\nHow BMI has changes in recent history\n\n120-130 years ago only a few % of people (low single digits) had a BMI > 30\nMore recently, we start to have really good data in the US in 1960 when the NHANES (national health and nutrition examination survey) began\n\nThe % of people who are obese by this measure has gone up from the late 1800’s to maybe 12% of adults in the US\n\n\nThe category of extremely obese refers to a BMI over 35\n\nThere is class 1, class 2, and class 3 obesity; these correspond to a BMI of around 30, 35 and 40 (see the table below)\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\"

491px\" />\nFigure 1.  Basic BMI categories.  Image credit: Wikipedia\n\nMore recently, the median BMI has increased too\nThe most extreme changes happened in the more severe obesity category\n\nVery few people had BMIs > 35 in the earliest measures\nToday 9-10% of adults have a BMI > 35\n\n\nThe distribution of BMIs used to be a lot tighter too; today it has spread out\n\nThis difference is illustrated in the figure below, where the blue line can be thought of as the ancestral distribution of BMI and the red line the current distribution of BMI\nThe blue line shows a tighter distribution where the standard deviation is less than the red line (a larger standard deviation)\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18419\"

in a population.  Image credit: Statistics by Jim\n\nThere are still people in every BMI category but since it is more spread out, there is a disproportionate increase at extreme values (illustrated in the red curve above)\n\nIs this true for the underweight category?\n\nTypically the cutoff for underweight is 18.5\nStephan is not sure what the fraction of this category would be in 1900; he thinks it was higher than today\n\n \nThe association between obesity and adverse health outcomes, the “obesity paradox,” and confounders when relating BMI to longevity [14:00]\n\n1000 years ago, Egyptian aristocrats would have viewed obesity as a sign of affluence\n\nIn medical school, Peter remembered learning how gout emerged about his time\n\nThis is a disease of excess‒ excess alcohol, excess sugar, excess protein\nThis was a rich man’s disease \n\n\n\n\nThere were physicians in ancient Greece, in India, who recognized that being very heavy was associated with health problems, such as having sweet-tasting urine (a sign of type 2 diabetes)\nThere were insurance life tables in the early 1900 that suggested that people who had obesity had shortened lifespans and greater risk of certain diseases\nThis became controversial with a series of studies about the “obesity paradox” that Katherine Flegal was involved in\n\nThis was discussed in a recent episode, #197 – The science of obesity & how to improve nutritional epidemiology | David Allison, Ph.D.\nIn these studies, looking at a graph of the relationship between BMI and longevity, the nadir (the lowest point on the graph) was in the overweight range (shown in the figure below)\nThis finding was repeated in meta-analyses of millions and millions of people\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18420\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f3-guyenet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"669\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f3-guyenet.png 720w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f3-guyenet-300x279.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" />\nFigure 3. The relation between longevity and obesity in humans.  Image credit:  PNAS 1958\n\nThis had people suddenly saying, “Well, maybe higher body fatness is not bad. Maybe it’s actually protective.” \nThe reason this is called a paradox is because there is lots of evidence that excess body fat contributes to all kinds of diseases: type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers\n\nHow could obesity be productive for mortality when it’s driving all these diseases that are the leading causes of mortality? \n\nThis is why it’s called the “obesity paradox”\n\nResearch has come out since then suggesting this is an artifact of the observational data \n\nThere are probably a few things going on\nThe biggest one is, people who are sick often lose weight\nThere are lots of health conditions that cause people to lose weight: poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Alzheimer’s disease, cognitive decline\n\nLeanness can be confounding\n\n The concern was, this makes leanness look worse than it really is \n\nMany people in the lean category are not sick\n\n\nPeople have called this reverse causation, but David Allison corrected him; the technical term is confounding \n\nPeter’s recent surgery is an illustrative example\nHe had shoulder surgery less than 3 weeks ago\nIn the 18 days since his surgery, he’s lost 9 lbs\nHis BMI probably went from 26 to 24\nOn paper, this looks good, but he would argue there is nothing superior about his health today compared to 18 days ago\nOf the 9 lbs he’s lost, probably 7 lbs were lean body mass\n This shows how an improvement in BMI can occur with a deterioration in body composition \n\n\nBMI is a crude measure but it’s useful for a population-level study\n\nIt can be useful for screening\n\n\n\nHow do you get around the issue of confounding?\n\nStephan likes one method developed by Andrew Stokes and his colleagues\n\nThis is the maximum attained weight method\nInstead of correlating your current BMI with mortality risk, it asks the question “What’s the heaviest you’ve ever been, and how does that correlate with your health outcomes?”\nThis aims to screen-out an health conditions you may have developed that might have caused you to lose weight\n\n\nWith this method, it sharpens the association between BMI and mortality\n\nThe nadar (lowest point on the graph of lowest longevity) now shifts to a lower BMI\n Now a BMI in the lean range looks best \nFurther, there is a larger difference between being the mortality of people who are lean and those who are obese\nThis analysis excludes a bunch of people who were formerly in the obese category; it puts them in a lower category\n\nTheir health outcomes are terrible\nThose who used to be classified as obese are now just overweight or lean\nBut they have massively elevated rates of chronic disease and mortality\n They are bringing all this excess mortality into the lower weight categories  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis sounds like horrible news.  It suggests that if your BMI is 33, all hope is lost.  If you bring your BMI down to 26, you don’t assume the health of people in this category.  This doesn’t sound right either. \n\nAnother limitation of the observational data is it’s hard to lose a lot of weight\n\nAnd keep it off\nIt’s hard to go from a BMI of 35 to 25\n\n\nPeople who are losing weight have predominantly unintentional weight loss\n\nHow does bariatric surgery affect this?\n\nThe data for people with type 2 diabetes taking semaglutide indicate this reduces all-cause mortality in a meta-analysis of randomized control trials  \nStephan notes, “It will be interesting to see whether that extends to people without type 2 diabetes” \n\n \nThe sharp increase in obesity across demographics [23:30]\nFrom an epidemiologic standpoint, when do obesity rates take off? \n\nBack in the 60s we may have been at 12% obese\nIt’s hard to imagine this low figure given today it is 43% obese\nStephan points out, “Probably a lot of people listening will have seen graphs of NHANES data where it kind of spikes around 1980.” \n\nThe 1980 data was actually a multiyear survey that spanned somewhere around ‘76-‘84\n1978 was about the average of that data\nToday the range is much narrower\n\n\nSo we don’t know exactly when obesity rates began to go up, but it is somewhere in the range of ‘76-‘84\nCurrently we have a sharper focus on changes in dietary intake because of the annual data from the USDA Economic Research Service \nThe data on BMI are less sharp\nDuring this time period (‘76-‘84) big changes happen to the diet\nSomewhere from the late 70s – early 80s obesity went from around 15% to 43% of US adults\n\nThis includes people where 20 years old\nSo if you look at the lifetime risk, it’s well over 50%\n\n\n\n“More than half of US adults will be classified as actually having obesity at some point in their life if the current context is maintained”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nThe same is true for type 2 diabetes\n\nThe prevalence of all diabetes is around 10-12%\nThe lifetime risk is double that‒ it’s mind blowing the number of people who will, at some point in their life, develop type 2 diabetes \n\n\nPeter adds, over the last 50 years, if you consider the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, this disease has gone up 5-fold\n\nIn the US (and developed nations), obesity is no longer a condition of affluence at the individual level \nHow does obesity in the rest of the world compare to the US? \n\nThere is still not a lot of obesity in the poorest people in the world\n\nPlaces challenged with food security, where the diet is very limited\nSuch as subsistence farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa\n\n\n\nIf you looked at the bottom 10% of the population economically in the US and compared it to the top 10% economically, is there a difference in obesity? \n\nYes\nBut if you’re looking in tertiles to compare the bottom third to the top third, there’s very little difference\nYou can start to see larger differences emerge when you start analyzing it by sex and race\n\nWomen in the top tertile are leaner than women in the bottom tertile\nThere’s no difference for men in terms of income\n\n\n\n“My overall feeling though, is that there is no demographic in the United States that has not gotten a lot fatter over the last few decades”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n \nThe hypothalamus and its role in obesity [30:00]\nWhat does the brain have to do with obesity? \n\nRudy was on the podcast 2-3 years ago, so now is a good time to review the neurobiology of the hypothalamus and its regulation of energy expenditure and appetite\n\n#33 – Rudy Leibel, M.D.: Finding the obesity gene and discovering leptin\n\n\n1 – The brain is the organ that generates behavior\n\nBehavior relates to body fatness in terms of how much we eat, how we use our bodies, how we sleep, whether we’re stressed or not\n Most people would agree that food intake, quantity and quality are pretty important \n\n\n2 – The brain contains a regulatory system for body fat mass\n\nThis is located in the hypothalamus, which has been described by Herman Pontzer [in his book Burn] as being “like a wad of bubble gum on the bottom of your brain near where your optic nerves cross, so it’s this little tiny part of the brain that specializes in homeostasis or maintaining the stability of body systems” \n\nPeter describes it as a walnut\n\n\n\n\nThe hypothalamus regulates body temperature\n\nThere’s a thermostat in there and thermometers that measure your core temperature \n\n\nThermometers on your skin measure future threats to your core temperature\n\nFor example, if you jump into a cold lake, your core temp doesn’t instantly drop\nBut your brain knows it will drop because of the temperature sensors in your skin\nSo your brain can respond adaptively\nThe hypothalamus engages a suite of behavioral and physiological responses to maintain temperature homeostasis\nOn the physiology side, you get vasoconstriction, nonshivering thermogenesis through brown fat, shivering\nAnd then through the behavioral side, you want to get out of the cold water, put a sweater on, drink some hot tea; you want to adopt a heat-conserving posture\n\n\nThrough this coordinated physiology and behavior, you get incredible regulation of temperature, of core temperature plus or minus 1o F when the exterior temperature could be varying by 50o  \n\nThis is an example of the type of regulation the hypothalamus specializes in\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the body fat regulatory system is not so precise\n“A nice name for that is the lipostat”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nA nice name for the regulatory system for body fatness is the lipostat \nLipo meaning fat and stat meaning the current state of \n\nEvidence of the connection between the hypothalamus and obesity \n\nIn 1840 the Viennese physician Bernhard Mohr published a case study about a woman who had extreme obesity, rapid onset extreme obesity\nHe did an autopsy after her death, and she had a tumor in her hypothalamus\n\nHow much of her obesity was due to hyperphagia (excess eating) versus loss of activity or shutdown of metabolic rate? \n\nThe closest experimental analog of hypothalamic obesity would be VMH (ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus) lesion\n\nThis lesion has been performed very precisely in animals since the ‘20s using a stereotaxic device \nAs soon as the anesthesia wears off, these animals are cramming food into their faces\n\nIf there’s no food in their cage, they’ll eat bedding\nThey have extreme hyperphagia\n\n\nThey continue binging until they have rapidly gained a large amount of weight (it will start to plateau off)\n\n\nExperiments have been done with animals that have a VMH lesion\n\n1 – If you restrict them to a normal level of calorie intake, it prevents weight gain\n\n This suggest that weight gain is due to hyperphagia (excess eating) \n\n\n2 – Later experiments showed that control of calorie intake didn’t completely eliminate weight gain, only about 80% of the weight gain was eliminated\n\n This suggests an energy expenditure component  \nThe weight gain is thought to be mostly due to hyperphagia but also in small part, to changes in energy expenditure\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat have we learned about the lipostat and circulating factors that might play a role in governing it?\n\nThe simple explanation‒ there is a negative feedback system in the hypothalamus (similar to your home thermostat) that measures levels of a circulating hormone called leptin\n\nLeptin circulates in proportion to your body fat mass\n\nSo the same way your home thermostat measures the temperature in your home, your hypothalamus is measuring the level of leptin in your circulation\n\n\nThere’s still some controversy about how exactly or where that measuring happens, but the signal gets to the hypothalamus\n The hypothalamus determines if you have the amount of fat it wants you to have \n\nSo the same way that your thermostat has a set point and your internal thermostat in your body has a set point, your hypothalamus has a certain idea of how much fat it wants you to have on your body\nIf you deviate from that, it starts to engage a coordinated series of physiological and behavioral responses to restore the previous level of body fat\n\n\n\n\n\n“This system works better at protecting against fat loss than it does against fat gain”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nOver long periods of time, the average person in this country tends to gain fat\n\nThe lipostat is not preventing this, it might be resisting but will not stop the process of weight gain\nThe lipostat will vigorously defend against weight loss\n\n\nStephan notes, “This is part of the cruelty or the unfairness of how obesity works… your set point is your defended level of body weight”\nThere is controversy about what to call the set point, but your body and brain will defend against weight loss as if you were starving\n\nThis happens in both lean and obese \n\n\n\n“A person with obesity, their body defends against weight loss as if they were starving”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nIt’s literally a starvation response\n\nIt’s the same behavioral and physiological process that ramps up your hunger\n\nIt makes you more focused on food queues, with greater cravings\n\n\nIt downregulates your energy expenditure\nIt does everything it can to try to bring the fat back, \n\n\n\nThat is a key reason and possibly the primary reason why weight loss is so difficult and so temporary \n\nWithout this regulation, weight loss would probably be pretty easy\n\nWeight maintenance certainly would be easy, but it’s not\nPeople tend to regain back to their former level unless there extremely well-supported in that weight loss\n\nAnd even then there is usually some amount of weight regain\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe role of the hormone leptin in obesity [40:00]\nLeptin is made in the adipocyte and secreted in proportion to body fat mass \n\nThe more adipose tissue you have, the more leptin you have\nLeptin is also strongly impacted by short-term energy balance\n\nLet’s say cut your calories by 25% for a couple of days, you’re going to see a drop in leptin that is disproportionate to your amount of fat mass\n\n\nThere are leptin receptors in many parts of the body, but the ones that are relevant for body weight regulation are in the brain\n\nThere are a high concentration of leptin receptors in the hypothalamus\nThey’re in other parts of the brain too\nIt’s not 100% clear where the important ones are for body weight regulation\n\n\nIn mouse models where the leptin receptor is knocked out (removed) from the GABAergic cells, the animals respond as if they don’t have leptin receptors at all (in terms of weight gain)\n\nGABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain\n\n\nYou can knock the leptin receptor out of certain cell subtypes in the hypothalamus and get big effects\n\nOne paper suggested you can just knock it out of AgRP neurons and recapitulate the obesity phenotype of animals that have no leptin receptor\n\nThis is controversial, not all papers show this\n\n\n\n\nProbably the most important cells with the leptin receptor are in the hypothalamus\n\nThe hypothalamus receives this message and conveys it to the key cell types at the center of this lipostat‒ the AgRP neurons \n\n\nIn his book, Stephan refers to the AgRP neurons as NPY neurons (for simplicity)\n\nMore commonly they’re called AgRP neurons and POMC neurons\nThe AgRP, those are the hunger neurons\nThe POMC, those are the satiety neurons\n\nOr you could think of them as hunger/body fat-increasing neurons\nThe POMC are essentially the opposite of the AgRP\n\n\n\n\n\nExplaining leptin resistance \n\nLeptin was discovered first in 1994 by a team led by Jeff Friedman and Rudy Leibel\n\nThey found this was the gene missing in an obese mouse model called the ob/ob mouse\nThe animal was extremely obese as a result of lacking a defect in the production of this protein (leptin)\nOne single base pair that destroyed this protein and caused loss of function and this massive obesity\n\n\nThere was a scientific bonanza when it was discovered and that humans too have leptin\n\nMany thought that maybe people with obesity don’t have enough leptin, so their brains think they don’t have enough body fat when in reality they do\n\n\n The failure to perceive the body fat, that’s what causes obesity in these ob/ob mice\nThey started measuring leptin levels in people with obesity, and it turns out they were actually elevated\n\nWe now know that leptin levels are correlated with fat mass \nWhat’s the deal? If this is a hormone that regulates body fatness, why is it that people with obesity have so much of it and it’s not suppressing their excess body fat mass?  \n\nThe concept that has been invoked to explain this is leptin resistance \nSo in the same way that people can develop insulin resistance where it takes more insulin to do the physiological jobs in the body, people with obesity require more leptin for the hypothalamus to be satisfied \nExplained another way, obese people require more leptin to avert the starvation response \n\nWhere the brain has alarm bells that start going off because it thinks you don’t have enough body fat\n\n\nQuestions about leptin resistance:\n\nAre there fewer leptin receptors on a certain kind of cell?\nIs their impairment of downstream signaling affecting intracellular signaling cascades?\nIs there a change in cell to cell communication?\n\nMaybe the cell that’s receiving the leptin is getting the message just fine, but there’s some kind of downstream change in neural processing where the signal gets clouded or modified\nWe don’t know the answer to that question\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter’s summary: we know the problem in obesity is not that leptin levels are too low because of 2 observations \n\n1 – There are high levels of leptin in circulation in obese people\n2 – Giving obese people exogenous leptin doesn’t improve their condition\nStephan notes, “You can give high levels of leptin and it will cause weight loss, but it doesn’t do much”\nEarly animal studies of leptin signaling in the hypothalamus suggest that the intracellular signaling cascade activated by leptin is not impaired in obese animals\n\n“It’s like they’re getting the same leptin signal from a much higher level of leptin”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n \nThe genetic component of obesity [46:30]\n\n\n\nPeter notes, studies in identical twins ( MZ twins) show obesity has a heritability of 0.7 \n\nHe was surprised at how large this is\nThis level of heritability tells you that something is very, very genetically predetermined\nSo even though 100 years ago, virtually none of us were obese, today your lifetime incidence of obesity if 50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Our genes haven’t changes in 100 years, so clearly our susceptibility for obesity has been with us for a great period of time and is highly preserved \n\nWhat in our environment in the last 50 years has allowed obesity to flourish?  What do we know about the genes that regulate obesity? \n\nMeta-analysis of twins studies suggest an average heritability of 75% for obesity\n\nThe heritability of body mass index (BMI) is very high\nAbout 75% of those differences between people is explained by their genetics\n\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to ask the question, “If we look at the entire genome, and we look at these representative genetic markers where different people have different genetic code called SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), where in the genome/ what markers correlate with differences in body mass index?” \n\nBMI is really easy to measure, so you can get really big sample sizes in this studies\n\nThis is needed to get statistically significant results\nYou’re looking at millions of people\nThere are also a lot of genomic markers, so tremendous statistical power is needed to detect anything with a high level of confidence\nThe latest of these studies is on the order of 800,000 people\n\n\nAn example of studies that have saturated heritability are GWAS studies of height; they looked at around 3 million people\n\nThese studies have gotten all the information they can about common genetic variants that correlate with differences in height\n\n\nStephan thinks studies of BMI will be saturated in the near future\n\nSoon we may know all the common genetic differences that correlate with differences in BMI\n\n\nSo far, GWAS have identified 900 venetic variants\n\n This suggests that differences in BMI between individuals are genetically very complex \nBMI is determined by a lot of different genes with very small effect sizes\n So you’re getting this sorting of all these different genes and whatever combination you get determines whether you are susceptible or not to obesity in a fattening environment \n\n\n\n\nThere are various ways of looking at what these genes are doing\nOne is to look at the underlying biology that makes some people fatter and some people slimmer\nIf you look at people in their regular everyday context, you can ask what genes correlate with a high BMI or a low BMI\n\nThese studies are very naturalistic and replicable (meaning, if you do 3 studies of this nature, you tend to get similar results)\nThis is a rigorous and objective study\nIt’s not hypothesis-driven so there is little bias\nIt’s simply looking for a correlation\nPeter adds, “Part of that comes from the strength of what ultimately makes genetic analyses like Mendelian randomization so powerful is the genes are randomly distributed…you are looking at a million people for whom the genes are randomly spread across them” \n\nIt’s very powerful if you get the same results over and over again from an unbiased sample\n\n\n\n\n\nBMI is linked to brain biology [52:15]\nFrom a teleological viewpoint, why is it that only 50% of us will become obese in our lifetime?  Why not 100%?\n\n1000 years ago, none of us were obese but 50% of us had the genes that would allow us to become obese in an obesogenic environment\nStephan adds the intuitive question, “Why can some people effortlessly stay thin and other people have to really struggle to maintain their weight and maybe are not able to”\nLooking at genomic differences, one can identify genes and the tissues where they are expressed\nThere was a paper that looked at 48 different traits of all kinds of diseases, personality traits, other stuff; they asked “What does the tissue enrichment look like?”\n\nIf you look at body mass index, it looks like psychiatric diseases and educational attainment\nAll of those are heavily enriched for brain-related genes to a similar degree\n The biology of BMI is heavily enriched for brain-related biology \nPeter adds that psychiatric diseases are some of the most heritable in medicine; schizophrenia has a heritability index of 0.6-0.7 (or more)\nThese parallel characteristics are highly genetic and disproportionately concentrated in the brain\n\n\n\nStephan’s takeaway: We don’t really know exactly how the brain is doing this, what it is about these genes, but we can see that it correlates with certain types of ways of interacting with food \n“People that have obesity promoting genes tend to have greater eating drive”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nPeople with obesity promoting genes also tend to have lower satiety\n\nBut this hasn’t been explored very well yet\n\n\nIf you look at the monogenic obesity syndromes (where there is 1 mutation that causes severe obesity), those really revolve around the leptin brain signaling axis\n\nMutations tend to be in: leptin, the leptin receptor, melanocortins, the melanocortin receptors (which are downstream of leptin in the brain)\nThese are the types of signals that show up in genome-wide association studies\nBut they’re not dominant; a lot of this stuff is really general\n\nIt’s things that affect general neuronal development and neurotransmitters\nThese are involved in a lot of things\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot to learn about how these genes are involved in obesity; but what we can say is‒ differences in body fatness between individuals are primarily determined by differences in how the brain is constructed and how it operates \n“There’s a long way to go before we really understand exactly how those genes are affecting the brain in a way that impacts body fatness”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n \nUnderstanding the tendency of humans to store fat through an evolutionary lens [57:00]\nHow leptin fits into a teleological perspective \n\n250,000 years ago, for all intent and purposes we were the same creatures then as we are now\n\nThe difference is our environment\n\n\nIn that time, food and energy are on of our top priorities\n\nAcquisition of energy was essential in that it could kill you very quickly if you failed to do that\nAcquiring energy and storing it was a struggle that defined us in the short term probably more so than reproduction\n\n\nThinking of leptin in this environment, it is a signal saying there is not enough energy \n\nSo it’s not surprising that high leptin doesn’t make you want to stop eating\n\nThis is not the problem that humans faced in the past\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, nature would care about low leptin levels \n\nLow leptin levels should be a screaming signal to go and eat\n\nWhat is known about the efficiency with which we store energy? \n\nHumans have a remarkable ability to get fat\nWe don’t really store carbohydrates, we can’t really store protein since we don’t want to break down muscle to get amino acids\nWe rely on the ability to store fatty acids\n\nExcess carbohydrates are stored as fatty acids in a relatively inert structure of white adipose tissue\n\n\nStephan replies, “I think Herman Pontzer would be a great person to talk to about this” \n\nHis book [Burn: New Research Blows the Lid Off How We Really Burn Calories, Lose Weight, and Stay Healthy] is on Peter’s list to read  \n\n\nJohn Speakman would also be a good person to talk to\nThere are good reasons to have a certain amount of body fat\n\nThis provides a way to cover your energy needs between eating opportunities\nGlycogen is another energy reserve, but is is far more limited\nThe awesome thing about fat, it’s a concentrated source of energy\n\nDietary fats are 9 calories per gram, carbohydrates are 4, proteins are 4\nFat is anhydrous, there’s not water, just energy\nFat is hydrophobic, it can be stored without having to hydrate it like you have to do with glycogen\nThe weight of glycogen is mostly water\nFor adipose tissue, 85-90% of the weight is fat; the energy density is really high\nPeter agrees, “there’s no battery that can come close to the energy density of our fat… or any hydrocarbon for that matter”\n\n\nWe also need fat reserves for times of illness\n\nThe primary causes of mortality in children under 5 in low-income environments is strongly related to their weight for height (a different way of measuring BMI) and disease pressure\nIn children, diseases like diarrhea interfere with nutrition\nKids with moderate or severe malnutrition are underweight and have massively increased mortality because they lack the energy stores of fat and cannot defend themselves against infections\n\n\n\n\nApart from energy, other nutrients and vitamins are important, and the lack of them is also a source of mortality in kids\n\nThis is another selective pressure to maintain a certain amount of fat\n\n\n\n“Humans have a lot more fat than our closest primate relatives”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nChimps don’t develop obesity, their % fat is in the mid-single digits \nHuman physiology is special in our capacity for fat storage\nStephan doesn’t know the % fat of different ancestral populations; this is an interesting question\n\nDoes a history of starvation select for more obesity-type genes? \n\nJohn Speakman has argued against this idea\n\nApparently obese people do not survive famines better than lean people, which is counterintuitive\nStephan is not sure why this is\n\n\n\n \nThe hedonic aspect of food, and how the brain reacts to modern, highly-rewarding foods [1:03:30]\n\nWe have 5 tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami\n\nWhat is the best way to describe umami? \n\nIt’s a meaty flavor that is present in cooked meat, bone broth, soy sauce\n\nWikipedia describes it as savoriness\n\n\nIt’s distinct from salt\nWhen you look at what hunter gatherers ate (either contemporary or historical), it is radically different from what we eat today\nThere are different hedonic properties today\nWhen the Hadza kill an antelope, they just cut off pieces of meat and cook it in the coals of a fire\n\nThey just cut off charred parts and eat\n\nIt’s half raw on the inside\n\n\nThere are no sauces; they don’t put salt on it\nThey will also eat rotten meat\n\n\nIf a typical person were to try to eat at a Hadza camp for a week, it would be really challenging\n\nProbably the most palatable thing they eat is honey, but they’re not putting it on toast with butter\n\nThey’re drinking the honey and eating the honeycomb\n\n\n\n\nThey also eat a lot of baobab\n\nThis is a very fibrous fruit that has some sweetness but also has some off-flavors; it’s very different from an apple\n\n\nTubers are another major part of their diet; this is their least preferred type of food\n\nThey are so fibrous that they have to spit out a wad of fiber after they’re done chewing it and sucking out the nutrients\n\n\nConsider how our reward circuits adapt to our way of cooking, sauteing onions, adding spices and sauces\nThe Hadza are just taking food out of nature, cooking it, and eating it\nIt’s a radically different diet than we are accustomed to\n\n“Our brains are set up to not be satisfied with ordinary stuff, once we have gotten good stuff”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nMichael Krashes did an interesting study on this in mice\n\nMice normally eat these unrefined food pellets\nThey much prefer calorie-dense, refined, high-fat pellets over these healthier pellets\nHe looked at the activity of their reward circuits and found that once they’ve been exposed to the preferred food, they devalue the less preferred food\n\nThe healthy pellets no longer satisfies them or motivates them in the same way that it did before they were exposed to the highly-preferred food\n\n\n\n\n\nTo put this in context with the typical American diet, people raised in an environment of tasty, calorie-dense, easy-to-eat food would find it difficult to eat as our ancestors did \nHow does calorie density differ from taste?\n\nPeter thinks table sugar is disgusting, he wouldn’t eat it or mix it into water and drink it\n\nIt tastes fine in coffee and tea but not by itself\n\n\nSimilarly, he finds the taste of lard disgusting\n\nEven though he was on a ketogenic diet for 3 years\nHe never developed a taste for putting butter in coffee and things like that\n\n\nBut he LOVES ice cream, “I think ice cream is about one of the most beautiful tastes in the world”\nSo he doesn’t enjoy sugar or butter by itself but combined in ice cream, it’s amazing\n\nIce cream doesn’t have that much more calories than butter\n\n\nAn interesting anecdote related to this‒ when Peter’s daughter turned 6-months old (she’s now 13) they gave her ice cream\n\nHis wife was able to breastfeed so she didn’t have formula\nThey were fastidious about not feeding her junk as typical idiot first parents can be\nBut they gave her a treat for her 6-month birthday\nHe remembers sitting in Del Mar, California and holding an ice cream cone up for her to eat\nHe remembers, “In milliseconds her eyes opened wider than they’ve ever opened, and she couldn’t get into that thing fast enough.”\n\nThis suggests that her brain is responding\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it about taste and energy density that is instantly rewarding? \n\nStephan agrees, ice cream has an almost drug-like effect on his brain; this brings up interesting questions\n\nIf our brains are wired for calories, why are those not very motivating? \n\nThere is an optimal concentration of these nutrients that is not a 100%\n\nSalt is a good example, eating salt straight-up by the spoonful is horrible\nBut at the right concentration, salt really enhances food\n\nThis is true of all the nutrients, including carbohydrate and fat  \n\n\nBliss point is a term used to describe this\n\n\n\nThere is an optimal concentration for enjoyment and, presumably, also for reinforcement; the release of dopamine sets your motivational drive and helps you form habits \n\nIf you removed the sugar from ice cream, it probably wouldn’t taste bad but it wouldn’t be nearly as good\nIf you removed the fat, it also wouldn’t be as good; fat-free ice cream isn’t exactly flying off the shelves\nIt’s the combination of sugar and fat really put it over the top\n\nFoods commonly associated with strong cravings and addictive-like behavior are generally a combination of carbohydrate and fat \n\nUsually there are other flavorings involved\n\nSalt in savory foods like pizza or French fries\nSweet or savory are generally combinations of carbohydrate and fat\n\n\n\n“Modern foods have been crafted to maximally stimulate enjoyment and motivation”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nGenerally these foods are hitting multiple bliss points at the same time\n\nThey’re not a combination you see in nature; you don’t see foods that are as reinforcing\nThe closest thing in nature may be certain type of nuts that have some carbohydrate and fat together\n\n\n\n \nHow we are hard-wired to think about food [1:14:30]\nThinking back to our ancestors, what helped them understand and prioritize calorically-dense food? \n\nPeter would think that 3 things mattered most: i) total calories, ii) protein, and iii) sodium\n\n It can’t be an accident that sodium is the only mineral we can taste \nStephan agrees\n\n\nEnergy for humans primarily comes from carbohydrate and fat\n\nWe get a list: carbohydrate, fat, protein, salt and sometimes umami/ glutamate\nWe are subconsciously wired to like these things\n\n\nHuman cultures have figured out what foods are good over long periods of time\nKey to this is dopamine-mediated reinforcement\n\nOur bodies are setup to respond to certain types of nutrients and create a motivation and learning response that prioritizes and sets the motivation level on seeking these types of foods \n\nPresumably, these are the kinds of nutrients our ancestors would have needed to prioritize to maximize reproductive success (the currency of natural selection) \nModeling has been done on foraging behavior in a wide variety of animals (and humans); it reveals that this behavior generally revolves around maximizing the rate of energy return\n\nPeter thinks the hunting behavior of big cats is a good example of this\nThey will chase an antelope and it’s almost like they have a sensor inside that says, “I’m going to stop chasing now because my energy cost is greater than what I could consume in this kill”\n\n\n\nGut-brain signaling and dopamine mediated reinforcement \n\nOur bodies are wired around energy acquisition, in terms of our motivation and learning on a nonconscious level\n\nIt’s hard-wired\nResearch since 2018 has shown that we have dedicated sensors in the small intestine called neuropod cells (shown as a pink triangle in the figure below)\n\nThey have receptors for specific nutrients and are directly hooked up to the vagal neurons  \n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18421\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f4-guyenet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"673\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f4-guyenet.png 673w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f4-guyenet-300x262.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px\" />\nFigure 4.  The gut detects nutrients and transmits that information to the brain via the vagus nerve.  Image credit: Science 2018\n\nWhen they detect glucose (carbohydrates), amino acids (protein), or fatty acids (fat), they start sending signals up your vagus nerve to your brain stem \nThe signal gets distributes to many parts of the brain, particularly relevant is dopamine release in reward centers (illustrated in the figure below)\nIf the food that you’re eating contains a high concentration of these valuable nutrients (particularly in combination), you’re going to get a higher level of dopamine release\n\n“The more dopamine release you get, the more of a motivation you will develop toward that food”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18422\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f5-guyenet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"519\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f5-guyenet.png 519w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f5-guyenet-300x290.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\" />\nFigure 5. Transmission of nutrients sensed in the gut to the brain.  Image credit: Cell 2018\nConundrum: Why does it seem difficult to eat steak excessively if we’re hard-wired for calorie dense foods?\n\nIt’s high in sodium, fat, and protein and total calories\nThe only thing steak is missing is sugar, fiber, carbohydrates etc. \nStephan asks, “With the potato, is that with or without toppings?” \n\nIt’s so much better with butter, sour cream, salt, and it has to have crispy skin too\n\n\nStephan notes, “When you look at the foods that people cite as the most typically associated with strong cravings and loss of control over eating behavior, meat does not usually come up high on that list” \nThinking about meat, it is about 75% water; so (1) the calorie density is not especially high unless it’s a really fatty piece of meat\nCompare meat to something like a brownie or pizza, which is more calorie dense than steak\n(2) Steak doesn’t have any carbohydrate, so it doesn’t have that fat-carbohydrate combination that is most closely associated with foods that people lose control around\n(3) Steak has a high protein level, and though a strong protein-specific appetite  has been demonstrated in many different species, protein doesn’t work the same as carbohydrate and fat\n\nProtein is something our bodies want to get enough of, but they don’t want to get too much\nThere is a drive to acquire protein, but there’s also a drive to keep it within a certain range and not eat too much\n\n\n\nThis is demonstrated when people go on a high protein diet, their overall calorie intake will drop  \n \nA review of the “Carnivore diet” [1:21:45]\nPeople lose weight on a carnivore diet, is this the motivation for going on this diet?  Why does it result in weight loss? \n\nStephan reviewed a book on this diet, The Carnivore Code \nWe don’t have any good data on the impact of carnivore diet on weight; there are no randomized control trials\nAnecdotally, people lose a lot of weight\nStephan speculates that a carnivore diet has multiple properties that make it an effective weight-loss diet\n\n1 – It has very little carbohydrates\nBeing on the extreme of the fat:carbohydrate ratio in either direction is more slimming than being in the middle\n\n\n\n“The most fattening diets are rich in both carbohydrate and fat”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\n2 – The variety of a carnivore diet is very low\n\nYou can prepare meat in different ways\nYou can eat chicken, fish, beef, whatever but the variety is greatly, greatly reduced \n\n\n3 –  You’re cutting out all the highly-processed, calorie-dense foods \n\nEveryone agrees these foods drive excess intake and increased body fatness, though we could debate why\n\n\n\n\nPeter notes that a carnivore diet may have a role in overcoming some acute illness\n\nOne of the core tenets is that plants are low-grade toxic\nPeter is biased toward thinking that plants are valuable\n\n\n\nWhat is the thesis of a carnivore diet?\n\nEverything is toxic except grass-fed animal foods\nEven tap water is considered not optimal\nThe book spends a lot of time going through the litany of all the potentially harmful compounds in plant foods\n\n“There is a bias toward thinking if it’s in a plant, it’s healthy; and I don’t think that’s true.”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nThere are some plant compounds that are not good for some people\n\nIf you eat a lot of spinach, you can get kidney stones from all the oxalate\nThere are studies suggesting that the glucosinolates in cabbage family plants might contribute to type 2 diabetes\nKidney beans, if you don’t cook them enough, they can be really toxic because of the lectins\n\n\nStephan notes, “The way to think about how healthy a food is is not to say, does it contain toxins? It’s to say what’s the cost-benefit analysis on this food? And most importantly, what are the empirical outcomes that we can see when its impacts on health are directly studied?” \n\nStephan evaluates new ideas people come out with, about a healthy diet \n\nTake lectins for example, Gundry suggests we shouldn’t eat certain plants because they contain lectins\n\nThis is a bottom-up approach, extrapolating empirical effects on health from mechanism\n\n\nStephan thinks its better in a complex field like nutrition to start with the empirical evidence\n\nYou first need a study to suggest that there’s an actual effect on health\nThen you can try to understand the mechanism\n\n\n\nWhat are some biochemical changes that occur in people on a carnivore diet? \n\nThe obvious one is dyslipidemia\nThere’s a shift toward a ketogenic metabolism because of the fact that it’s very low carbohydrate\nOne of the downsides Stephan focused on in the review (that is downplayed by many advocates of the carnivore diet, including Paul Saladino), is the change in LDL cholesterol and LDL particle count\n\nThe crux of his review on Red Pen Reviews is simply that there are a lot of claims made that are not supported by any kind of convincing evidence  \n\nThere is not great evidence here but, a survey of around 2000 carnivore dieters gathered information about their blood lipid values before and after this diet\n\nHe thinks David Ludwig was involved\nThey simply reached out to people on social media groups and administered this survey\nThere was a large increase in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) \nHDL and triglycerides were in an optimal range; see table 4 of the publication\n\n\nJust to repeat what Paul Saladino has said, his LDL cholesterol is 533 mg/dL and his LDL particle count is also through the roof \n\nStepahn doesn’t want to pick on him, just make a point about increased LDL-C\n\n\nNot everyone on a carnivore diet responds like this\n\nHe think’s Shawn Baker’s lipids are fine; he’s another carnivore diet guy\n\n\nStephan recalls a mean increase in LDL of 30 mg/dL in the survey of people on the carnivore diet\nBut a large increase in LDL-C raises red flags in terms of cardiovascular risk over the long run\n\nPeter notes that of all the things that could go wrong, this is one of the most treatable\nIt’s very easy to treat elevated ApoB\nYet, people who go on this diet (or a ketogenic diet) and develop an elevated LDL pattern often avoid treatment\nPeter doesn’t understand why they dig in their heels and say, “Clearly, this is a good thing, and LDL does not cause heart disease” \n\n\n\n“It’s an ideology that has emerged to defend a certain type of dietary pattern.”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nThese kinds of ideas emerge from the low carb community to defend against the idea that there might be some downside to certain types of low carb diets \nIt’s been taken to the extreme in the carnivore community because that’s a potent stimulus for increasing LDL\nPeople don’t want to believe there’s a downside to the thing they’re doing\n\nPeople go on this diet, lose weight, feel better, and have some improvement of X, Y, Z condition\nThey can see all these tangible things improving\nThey don’t want to believe there’s an intangible thing that’s putting them at severe risk\n\nCardiovascular disease is a #1 killer; it’s a huge deal\nEven if it doesn’t kill you, it can do really bad things to you physically and cognitively\nIt’s not a risk you want to be ignoring\n High LDL is treatable and you don’t have to stop the diet \n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s an irrational part of dietary tribal ideology that is holding people back from experiencing their best health”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nPeter notes the same stubborn ideology at the opposite end of the dietary spectrum, where patients go on these incredibly restrictive plant-based diets\n\nIt’s usually some combination of micronutrient deficiency and/or protein deficiency that’s going to be the death of them\nBut they won’t supplement their diet with protein shakes or B vitamins \nThey seem to think it threatens their belief system\nIt’s self-destructive\n\n\n\n \nThe energy balance model, carbohydrate-insulin model, and unifying the theories around adiposity [1:34:15]\n\nPeter recently heard a podcast with Stephan and Kevin Hall\n\n#429: Kevin Hall, PhD & Stephan Guyenet, PhD – Carbohydrate-Insulin Model vs. Energy Balance Model \nHe thought they did a good job explaining the history of these models\n\n\nThe 2 models are the carbohydrate-insulin model (promoted by David Ludwig) and the energy balance model (promoted by Kevin Hall) \nThe most recent incarnation of the carbohydrate-insulin model is a lot more complex than previous one\n\nThe idea that there are things in the diet and in the environment that impact insulin signaling (summarized in the figure below)\nAnd insulin signaling impacts body fatness\n Downstream of the fattening process of insulin signaling on adiposity is the proposal that it leads to elevated calorie intake and possibly a decline in metabolic rate  \nSo it proposes a reversal of the relationship; it proposes a reversal of the relationship between energy balance and body fatness\nBasically, the energy balance phenotype is downstream of that fattening process instead of being upstream \n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18423\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f6-guyenet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"922\" height=\"446\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f6-guyenet.png 922w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f6-guyenet-300x145.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f6-guyenet-768x372.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px\" />\nFigure 6.  The carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity.  Image credit: The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2021\n\nThe energy balance model is upstream of the fattening process\n\nWe have all these things happening in the environment and physiologically in our bodies, and those signals are impinging primarily on the brain (summarized in the figure below)\nEnergy balance is then a result of that brain activity\nAnd this brain activity is feeding into adipose tissue\nSo in that context, body fatness is kind of receiving the excess energy \n Body fat is not really the driver of this process, but when excess energy enters the body, it’s what mops it up \n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18424\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f7-guyenet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"571\" height=\"820\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f7-guyenet.png 571w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f7-guyenet-209x300.png 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" />\nFigure 7.  The energy balance model of obesity.  Image Credit: The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2022\nPeter’s summary of these 2 models \n\nIn the carbohydrate-insulin model, the idea is that the primary cause is the adipose tissue increasing in its fatness\n\nThe adipose tissue wants more energy; this is driven by external factors such as carbohydrates\nAlso in the drive to increase fatty acid deposition into adipose tissue is a reduction in circulating metabolic fuels and this drives an increase in appetite\nIntake of food goes up to accommodate the reduction in circulating metabolic fuels\n\nAll feeding into a drive toward fatness\n\n\n\n\nThe energy balance model is the conventional model; it says the reverse is happening\n\nThe input of fuels into the system leads to an increase in circulating metabolic factors that is now driving energy balance into the fat cell\nStephan points out, “If you look at David Ludwig’s paper, he contrasts the carbohydrate-insulin model against what he calls the energy balance model, which is basically calories in and calories out. None of this is really regulated.” \n\nThe conventional model contends that fat tissue is simply a result of how many calories you happen to eat or how much you decide exercise\nNone of the obesity researchers who study the mechanism of body fat regulation ascribe to the conventional model\n\n\nHowever the energy balance model acknowledges the brain regulation of both body fat and appetite\n\nIt contends that body fatness regulated by the energy intake and expenditure via the brain\n\n\n\n\n\nAre all calories equal?\n\nPeter recalls from the podcast, “One of the things that Kevin pointed out is the energy balance model does not consider all calories identical” (in terms of their impact on body fat)\n\n1 – There may be different thermogenic effects\n2 – There may be different regulatory effects on appetite\n\n\nStephan agrees, this theme is emerging in animal models\n\nYou can change the diet composition and produce animals that will gain fat independent of calorie intake\n\nDavid Ludwig has shown this for carbohydrate quality\nThis has also been shown for dietary fat\n\n\nSo in principle, these types of effects are possible\n\n\nPeter recalls, “Rick Johnson described an experiment like that on my recent podcast with him, which was an isocaloric swap to a very high fructose diet where the animals didn’t gain weight, but they fuel partition differently. They got fatter. This was over a long time…. 9 months” \n\n#194 – How fructose drives metabolic disease | Rick Johnson, M.D.\n\n\nStephan adds this has been shown in a number of contexts in rodents\n\nEnergy expenditure in rodents is more plastic than ours\n\n\n\n \nBody weight set points: a hypothetical comparison of two individuals [1:41:45]\n\n2 siblings are the same height, one weighs 200 lbs and the other weighs 160 lbs\n\nOn the surface they look identical\n\n\nOne of these used to be obese; now they are post-obese\n\nThey lost 40 lbs and kept the weight off \nIt’s 3 years later and his weight doesn’t yo-yo\n\n\nThe other was never obese\n\nAre these 2 people metabolically the same? \n\nStephan thinks probably not\nRudy Leibel has studied people who lost weight out to 1 year (maybe 2)\n\nHe hasn’t seen any sign that their leptin-dependent starvation response goes away\n\n\nThe set point around which the lipostat regulates can change based on dietary and environmental variables \n\nFor example, if you take someone on a typical diet and put them on a low carb diet, you don’t have to tell them to reduce their calorie intake, that will occur spontaneously and they will lose fat and the typical person will end up being comfortable at a lower weight\n\nThey’re not experiencing a starvation response\nYou can see this on other diets as well\n\n\n\n\n\n“There are things we can do to change the set point”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nBut changing the setpoint doesn’t mean a formerly obese person is cured; if they went back to their other diet they will generally go back to their former weight\n\nThe set point can be modified by a different environment\n\nAs long as you maintain that change, you can maintain the effect \nBut if the change goes away, then the effect goes away\n\nWhere is the greatest window of vulnerability for someone who lost weight, going back to these 2 hypothetical individuals? \n\nLet’s take the genetics out of it and pretend they are identical twins living in the same household \nLet’s say they have the genes to allow them to become obese in the right environment\nPerhaps one of them had an injury in high school that kept him from playing sports\n\nHe ended up playing more video games and eating more\n\n\nThe other one was more active, and this explains why now, at age 40, one is 40 lbs overweight and the other is not\n\nAre there windows in a person’s life when they are more susceptible to resetting of a set point, a higher and higher set point? \n\nIt sounds to Peter like the set point never goes down; it’s a monotonic crank\nStephan doesn’t know the answer\nThere is potential for people to gain weight at almost any point in life\nOne thing that is potentially interesting is, there may be an influence of the intrauterine environment \n\nWhat’s going on while you’re developing inside the uterus\nThere is some evidence that women who undergo bariatric surgery for obesity and lose a lot of weight, their children are at a lower risk of developing obesity than women of similar weight who did not have the surgery\n\nThese are 2 women with severe obesity \nThe woman who had bariatric surgery lost a lot of weight before having a child\n\n\n\n\n\nIs weight loss through gastric bypass surgery physiologically the same as losing weight from diet and lifestyle changes? \n\nPeter doesn’t think so\nGastric bypass is unique where by as long as the person doesn’t take in liquid calories, the weight loss is quite durable\n\nLiquid calories can completely disrupt the feedback mechanisms, similar to a GLP-1 agonist \nAnecdotally, Peter has seen patients who take semaglutide who don’t lose weight\n\n\n\nThe way you can cheat semaglutide is to drink a massive amounts of calories\n\nSo drinking a lot of alcohol, juices, or things like that \n\n \nTakeaways for people who want to lose weight and keep it off [1:48:30]\nFor people in the obese category\n\nFor people with a BMI of 30 or 35, it’s worthwhile to consider medical treatment\nSomething like semaglutide; it’s a very safe drug\n\nIt causes something on the order of 18% weight loss\nThis is better than the typical effect of diet and lifestyle strategies but you have to keep taking the drug \n\n\nSee an obesity specialist\n\n“The tools that we have now are just way better than what they used to be”‒ Stephan Guyenet\nFor people who just want to lose a few pounds \n\n Your appetite and your body fatness are very much regulated by your brain \n\nThis is based on inputs your brain is receiving; a lot of this is nonconscious\n\n\nTry to give the nonconscious brain signals to regulate things in a more slimming direction\nHe doesn’t think it is sustainable or effective for most people to simply rely on willpower all the time\nHere are some ways to control these signals to your brain:\n\n1 – Control your food environment and the sensory cues your brain is exposed to\n\nHow tempting is it to grab and eat food in your vicinity? \nLower the barriers to eating healthy, prep healthy snacks and have them nearby\n\n\n2 – There’s a wide variation in the number of calories it takes to feel satisfied at a meal and this depends on what foods you are eating\n\nIt’s intuitive to eat until you feel satisfied and then stop eating\nThe satiety point can be reached with vastly different numbers of calories\n\n\n\n\n\nIs satiety a function of gastric distention? \n\nThis is important, but the system is complex; the brain is receiving a lot of signals \n\nSignals from the small intestine about what the nutrient composition is\nOral sensory detection of food properties \nYour brain knows based on the sensory properties what the nutritional composition of the food is based on prior experience \nStomach distention is a biggie, and this relates to calorie density\nIf you have a food that has more volume per calories, it fills up your stomach more and sends signals to oppose further food intake\n Protein is more satiating per calorie\nPalatability, the better something tastes the less it fills you up per calorie\n\n\n\nStephan is not sure how to disentangle palatability from calorie density but they’re both strongly correlated with lower satiety \n\nPeter asks about the drive to simply finish what’s on your plate whereas if they finished 10 bites earlier, they would have been happy\nStephan agrees, this is a plausible factor\nThe problem is, research from Biran Wansink was so bad, much of it was retracted\n\nThe refilling soup bowls was one of his classic experiments\n\n\n\n \nEvidence that favors the energy balance model of weight gain [1:56:00]\nComparing the 2 models\n\nOne of the arguments in favor of the carbohydrate-insulin model is other examples of growth that are regulated from the hormones, out to the intake of energy\nPeter thinks about watching his kids grow in height\n\nHis youngest is not yet 5, he eats more than the other 2 combined; and he’s growing fast\nMost would agree he’s not growing because of how much he’s eating\nHe’s eating that much because of how much he’s growing\nHe’s responding to growth hormone and all these other things\n\n\n\nThe central thrust of the carbohydrate-insulin model is, increased insulin signaling is driving an increase in food intake \n\nThis can be initiated by sleep disturbances that increase (or decrease) insulin signaling, or foods that stimulate insulin\n\nExperimentally, what is different about these models? \n\nBoth Peter and Stephan agree, data suggests the energy balance model is easier to explain\n The models are not mutually exclusive \nIf you understand the mechanism of obesity, then it should be easier to address\nMost obesity drugs (weight loss drugs) were discovered in haphazard ways\n\nDinitrophenol was a high explosive used in World War I, and somebody figured out if you take it, it makes you lose weight\n\nIt does so by increasing your energy expenditure\nSo some people managed to cook themselves literally from the inside out\n\n\nMany of the other drugs are repurposed psychiatric drugs that just happen to cause weight loss\n\n\nRybelsus (Semaglutide) is a drug developed to treat obesity based on its mechanism of action, from the bottom up\n\nIt’s safe and effective\n\n\nWe’re in a new era where weight loss drugs are being designed based on mechanism and an understanding of biological regulation\n Cardiovascular medicine is an example of this more refined era of drug development\n\n Incredible insights have been coming out of genetics studies such as PCSK9 inhibitors\n\nThis is an example where we first understood the biology, then we came out with a therapy\nAnd it works awesome\n\n\n\n\nThis is the era we’re are getting into now with obesity\n\n“It actually is really important to understand the mechanism”‒ Stephan Guyenet\nThe success of Semaglutide argues against the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity \n\nPeter predicts that these models will have more and more in common as time goes on\nOne of the arguments against the carbohydrate-insulin model is provided by semaglutide\n\nThis drug raises insulin in the short run\nPatients on this drug lose a ton of weight and their insulin levels go up slightly\n\nThis tends to resolve over a long period\nBut for at least 3 months, they have elevated insulin\n\n\nWe know the drug is increasing insulin sensitivity\n\nSo patients on the drug are getting a double effect\n\n\nThis is hard to reconcile with a model that claims insulin must go down for weight/ fat to go down\n\n\nStephan replies, “I think that model is just not even plausible at this point. If you want to say, is it a factor? I think that’s still in play, but to say, this is the determinant, I just don’t even think that’s plausible at this point.” \nSemaglutide was identified based on its ability to increase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion\n\nThat is what GLP-1 does\nIt’s an incretin hormone and this is why it was used in type 2 diabetes management\nIt gives people more insulin around meals when they really need it\n\nJust injecting insulin is a crude way to manage blood glucose; it’s not time specific\nGLP-1 gave it that much needed time specificity \nGLP-1 also had some other benefits in reducing food intake and body weight\nThe figure below summarizes the effects of GLP-1 which would presumably extend to GLP-1 receptor agonists such as Semaglutide \n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18425\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f8-guyenet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"743\" height=\"597\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f8-guyenet.png 743w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f8-guyenet-300x241.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\" />\nFigure 8.  Functions of GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptor agonists such as Semaglutide.  Image credit: Lthoms11 on Wikipedia\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) on BMI point largely to genes involved in the brain \nGWAS on body fat distribution (controlling for BMI and looking at the distribution of fat on the body) point to a insulin signal \n\nThis gives some support to the carbohydrate-insulin model\n\n\n\nPeter’s takeaway‒ the total amount of body fat seems more related to energy intake; it’s regulated more on the intake side of the equation and somewhat by the brain \n\nThe carbohydrate insulin model is all about this idea of energy partitioning; there could be some of that flying under the radar of BMI\n\nThis adds a layer of nuance\nStephan doesn’t think the door is closed on it\n\n\nThis is showing up in body fat distribution\nDavid Ludwig is publishing studies suggesting there could be correlations between baseline insulin secretion and what proportion of weight loss is lost as fat versus a lean tissue \n\nPublished in the Journal of Nutrition in 2022, Stimulated Insulin Secretion Predicts Changes in Body Composition Following Weight Loss in Adults with High BMI\n\n\nStephan thinks there could be some energy partitioning effect but he doesn’t think the carbohydrate-insulin model explains obesity, because obesity is not just energy partitioning\n\nYou have a bigger body, you’re eating more energy, you’re burning more energy\nYou have more lean mass, more fat\nThat phenotype is not explained by energy partitioning\nBut there could be some subtle energy partitioning phenotype that is also operating \n\n\n\n \nThe synergistic effect of fat and carbohydrates and observations that a low-fat diet or a low-carb diet can cause weight loss [2:04:30]\nPeter recalls, “You said something earlier about the more you restrict carbohydrate or the more you restrict fat, typically the more weight you’re going to lose. The sweet spot, if you want to gain weight, is to have lots of both of them. How much of that do you think comes down to the hedonic component of how good ice cream tastes? The ubiquity of food choices? Or do you think there’s something very unique physiologically going on? ”\n\nFor example, people on the potato diet (where all they eat is potatoes), lose weight like crazy\nThis has been shown in animal models\n\nThe advantage here is the ability to have really tight control on the diet for a large proportion of the animal’s lifespan\n\n\nJohn Speakman published a study of around 29 different diets and 5 different strains of mice\n\nPublished in Cell Metabolism in 2018, Dietary Fat, but Not Protein or Carbohydrate, Regulates Energy Intake and Causes Adiposity in Mice\nTheir predictions and findings are summarized in the figure below\nThey systematically varied the carbohydrate to fat ratio in the diet\nThey asked, “How does that interact with body fatness?” \n\n\n\nThey found mice got fatter with the more fat they ate, up to a point at which they began to lose weight \n\n1 – If you start with animals that are on a low fat/ high carbohydrate diet, and you start replacing that carb with fat, they get fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter until you hit about 60%\n2 – But then as they kept increasing the fat and decreasing the carbohydrate, the mice would get slimmer again\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18426\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f9-guyenet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"732\" height=\"734\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f9-guyenet.png 732w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f9-guyenet-300x300.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f9-guyenet-150x150.png 150w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f9-guyenet-500x500.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" />\nFigure 9.  Summary of results from studying 29 diets in 5 strains of mice.  Image credit: Cell Metabolism 2018\n\nThere are studies published showing rodents lose weight on a ketogenic diet, just like humans do\n\nStephan’s takeaway: having a diet in the middle is where the problem is \n\nPeter notes this is ironic, because that’s where the standard American diet is, in the middle\n\nIt’s easy to eat the wrong combination of fat and carbohydrate\n\n\nStephan adds, “If you look anywhere in the world where people are rich enough and industrialized enough to eat whatever they want, that’s generally what you’re going to see. At least after a couple decades of cultural adaptation, you’re going to see pretty equal proportions of fat and carbohydrate.”\nThere are some hypotheses to explain why this is (though presently we don’t really know)\n\nThis is primarily an empirical observation that we’re trying to explain\n1 – There is a physiological effect of not eating much carbohydrate\n\nYour body has to work a little bit harder to synthesize glucose; this is an increased metabolic demand\n\n\n2 – There is also a physiological effect of eating a low fat diet \n\nYou’re slightly increasing metabolic demand\nYou’re going to synthesize more fatty acids\n\n\nBut Stephan doesn’t think these are great explanations as these metabolic effects are very small\n\n\n\nQuestions about Speakman’s studies \n\n Were the mice allowed to eat ad libitum? \n Were they eating significantly less at the extremes in terms of total energy intake? \n Were the diets controlled for protein? \nStephan thinks the answer is yes\nSometimes there was not a perfectly tight correlation between energy intake and fat gain\nThere is the physiology of increased metabolic cost of living the extremes\nThere is also the neurobiology of food intake\n\nStephan’s take away: I think the most satisfying explanation we have right now is that foods that are more appealing to eat (and more motivating) have both carbohydrate and fat \n\nHe’s not saying he has evidence this is the explanation, but this is the only thing he can think of that explains it\nWhen people go on a very low fat or a very low carb diet, their energy intake declines by hundreds of calories a day\n\nThis happens automatically, right away\n\n\n His thought is that food in these diets is less rewarding so we eat less of it \nPeter notes, “It’s not very difficult to take your carbohydrate intake down to 5-7%, a ketogenic diet will do that. It’s a pretty easy diet to adhere to, especially today.”\nHe doesn’t know now how one would go about getting only 5% of their calories from fat; this seems harder\n\nStephan agrees\n\n\nIn studies of low fat diets, the lowest fat content was in the 10% fat range\n\nEven starch foods like whole wheat and corn have a fair amount of fat in them; not far off from 10%\n\n\nYou would have to work hard to lower your fat intake to 15% and Peter is not convinced there are great health benefits to this\n\n \nRed Pen Reviews [2:11:00]\n\nRed Pen Reviews is a 501c3 nonprofit that publishes the most informative, consistent and unbiased reviews of popular nutrition books available\n\nDeveloped by Stephan with the help of other academics; inspired by the nutrition scientist Seth Yoder \n\n\n\nWhat makes this website unique is the semi-quantitative review method they developed and apply to each book \n\nThey explain their review method on the website\n\nThis yields a numerical score for scientific accuracy, reference accuracy, and helpfulness\nThis allows them to apply the same rigorous method to all books so the reader can compare apples to apples between different books\n\n\nPeter notes, “This is a pretty labor intensive process. So how many do you bang out in a year?” \nThey spend 40-100 hours per book\nThey’ve been operating since 2019 and have 14 reviews\n\nTheir pace was slow last year due to COVID-related challenges\nThey’re on target to publish 6-8 reviews this year\n\n\nThey have a total of 8 reviewers, each completes on average 1 review a year\n\nBut it turns out that some people do the majority of the reviews\n\n\nStephan points out, “We are trying to maximize our impact on public health knowledge and public health. So we really try to pick the books that are most impactful right now.”\nThey aim to give people information on things they are already interested in by looking for books that are:\n\nSelling the most\nHave the most social media engagement\nAre from influential authors\n\n\nThe most recent book they reviewed was The Ultimate Volume Metrics Diet by Barbara Rolls\nBefore that was The Carnivore Code by Paul Saladino; Stephan was the primary reviewer for this one (link to the review)\n\nThey have a primary reviewer and a peer reviewer\n\n\nBefore that was Eat, Drink, And Be Healthy by Walter Willett (link to the review)\nBefore that Eat Fat, Get Thin by Mark Hyman (link to the review)\n\nYou’ve been doing this for three years now, has anything surprised you so far? \n\n Stephan remarks, “One of the things that has really come into focus through the course of this process is that credentials are not a reliable correlate of information quality” \n\nNot to pick on anyone, to give an example‒ David Perlmutter is a MD and a board certified neurologist, yet his book Grain Brain got the lowest scientific accuracy score of any book they reviewed (link to the review)\nHe’s seen this in many cases\nCredentials are not completely meaningless, but once you get into people who are highly credentialed, their work is variable\n\nSome of their books do really well and some do really poorly\n\n\n\n\n\n“I think most people who are educated in this sphere know that there’s a lot of low quality information”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nLike in science, there’s a replicability crisis\n\nScientists are not infallible\nThere’s problems like this, even in this peer reviewed literature\n\n\nBut once you get outside of this sphere where there’s accountability and you’re in the public sphere where there’s very little accountability, it’s a free for all\n\nMany people who are very well credentialed share information that is very low quality\nMost people have very little ability to detect it\nStephan admits, “Even somebody like me, who I consider myself knowledgeable, at least in some areas I can get taken in too. I might read a book and it seems compelling.”\n\n\n The Carnivore Code did worse than he expected\n\nAs he was reading it he thought it made sense, it was interesting, it brought up points he wanted to look into\nBut when he started checking the citations and searching the scientific literature he realized the book did not put forth the best interpretation that an unbiased person would come to when looking at this body of evidence \n\n\n\nMost of his surprises were realizing the quality of popular nutrition books was worse than he thought \n\nPeter is in the process of trying to finish his book; one of the things that is so daunting is the fact-checking process\n\nHe could never rely on his publisher for this, it’s too technical \nHe has analysts who fact check, but they have to be analysts who did not help with the research for the book because you’ve got to get fresh eyes on it\nHe just knows there’s going to be something they get wrong, incorrectly cite, or misinterpret\n\n\nThere’s something daunting  knowing that the book won’t hit the shelves until 8 months after the last edits\n\nSomething is going to change in those 8 months, let alone 2 years\n\n\nStephan agrees, every book is going to have mistakes\nThe process Peter describes is far more rigorous than most books being published in this sphere\nPublishers do not impose a filter on the contents of these books\n\nThey do not view it as their job to police the claims of authors\nIf somebody comes in with an MD, they’re viewed as the expert\n\n\nFor Stephan’s book (The Hungry Brain), he sent chapters out to experts in the field and had them look at it\n\nThis doesn’t’ mean his book won’t have mistakes\nHe’s been cataloging mistakes on his website\n\n\nPeter agrees, mistakes are inevitable\n\nThe best approach is to collectively figure out what they are and create a repository of updates\n\n\nStephan thinks this is the best attitude, a truth-seeking attitude\n\nYou’re not presenting yourself as someone who has to be right to be rational\n\n\n\n“You’re presenting yourself as someone who’s trying to get towards the truth and your audience can help you and help all together to get closer to the truth”‒ Stephan Guyenet\n\nThe method Stephan developed for Red Pen Reviews is available on their website for authors to see\n\nThey have criteria for healthfulness\nThey have criteria for scientific accuracy that can’t be gamed\n\n\nHe admits, “Part of the reason why we do that is because we’re trying to help authors write better books”\nIf you write a book that you think would score well, that going to be a good book from an evidence standpoint\nStephan would have loved to have these criteria available when he was writing his book\n\nIt’s a great resource for writing with higher quality evidence\n\n\nHe likes to view his organization as not just finger wagging at people who makes mistakes, but also providing a resource to improve information quality\nThe reviews are freely available to anyone\nThey love donations, but access to their resources do not depend on that\n\nPeter’s takeaway:  \n\nIt is kind of amazing how much we still don’t know about something that is so ubiquitous and so important\n\n\nHe gets the sense we’re converging\n\n\nHe thinks these good faith debates that exist between people like Stephan, Kevin, David Ludwig\n\n\nThey’re really good for the field because it’s forcing people to be sharper in their thinking\n\n\nUltimately it’s getting us closer to theories that are aligning better with experimental evidence\n\n\nPeter knows his thinking on this has changed quite a bit and he now finds the balance of the evidence to be more on the energy balance side of the equation \n\n\nHe enjoys trying to understand both sides of this\n\nIt’s very complicated, suggesting that there’s more overlap in the theories than we probably appreciate\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialEpisode of The Drive that discussed the “obesity paradox”: #197 – The science of obesity & how to improve nutritional epidemiology | David Allison, Ph.D. | Host Peter Attia, The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (February 28, 2022) | [16:00]\nMaximum attained weight method of correlating BMI with mortality risk: Using maximum weight to redefine body mass index categories in studies of the mortality risks of obesity | Population Health Metrics (A Stokes 2014) | [19:30]\nEpisode of The Drive  with Rudy Leibel: #33 – Rudy Leibel, M.D.: Finding the obesity gene and discovering leptin | Host Peter Attia, The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (December 17, 2018) | [30:15]\nBook by Herman Pontzer: Burn: New Research Blows the Lid Off How We Really Burn Calories, Lose Weight, and Stay Healthy by Herman Pontzer (March 2021) | [32:00, 59:00]\nStephan’s book The Hungry Brain: The Hungry Brain: Outsmarting the Instincts That Make Us Overeat by Stephan J.
