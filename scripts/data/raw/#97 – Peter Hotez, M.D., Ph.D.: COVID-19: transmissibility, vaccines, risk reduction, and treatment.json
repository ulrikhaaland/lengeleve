  "title": "#97 – Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.: COVID-19: transmissibility, vaccines, risk reduction, and treatment",
  "content": "In this episode, Dr. Peter Hotez M.D., Ph.D., Dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine Baylor College of Medicine, shares his expertise on viral disease and how it applies specifically to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus that causes it (SARS-CoV-2). Dr. Hotez informs us about the current state of disease progression, which has many unknowns, but has thus far been greatly determined by the delayed response time and lack of testing. Moreover, we discuss what we can do on a country, state, community, and individual level in order to collectively slow transmission of the disease. He shares with us a potential hope in convalescent plasma therapy and underscores the need for US federal involvement – particularly in the creation of a specialty task force to address areas of concern and unknowns. \nDisclaimer: This is information accurate as of March 13, 2020, when it was recorded.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#97 - Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.: COVID-19: transmissibility, vaccines, risk reduction, and treatment\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#97 - Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.: COVID-19: transmissibility, vaccines, risk reduction, and treatment\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#97 - Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.: COVID-19: transmissibility, vaccines, risk reduction, and treatment\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nThe disease and the virus: transmissibility and lethality [04:30];\nDisease transmission: US playing catch-up [12:00];\nConvalescent plasma coronavirus therapy [16:00];\nRemdesivir drug treatment and vaccination challenges [19:45];\nDisease mechanism and reported pathology [27:45];\nMost concerning geographic regions in the US [39:00];\nRisk reduction [46:30];

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

Comparison of Guangzhou and Wuhan intervention impact. Image credit: (Marc Lipsitch)\n\nGuangzhou intervened much earlier in epidemic and had a much smaller peak in bed demand\n\nEarly intervention spares the health system from intense stress (e.g., Philadelphia vs. St. Louis)\n\n\nEarly intervention means action is taken prior to the number ramp (e.g., citing Guangzhou that intervened when they had 7 cases and 0 deaths vs. Wuhan that had 495 confirmed cases, 23 dead)\n\nIn the US, there is concern about hospital inundation \n\nUS will not intervene as did Guangzhou \nAlready too late in response time\nThe U.S. first case was likely at the beginning of February and the spread of virus went unaddressed for more than a month\n\nIn order to slow the disease spread, social distancing is important\n\nThe U.S. will now start to test and we will see in the next 1-2 weeks which communities have significant levels of transmission\nWe could potentially intervene in those places and shift the growth curve \n\n“We have lost the opportunity to avoid an epidemic” —Peter Hotez M.D., Ph.D.\nConvalescent plasma coronavirus therapy [16:00]\nIn an interview with Alisyn Camerota on CNN … Peter referenced how he emphasized that this is not the time to assign fault \nQuote TK “Now is not the time to assign fault … we can do that later. Right now we have to focus on the task at hand” – Peter Hotez M.D., Ph.D.\n\nOne of the first order of action is to find an intervention while vaccine and antiviral drug intervention are pursued \nColleague Arturo Casadevall is pushing the idea for a low-cost antibody therapy intervention \nThe strategy takes antibodies from individuals that have been infected and have since recovered\nCasadevall and his colleagues have already started testing this therapy for use\nOne report summarizes the effectiveness of convalescent plasma as a potential therapy for COVID-19, citing historical situation learnings (e.g., SARS-CoV-1, The 1918 Spanish Flu)\n\nThe logistics of this solution are not as straightforward…Government intervention is necessary\n\nMethod requires apheresis, blood banks, centrifuge\nWould require Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER FDA) guidance\nArturo thinks putting together a federal task force would be necessary\n\nThe solution is scalable …\n\n300mL for someone seriously ill (so 1 donor to 1 recipient) \nAs a prophylaxis treatment, 5mL for someone equates to ~ one donor for dozens of individuals \n\nRemdesivir drug treatment and vaccination challenges [19:45]\n\nRemdesivir has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses\nGilead’s antiviral drug Remdesivir stands out for potential to treat coronavirus. The drug has rapidly moved to phase 3 studies, with data expected by April\nAntiviral medication development and application will move a lot faster than vaccines\n\nTechnical challenges associated with vaccine developments\n\nVaccines are the highest bar there is in terms of testing because it involves immunizing healthy individuals \nMakes it difficult to compress timelines \nDevelopment and trial process can last 2-3 years \n\n\nPhase 1 for safety \nPhase 2 expanded to demonstrate safety and some efficacy \nPhase 3 for safety and efficacy in natural disease conditions \n\n\nProcess should not be rushed\nWith respect to Coronavirus vaccines – there is a risk of immune enhancement –  where vaccine could actually make things worse (seen in lab animals)\nSimilar to 1960’s Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine – inactivated vaccine in which vaccine recipients did worse, with more hospitalizations \n\nVaccination promise with spike protein receptors\n\nOne study identified  a target for vaccine and therapeutic development\nFrom which an NIH grant was submitted based on the identification of a highly promising lead candidate vaccine antigen, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12293\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-3.png 512w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-3-300x289.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" />\nFigure 6.

The only comfort I take in that is if current models for infection rate are anything like the models I have worked with: a small change in assumption can result in 2-3 logarithmic reduction in deaths…” —Peter Hotez M.D., Ph.D.\nRisk Reduction [46:30]\n\nWe still have some say in our response to this:\n\nat the federal, local, state and personal level \nSelf isolating and quarantining when necessary (any signs or symptoms) \n\n\n\nThe plea for federal guidance and specialty task forces \n\nWe need specialists to come together as a task force on a given issue (e.g., antibody-based technology, nursing home care structures, mental health experts, metabolic disease teams) – all to try and understand what is going on\nOlder individuals in clusters are high risk but the challenge is to weight risk vs socialization important \n\nWant to protect and isolate individuals \nSocialization and seeing other is very (psychologically important) \n\n\n\n“This is where I say I am a vaccine scientist but pretty good at understanding infectious disease epidemiology. But there is a point where decisions become so tricky that I start to exceed where I feel comfortable.” —Peter Hotez M.D., Ph.D.\nIn the coming weeks…\n\nPeter will be focusing on incidence and prevalence data in the weeks to come\nAs we increase testing, we will be able to observe which new communities become infected \nVaccine trials have begun in Washington which is a positive but we will also see immune enhancement, if there is any, in volunteer population \nMake sure to take a retrospective look to what was learned the previous week \nWe have to continually reevaluate \n\n“This is where we are right now and this virus is racing so quickly […] new pathogens in general set you [an infrastrucutre] to look stupid […] but this one especially because it is so fast moving and transmissible” —Peter Hotez M.D., Ph.D.\n§"
