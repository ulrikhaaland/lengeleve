  "content": "See more content from Rick Johnson, M.D.:\n\n\n\n(January 6, 2020) Metabolic Effects of Fructose with Rick Johnson, M.D. | Part I\n(February 6, 2022) How Fructose Drives Metabolic Disease with Rick Johnson, M.D. | Part II\n\n\n\n\nRick Johnson, Professor of Nephrology at the University of Colorado and a previous guest on The Drive, returns for a follow-up about unique features of fructose metabolism, and how this system that aided the survival of human ancestors has become potentially hazardous based on our culture’s dietary norms. In this episode, Rick explains how the body can generate fructose from glucose and how circulating glucose and salt levels can activate this conversion. He discusses the decline in metabolic flexibility associated with aging, as well as how factors such as sugar intake or menopause-associated hormone changes can alter responses to sugar across a lifetime. In addition, Rick lays out strategies for combating the development of metabolic illness using dietary changes and pharmaceutical therapies, and he discusses the impact of fructose metabolism and uric acid on kidney function and blood pressure. He concludes with a discussion of vasopressin, a hormone that facilitates fructose’s effects on weight gain and insulin resistance.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n<iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V02z9mqTWzg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#194 -

As ADP  levels rise, ATP and AMP are produced.  Image Credit: Keeping the home fires burning: AMP-activated protein kinase\nWhy high fructose corn syrup is particularly bad\n\nFructose concentration relates to not just the amount of fructose, but how rapidly it’s absorbed\n\nLiquid fructose (like a soft drink) consumed on an empty stomach, can get absorbed very quickly and even more quickly when it is high fructose corn syrup\nThere’s some debate on this, but in high fructose corn syrup, the fructose and glucose are already separated so that it may be absorbed differently than sucrose where it’s glucose and fructose bound together, but they are broken and they have to be degraded to the individual fructose and glucose in the gut before they’re absorbed\nThe figure below shows the relationship between structure of glucose, fructose, and sucrose\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16737\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f3-rickjohnson2-1024x338.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f3-rickjohnson2-1024x338.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f3-rickjohnson2-300x99.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f3-rickjohnson2-768x253.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f3-rickjohnson2-1536x507.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f3-rickjohnson2-2048x676.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 3. Sucrose is 1 glucose bound to 1 fructose.  Image credit: Wikimedia Commons\n\nDrinking liquid fructose leads to very fast absorption; the concentration will be higher when it reaches the liver\nThe liver is one of the key sites of fructose metabolism that drives this whole process\nWhen fructose gets to the liver, fructokinase phosphorylates it, and the ATP levels acutely fall\n\nCellular response to low ATP levels\n\nThe low ATP state is maintained primarily by a drop in intracellular phosphate that accompanies this and that activates this enzyme system that removes the breakdown of ATP products\n\nThese 2 reactions occur together (shown in the Figure 1)\n\nATP + H2O → ADP + Pi \nFructose → Fructose-1-Phosphate\n\n\nWith ADP and Pi removed, ATP cannot be regenerated easily (see Figure 2)\nNormally AMP and ADP get reformed to make more ATP\n\n2 ADP → ATP + AMP\nThey’re really important to make the ATP\n\n\nThe ATP levels fall\nThere’s the accumulation of ADP and AMP (adenosine monophosphate, AMP,  is one of the key ones) and then AMP is swept away\nIf the AMP is removed, then it’s hard to replenish the ATP because you’ve removed a key building block for ATP\n\nAMP is removed by an enzyme called AMP deaminase, which turns out to be a very, very important enzyme in this pathway\n\n\n\n\nAMP deaminase breaks down the AMP stepwise until it produces uric acid, which is the end product of purine metabolism\nThe adenine of ATP is a purine, and it eventually gets broken down to uric acid\n Uric acid inside the cell actually causes oxidative stress to the mitochondria\n\nThe mitochondria are also really important in ATP production\n\n\nThe oxidative stress affects the mitochondria in several ways\n\n1) It inhibits an enzyme called aconitase, which is involved in the Krebs cycle and basically leads to citrate accumulation in the stimulation of fat production\n2) It also blocks an enzyme called Enoyl-CoA hydratase\n\nThis enzyme is involved in beta fatty acid oxidation (step #2); blocking this blocks the burning of fatty acids\n\n\nUltimately what happens is, it reduces the production of ATP \n\nBy blocking the Krebs cycle (this shunts these components to make fat) \nAnd by blocking the burning of fat\nSee the review from 2018, Fructose and sugar: A major mediator of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\n\n\n\n\nIn all, fructose metabolism stimulates fat storage\nUric acid also inhibits AMP kinase (AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase); this blocks energy production\n\n“It’s a brilliant system to set the energy levels down in a cell, and it mimics the condition of starvation.” – Rick Johnson\n\nReducing the energy in the cell triggers an alarm signal; it’s a survival pathway\n\nThis leads to a survival response, makes the animal get hungry, thirsty, forage for food, try to store fat, try to store glycogen\n\n\n\n \nA primer on fructose metabolism and uric acid [10:30]\n\nFructose can be metabolized like glucose through some of the glucose enzymes but it prefers to be metabolized by fructokinase\n\nFructose has a higher affinity for fructokinase than glucose enzymes\n\n\n\nTissues that express fructokinase\n\nNormally fructokinase is present in modest amounts in the gut\nFructokinase is also present in the liver, brain, islets of the pancreas, some in white fat, and a fair amount in the kidney\n\nThe islet of the pancreas is very important because that’s where insulin and glucagon are produced\n\n\n\nFructokinase expression is upregulated\n\nExpression of fructokinase can be turned on whenever there is injury\n\nFor example, it can be induced in the heart following a heart attack\nIt can be produced in the kidney further or be activated further to have kidney failure, following damage to the kidney from a COVID infection \n\n\nInduced expression is probably trying to provide some “survival mechanisms” in these sites\n\nBut what happens is, it tends to be over activated and end up causing worse injury rather than protection from injury\n\n\nThe main sites of fructokinase expression are the liver, the brain, the islets, the kidney, and the intestine\n\nFructokinase action in the liver causes energy depletion\n\nFructokinase seems to cause energy depletion in all those sites except the intestine\nWork done by Dr. Joshua Rabinowitz from Princeton has shown that the fructokinase in the gut, when there’s just small amounts of fructose, it actually tends to not cause the energy depletion and to actually convert the fructose to glucose\n\nFructose can be converted to glucose and glucose can be converted to fructose\nAt high concentrations of fructose, energy depletion probably occurs\n\n\n\n“The intestine tends to be a shield that at low concentrations just helps remove the fructose without it being a problem” – Rick Johnson\n\nThe action of fructokinase in the intestine is one reason why fruits and vegetables don’t cause energy depletion\n\nFruits have 4 grams of fructose\nVegetables have small amounts of fructose, 2-5 grams\nIntestinal fructokinase seems to inactivate small amounts of fructose\nPublished in Cell Metabolism in 2018, The Small Intestine Converts Dietary Fructose into Glucose and Organic Acids\n\n\nIf a large amount of fructose is consumed, it gets through the intestine\n\nIt probably causes ATP injury to the intestine\nRick has done some studies to show it causes gut leak\n\nDiscussed in this review from 2018, Fructose and sugar: A major mediator of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\nIt may be responsible for  anaphylaxis to certain foods (food allergies)\n\n\n\n\nMost fructose is metabolized in the liver and the liver seems to be the primary place that drives the metabolic syndrome and obesity and diabetes\n\nStudy comparing fructokinase action in the intestine versus liver, published in Cell Metabolism in 2020, Deletion of Fructokinase in the Liver or in the Intestine Reveals Differential Effects on Sugar-Induced Metabolic Dysfunction\nIf he knocks out fructokinase just in the liver, he can protect animals from obesity and diabetes and high blood pressure\n\n\nThe liver is the king when it comes to metabolic syndrome\nThe kidney’s actually important for kidney disease\nThe brain is really important for diseases like Alzheimer’s and so forth; he’ll come back to his\n\n“Fructose turns out to have been meant to be this wonderful system for survival, but in our culture with the amount of sugar in foods that we are eating (that either provide sugar or can be turned into fructose), this pathway has become hazardous” – Rick Johnson\n\nPeter goes back to step #1, fructose is eaten, it goes through the stomach, into the duodenum and into the proximal part of what’s called the jejunum\n\nEpithelial cells line the gut\n\n\nLow doses of fructose (from eating a piece of fruit or some vegetables) can be absorbed in the gut without creating an ATP deficit \nHigher concentrations of fructose cause a problem; they get through the gut without being metabolized\n\nFructose enters the portal system\nThe reason it preferentially makes its way to the liver is due to the venous system that drains the gut\n\nWhere the superior mesenteric vein and inferior mesenteric vein join the splenic vein, these things become the portal vein and that becomes an inflowing conduit to the liver\n\n\n\n\nThe liver has 2 incoming blood supplies:\n\n1) The arterial supply, which supplies oxygen\n2) The venous supply, which supplies nutrients on first pass from the gut\nThis is why the liver plays such an important role in metabolism\n\n\nFructose that gets through the gut, goes to the liver where it is phosphorylated by fructokinase\n\nBy definition, this is a high fructose state because the gut’s capacity to metabolize fructose has been exceeded\nNow there is unlimited conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate\n\nThe reaction catalyzed by fructokinase: fructose + ATP → fructose-1-phosphate + ADP + Pi\nThe cell is generating lots of ADP\nThis reaction requires ATP\n\n\n\n\nATP has 3 phosphate groups (see the image below)\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16738\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f4-rickjohnson2-1024x823.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"823\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f4-rickjohnson2-1024x823.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f4-rickjohnson2-300x241.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f4-rickjohnson2-768x617.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f4-rickjohnson2.png 1446w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 4.

there is no signal that the cell has enough energy\n\nThe opposite occurs, as more fructose is eaten, more is wanted\nIt turns off the ability to oxidize fat and turns on the ability to store fat and make more fat from fructose metabolism\nThis is an amazing adaptation\n\n\nRick notes this is a fundamental mechanism developed in nature; it’s a process so key for survival that all animals use it\n\nDiscussed further in Fructose metabolism as a common evolutionary pathway of survival associated with climate change, food shortage and droughts, published in the Journal of Internal Medicine in 2020\nThe figure below summarizes how fructose metabolism provides survival functions but in excess contributes to disease\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16740\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f6-rickjohnson2-1024x590.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f6-rickjohnson2-1024x590.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f6-rickjohnson2-300x173.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f6-rickjohnson2-768x442.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f6-rickjohnson2-1536x885.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f6-rickjohnson2-2048x1179.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 6.  Role of fructose metabolism in survival and disease.  Image credit: Journal of Internal Medicine 2020\n \nEndogenous fructose production, the polyol pathway, and the effect of non-fructose sugars [22:00]\n\nOne of the breakthroughs was the discovery that it’s not just the fructose we eat, but that the body can make fructose\n\nAnd when the body makes enough fructose, it can activate this pathway\n\n\nWhen he first began studying this he thought the solution would be a low fructose diet\n\nAnd maybe this is how low carb diets work, because they are also low in fructose\nHe wrote the book, The Sugar Fix back in 2008 about this\n\n\n\n“But the problem is that the body can make fructose. And it turns out that the favorite way it makes fructose is through high glucose levels.” – Rick Johnson\n\nClassic diabetes is a high glucose state\nIt’s been known for decades that there’s the enzyme that gets turned on in high glucose states called the polyol pathway (shown in the figure below) and that enzyme can convert glucose to sorbitol, and sorbitol then gets converted to fructose\n\nBTW, sorbitol is considered an artificial sugar so be aware that it gets turned into fructose in the body (see the figure below)\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16741\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f7-rickjohnson2-1024x399.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f7-rickjohnson2-1024x399.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f7-rickjohnson2-300x117.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f7-rickjohnson2-768x299.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f7-rickjohnson2-1536x598.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f7-rickjohnson2.png 1812w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 7.

but it doesn’t produce a lot of glucose\n\nThe glucose concentrations in the liver and blood don’t go up with broccoli\n\n\nWhen someone eats bread, rice, potatoes, chips, cereals (or other high glycemic foods), this gets broken down to glucose in the gut\n\nStarch gets broken down to glucose in the gut\nA continuous glucose monitor will show a rise in blood glucose after eating these foods\nGlucose will also go up in the liver\nWe don’t know what the difference is in the portal vein\n\nThese studies have not been done, but that would be very helpful\nThere is something called the first-pass effect; for nutrients that go to the liver, some are used by the liver first before it gets into the blood\nSo a lot of the glucose that enters the liver  is quickly sequestered in the liver cells and metabolized, and then some of it passes through to the blood\n\n\nGlucose in the blood is like the tip of the iceberg; the glucose levels in the liver are likely higher\n\n\nBread is going to be much more fattening if the enzyme aldose reductase is elevelated in the liver\n\nRick would love to develop an assay to measure aldose reductase in peripheral blood\n\nIt’s expressed in the liver but it can be measured in the plasma\nSorbitol is a good marker showing activation of this pathway [the polyol pathway, shown in the previous figure]\n\n\n\n\nAldose reductase is the rate limiting enzyme that converts glucose to sorbitol\n\nIt’s normally present in low levels in the liver, but it gets induced\nIt can be induced by high glucose or high uric acid\nThere’s a positive feedback system because when fructose is metabolized, uric acid is generated; and uric acid then goes back and tries to turn on the enzymes that can lead to more fructose metabolism\n\n\nThe action of high glucose levels activating aldose reductase has been shown in humans as well as in animals as well as in cell culture\n\nThis is the basis for original concerns about the polyol pathway being important in diabetic complication\nThis has been known for 50 years\n\n\nRick has published the observation that uric acid is a stimulus for aldose reductase, observed in animal studies and cell culture\n\nPublished in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in 2019, Uric acid activates aldose reductase and the polyol pathway for endogenous fructose and fat production causing development of fatty liver in rats\nPublished in PLoS One in 2012, Uric acid stimulates fructokinase and accelerates fructose metabolism in the development of fatty liver\nThis has not been shown in humans yet, but he believes it is likely true of humans too\n\n\nUric acid becomes clinically relevant and might turn on the polyol pathway at levels over 7 mg/dL in a human\n\nThis is what is seen in metabolic syndrome \n\n\n\n \nFindings from animal studies of glucose and fructose consumption [29:00]\nObesity and insulin resistance\n\nRick thought that giving glucose to animals would not cause obesity because glucose would maintain ATP levels (a deficit of ATP would not occur)\nFructose is activating this metabolic syndrome through dropping ATP levels\nWhen he did the experiment, and gave mice glucose, over time they became very very fat and insulin resistant\n\nMice were given glucose in drinking water; their water was 10% glucose \nControl mice received plain water\nBoth groups had access to the same chow\n\nPublished in Nature Communications in 2013, Endogenous fructose production and metabolism in the liver contributes to the development of metabolic syndrome\n\n\nThey also used a control where animals received water with Splenda in it, this tastes sweet but contains no calories\n\nPublished in the American Journal of Physiology Endocrinology and Metabolism in 2020, Sugar causes obesity and metabolic syndrome in mice independently of sweet taste\n\n\n\n\nWhen he looked in the liver, he found that maybe as much as 25% of the glucose was being converted to fructose in these laboratory mice\nWhen he gave mice fructose in their water, they get fat\nIt takes months to really see the effects of glucose or fructose to cause obesity\n\nWhat happens when mice are given glucose or fructose in their drinking water?\n\nWhen mice are given glucose/ fructose in their drinking water, initially thy drink a lot more than they would normally\n\nControl mice that had water + Splenda also drank more\n\n\nThey’re getting a fair amount of caloric intake from the water because it has sugar in it\nWhen an animal gets calories in their water, they reduce how much food they eat\n\nThis is a normal process; it’s true for sugar (sucrose), glucose, and fructose \n\n\nOver a period of a month or so, the mice drinking sugar calories start eating more, despite still drinking a lot\n\nThis results in a high caloric state\n\n\nThen they start developing leptin resistance\n\nLeptin is a hormone produced in the fat cells that tells the brain that it’s full\nIt’s what they call a satiety signal; it says, okay, you’ve eaten enough\nWhen normal mice are injected with leptin, they will reduce their food intake immediately, within hours, by 30%\nInjecting leptin doesn’t decrease appetite in humans because, most overweight people are resistant to leptin\n\nOverweight people almost always have very high leptin levels \nIn leptin resistance, leptin signaling is not working\n\n\n\n\nLeptin resistance is how fructose causes animals to eat more\n\nThis takes a month or so, but giving animals fructose leads to the animals becoming resistant to leptin\n\n\nLeptin resistance can be determined experimentally— inject an animal with leptin and if they continue to eat a normal amount they are resistant to leptin\n\nHe tests all his animals this way\nNormal animals are sensitive to a leptin injection and will begin to eat less\nIf animals are born with low leptin, they will be hungry and eat more\nIf animals become resistant to leptin, they can have a high leptin level but will not respond to it; so they will eat more\n\n\nEvidence of leptin resistance can also be determined by studying the hypothalamus\n\nThere is a change in the hypothalamus, phosphorylation of STAT3\nPublished in PNAS in 2018, High salt intake causes leptin resistance and obesity in mice by stimulating endogenous fructose production and metabolism\n\n\nThe mechanism of leptin resistance is not fully known, but there’s some evidence that it might be due to uric acid\n\nA group in China injected uric acid in the brains of animals and showed that caused leptin resistance\nThey also showed that this caused inflammation in the hypothalamus\nInflammation in the hypothalamus is thought to be the driver for leptin resistance\nPublished in PNAS in 2018, High salt intake causes leptin resistance and obesity in mice by stimulating endogenous fructose production and metabolism\n\n\nBack to the mouse experiment, when animals get glucose to drink they initially reduce their chow intake; but over time they start increasing their chow intake \n\nThen they become very fat and insulin resistant\nThey develop all features of metabolic syndrome \nWhen he looks at their livers, they’re making fructose and they’ve turned on this enzyme (aldose reductase), this polyol pathway is high \nAnd so they are gaining weight and becoming fat related to fructose production\n\n\n\nEffects of glucose consumption in mice lacking fructokinase\n\nFurther support of this comes from experiments where glucose was given to animals that lack fructokinase\n\nThese are genetically manipulated mice where the gene for fructokinase has been removed (knocked out)\nThese animals cannot metabolize fructose through this ATP depletion pathway\n\n\nGive animals without fructokinase glucose to drink and they gain some weight and fat\n\nThis is probably related to the effects of insulin\n\nGlucose stimulates insulin and insulin can decrease fat breakdown in the peripheral fat\n\n\nThese animals do not develop insulin resistance or fatty liver\nThey’re really protected from the metabolic syndrome and they gain much less weight and have less fat\nThese animals are eating the same calories as control animals that have a functioning fructokinase \nPublished in Nature Communications in 2013, Endogenous fructose production and metabolism in the liver contributes to the development of metabolic syndrome\n\n\nHe does lots of pair feeding studies, in this case mice lacking fructokinase are drinking the same amount of glucose as normal controls (that have fructokinase)\n\nThere may be 3-5% difference, but it’s very similar\nThe difference in body weight and fat is remarkable\n\n\nSo when he gave just glucose alone, the animals gained a little bit of weight, they drank a lot of glucose\n\nThey still gained a little bit of weight compared to a mouse that didn’t get glucose, even when the fructokinase was knocked out  \nA mouse that just gets glucose alone really gains weight\nA mouse that gets glucose in which they cannot metabolize fructose, gains dramatically less weight, but it’s still a little bit more than normal\n\n\n\n\nTo recap the experimental design—\n\nBoth animals get glucose in their water + chow\nOne animal has functional fructokinase and the other does not\nBoth animals presumably can make the same amount of fructose\nThe conversion of glucose to sorbitol to fructose is not impaired\nOnly 1 animal cannot convert fructose to fructose-1-phosphate (and therefore cannot metabolize fructose); this is the knockout\nFructose levels are still high in the fructokinase knockout, they can’t metabolize it\n\n\n\n\nPeter wants to understand this from an energy balance perspective, what is the difference between normal and knockout animals?\nWhen fructokinase is blocked animals regulate their weight, regulate their caloric intake\n\nWhen he gives fructose and glucose to animals, initially they reduce their cow so that they maintain the normal weight\nBut after the leptin resistance kicks in, they start eating more chow than they need and so they go into a positive energy balance where they’re eating a lot more than they normally do; this is associated with weight gain\nWhen he gives glucose to an animal that is a fructokinase knockout, what happens is it continues to keep its chow low; so even though it’s drinking a lot of glucose, the chow stays low so that the overall energy intake only very mildly increases\nPublished in Cell Metabolism in 2020, Deletion of Fructokinase in the Liver or in the Intestine Reveals Differential Effects on Sugar-Induced Metabolic Dysfunction \n\n\nThe fructokinase knockout mice eat less\nBoth groups get the exact same amount of glucose but they’re eating different amounts of chow\n\nThe chow contains everything: fat, protein and glucose\n\n\nHe did an isocaloric experiment too; this compared mice drinking fructose/glucose and eating chow\n\nThis compared fructokinase knockouts and wild type mice\nPublished in Cell Metabolism in 2020, Deletion of Fructokinase in the Liver or in the Intestine Reveals Differential Effects on Sugar-Induced Metabolic Dysfunction\nThe hypothesis is that the fructokinase knockouts would be protected from the negative effects of fructose\n\nBoth the fructose that they’re eating directly and the fructose that they will make from glucose\n\n\nThe groups were paired so that animals were eating the same total calories\nThis showed a dramatic difference in fatty liver and insulin resistance\nTo really simplify the findings, he identified that fructose stimulates obesity and metabolic syndrome and it does it through two major ways:\n\n1) By encouraging an animal to eat more; it basically stimulates hunger and stimulates food intake\n\nPart of that is through the brain and part of that is through this leptin resistance, which is also kind of a brain effect\nThe animals eat more \n\n\n2) They also drop their resting energy metabolism\nSo they’re both metabolizing less [metabolism is shifted toward fat synthesis away from energy/ ATP synthesis] and they’re eating more and that causes the weight gain\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat calorie-controlled studies say about the claim that a “calorie is a calorie” [42:15]\nThe claim that a calorie is a calorie\n\nPeter asks what he would say to those who claim that a calorie is a calorie, they’re all the same\n\nAlso, does this effect of fructose reduce resting energy expenditure?  Does it reduce the energetic drive and spontaneous energy expenditure?\n\n\nRick says no, this is still the first mechanism\n\nFructose “makes you gain weight by increasing energy intake and dropping energy metabolism” \n\n\n\n“What happens is a lot of weight gain from sugar is because you are eating more and exercising less” – Rick Johnson\n\nIn this situation resting energy metabolism is less, movement is less\n\nProblems with claims by the high fructose corn syrup industry [43:30]\n\nMost weight gain from sugar is due to eating more\n\nSome weight gain is due to a decrease in energy metabolism \nWhen Rick used an isocaloric diet (so all the animals, the controls and the sugar-fed animals are eating the exact same amount) there’s minimal difference in weight gain in the short term, in a 2 month study\nThere’s a little bit of weight gain because of the decreased energy metabolism in the fructose group, but it can be hard to show and the high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) industry loves this\n\nThe HFCS industry says the problem is people are eating too much and sugar is safe\nBecause isocaloric studies looking at the short term show no difference in weight gain\nThis misses the point that the sugar is actually causing hunger and by forcing an isocaloric diet, the people are hungry, but they’re not able to eat because they’re not allowed to eat\nIf a longer term was studied (a year), these studies would probably  show a difference in weight gain because of the difference in energy metabolism\n\n\n\n\nPeter puts some numbers to this to compare a high fructose diet to a high glucose diet, “if the high fructose group was driven to eat an extra 300 calories per day, while simultaneously experiencing a reduction of energy expenditure of 25 calories per day, the increase in the drive to eat 300 calories a day would be readily apparent. Again, this is very back of the envelope math.”\nRick agrees, this is correct\nBy these numbers, every 12 days would result in a 1-lb gain on the intake side but it would takes months to show a 1 lb gain on the energy expenditure side\n The other problem in the industry is they’ll compare fructose to glucose\n\nBut we know that some of the glucose is being converted to fructose, so it’s really not a fair comparison\n\n\nBut there’s another major mechanism, even if animals are pair fed (so that they’re eating the exact same amount), there may not be a difference in weight gain because they’re all eating the exact same number of calories \n\nThis doesn’t take into account that the animals eating more fructose are leptin resistant\n\nThey can’t eat what they want to eat\nThey’re presumably less happy; they’re hungry\nThis is due to the non caloric pathway of fructose metabolism shown in the figure below\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16742\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f8-rickjohnson2-1024x377.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f8-rickjohnson2-1024x377.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f8-rickjohnson2-300x110.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f8-rickjohnson2-768x283.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f8-rickjohnson2-1536x565.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f8-rickjohnson2.png 1924w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 8.  The noncaloric pathway of fructose metabolism contributes to obesity and disease.  Image credit: Obesity 2019  \n\nEven when animals are given the exact same diet, all the other metabolic effects of fructose are still going on\nThe group getting a high fructose diet still becomes insulin resistant\nThey’re still getting fatty liver\nThey’re still getting hypertension\nIt’s observed in animals and Rick has seen clinical evidence of this in people too\n\nStudies in mice comparing a 40% sucrose diet to an isocaloric 10% starch diet\n\n A great example, he was doing a pair feeding study of 40% sugar versus starch and so the animals were getting the exact same amount of food \n\nPublished in Metabolism in 2011, Sucrose induces fatty liver and pancreatic inflammation in male breeder rats independent of excess energy intake\nA pair feeding means let’s say there are 10 animals in this group and 10 animals in the other group; they have to eat the same amount of food each day \nThis means is that the animal that eats the least amount of food, all the other animals have to eat this same/least amount of food\nHis group was doing this study and didn’t know 1 of the animals had cancer and was hardly eating anything\n\nThis adjusted the diet for the study\nNow the animals were on a severe diet\n\n\n1 group had a diet of 40% sugar and the other 40% starch; everything was equal\nAt the end of the 4 months, the sugar fed animals tended to have a higher weight but it wasn’t significant\n\nThis was due to changes in resting metabolism, due to the fact that they had a lower energy metabolism \nAnd it looked like it would’ve been significant if they’d gone a little bit longer\n\n\nThis study went for 4 months; to put this in perspective, mice live for 2.5 years\n\nThis was like 15 years in a human\n\n\n\n\nPeter summarizes— this suggests that at least in a calorie controlled state, excess fructose does not alter energy expenditure in any clinically relevant manner \n\nEnergy expenditure is not a driver of adiposity\nRick thinks it is over decades; maybe half a pound a year\n\nIt depends on the individual\n\n\n\n\nOne can’t completely separate decreased energy expenditure increased food intake that accompanies this in people\nThe other thing that happened is these animals that got sugar, every one of them became diabetic\n\nEvery animal had severe fatty liver; it was a dramatic difference from the starch fed animals\nThe islets of the pancreas were showing changes of type two diabetes as well\nPeter clarifies that neither group of animals were overweight at the end of this study, but one of them became very skinny fat (metabolically unhealthy)\n\n\nRick’s work has shown multiple times that there are many, many effects from fructose that are independent of calories and it’s due to this energy depletion pathway\n\nOne of the consequences of this energy depletion is that it stimulates food intake\n\n\n\n“Part of obesity really is as eating more and exercising or moving less” – Rick Johnson\n\nObesity is not behavioral driven so much as due to activated biologic pathways\nThe figure below summarizes metabolism of dietary fructose and endogenously produced fructose;

Metabolism of fructose contributes to disease.  Image credit: Journal of Internal Medicine 2020\n \nImplications for aging and disease [51:15]\nLong-term effects of a high sugar diet\n\nRick thinks this whole pathway is very important in aging\n\n“I’ve always felt that obesity is a passenger that comes along for the ride, but it’s the metabolic derangement that lies under obesity, that’s highly correlated with obesity, but is quite separate from obesity that’s the root cause of our mortality” – Peter Attia\n\nLong studies in Rick’s mice would be one experimental way to demonstrate this; it’s not beyond the realm of doing\nRick has proposed to do this study\nThere has been some interesting studies looking at the effects of sugar on aging done in fruit flies (Drosophila) \nThe fruit fly actually is eating fruit; that’s what they like\n\nThey are always on some fructose, but they’re not getting highly concentrated fructose\n\nBecause the fruit also has lots of other things in it, fiber and other things, flavanols and some of them neutralize some of the effects of sugar\n\n\n\n\nBut if you give a fruit fly sucrose or table sugar, which is really fructose and glucose together, they love liquid sucrose and there are studies showing that they will develop obesity\n\nThese obese, insulin resistant flies will die early \nWhen they die, they die from complications related to uric acid production, which is really interesting\nThey develop the equivalent of kidney failure \n\n\n\nAging-associated renal disease\n\nRick is interested in whether or not mice that lack fructose metabolism (fructokinase knockouts) might live longer than normal mice \nHe has some he’s keeping around and they are on a normal mouse chow diet that is very low in fructose\n\nHe compared the fructokinase knockout mice to wild type mice\nThese animals are eating almost no fructose; it’s less than 3% of their chow\nThey get glucose in the form of starch in the chow; they get a fair amount of carbohydrate\nThis is a standard, low-sugar chow\nHe took these mice out a little over 2 years and found they stayed lean compared to control mice; this was statistically significant\n\nPublished in the American Journal of Physiology Renal Physiology in 2016, Aging-associated renal disease in mice is fructokinase dependent\n\n\nThese mice tended to have normal blood pressure or lower than control animals\n\nTo measure blood pressure in mice they use a cuff on their tail; this measures systolic pressure\nTheir blood pressure is similar to ours, 100-120\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks if they were significantly leaner than wild type control and if he documented how much less they were eating\n\nRick didn’t measure that but in retrospect, it was very important to know\n2 years is a lot of laboratory time \n\n\n\nEffects of fructose metabolism on the kidneys\n\nNormal mice show aging changes in their kidneys \n\nThis is true for all mice and rats and humans;\n\n\nBut the fructokinase knockout had no aging changes in their kidney\n\nTheir blood pressure was pretty normal, it tended to be a little bit lower\nThey did a study and showed if they were given salt, normal animals had a higher rise in blood pressure than fructokinase knockout animals\n\nBut the baseline blood pressure in these animals was not really different\n\n\nThere is a difference in response to salt; this has been reported in aging\n\nPeople become more sensitive to the effects of salt with aging\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks, “what do you hypothesize was the difference between the kidney function in these two animals?”\n\n“The dramatic thing is that the fructokinase knockout were protected from aging associated changes to the kidney and so it suggests that endogenous fructose production is maybe more important than we think and that it could have a role in the aging process” – Rick Johnson\n\nEndogenous fructose production can be quantified; a recent study labeled fructose and gave it to people in a soft drink\n\nThis study found that when people drank the soft drink, they increased the production of fructose by 3-4x\nNote, we are always making some fructose in our bodies\nPublished in Clinical Nutrition ESPEN in 2019, The extra-splanchnic fructose escape after ingestion of a fructose-glucose drink: An exploratory study in healthy humans using a dual fructose isotope method \n\n\n\nFatty liver disease\n\nPeter wants to put this in perspective with his patients\n\nWhen he has a patient with fatty liver disease, the first thing he does is restrict fructose and alcohol\nHe stops all alcohol and drops fructose intake dramatically to typically 5 to 10 grams per day, which basically means vegetables and a handful of berries if they must have some fruit\n\nIt’s a minimal fruit diet and no alcohol\nThis is before calorie restriction or manipulation of other macros, carbohydrates, etc.\nThis usually improves non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in most people\nThey may or may not lose weight\n\n\nThese conditions reverse NAFLD without a huge amount of weight loss\n\nThese patients often lose weight because they are also in a state of positive energy balance\nStudies from David Ludwig’s group, Rob Lustig, Miriam Vos, etc. have looked at this (refer to the selected links section at the end)\nOne of the challenges that all of these investigators have had is maintaining the weight of the fructose restricted group\n\n\n\n\nRick’s group was the first to report that fructose could be a cause of fatty liver\n\nPublished in the Journal of Hepatology in 2008, Fructose Consumption as a Risk Factor for Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease \nThis study with Manal Abdelmalek at the University of Florida, and found that patients who were drinking large amounts of soft drinks had high uric acid levels \n\nWhen they looked at liver biopsies, they found an increased expression of fructokinase by 3-4x\n\n\n\n\nHe started putting people on low fructose diets (in addition to low alcohol) for treating fatty liver\n\nOne of the people in his lab had a son who developed fatty liver but was skinny\n\nIt turns out he was drinking soft drinks almost every day\nSimply cutting that out was enough\n That was one of the precipitants for Rick to write his first book, the dramatic effects seen in some people with fructose restriction\n\n\n\n\n\n“But now we know that it isn’t just the fructose you drink, it’s the fructose you make” – Rick Johnson\n \nImpact of endogenous fructose production on obesity and metabolic syndrome [1:01:30]\nTypical fructose consumption in the American diet\n\nAbout 15-20% of the diet is from sugar (and sugar is half fructose and half glucose)\nSo 10-15% of the diet is fructose\n\nFructose comes from added sugars, fruit, and other foods\n\n\nSugar in the diet can vary; some people are eating as much as 25% of their diet as sugar\n\nSo people can be eating as much as 15, even 20% of their diet as fructose\n\n\nConservatively, it’s not hard to eat 100 grams of fructose a day\n\n400 calories of fructose could represent 15% of the daily caloric intake\n\n\nLet’s say the average American is eating 75-100 g of fructose; that’s their exogenous consumption of fructose\n\nLet’s assume that person is a little bit insulin resistant and a little bit leptin resistant (but not off the charts); what is their endogenous production of fructose?\nA guess (based on animal data) would be around 25-50% more fructose comes from endogenous production\n\n\n\nEndogenous fructose production\n\nThere are 3 major sources for endogenous fructose production\n\n1) High glycemic carbs such as rice, potatoes, bread, and chips [he will come back to the other 2 sources]\n\nMaybe a quarter of that can be turned into fructose\nRick thinks this is playing a major role in metabolic syndrome\n\n\nWhen someone is young and the polyol enzyme pathway is not activated, eating things like potatoes and French fries may not cause so much weight gain, you may feel you’re invincible, but as this pathway gets activated and aldose reductase starts being highly expressed in the liver, then potatoes and bread may cause much more weight gain\n\n\n\nStudies in fructokinase knockout mice\n\nHe did another study where animals were given soft drinks/ high fructose corn syrup\n\nThey got really fat and insulin resistant\nBut if he blocked fructokinase, this completely blocked development of metabolic syndrome\n\nSugar causes obesity and metabolic syndrome in mice independently of sweet taste | American Journal of Physiology Endocrinology and Metabolism (A Andres-Hernando et al. 2020) | [35:45; 1:04:00]\n\n\nSo with soft drinks, it really was all fructose, even though there’s a lot of glucose in there\nHe saw a little bit of weight gain with glucose alone\n\n\n\n“When we give high fructose corn syrup, it was… the fructose that was causing them to gain weight and to get metabolic syndrome” –  Rick Johnson\n \nWhy vulnerability to the negative effects of sugar increases with age and menopause [1:04:30]\nThe important role of the mitochondria\n\nPeter asks what is it about aging that alters our sensitivity or vulnerability to glucose?\n\nRick mentioned that when we are young, we can tolerate lot of high glycemic foods\n\n\nRick notes there are 3-4 reasons\n\n1) when we’re young, we tend to have very healthy mitochondria\nKids are active, and this keeps the mitochondria healthy\nFructose works by causing oxidative stress to the mitochondria. this activates these pathways\nBut if the mitochondria are really powerful, these metabolic effects won’t develop as easily, because the mitochondria are more resistant to the effects of fructose\n\nThis is seen in super athletes; they have fantastic mitochondria\nMany of them feel like they can drink a lot of sugar and they’re immune and it’s because they have really, really healthy mitochondria\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks what it means to have healthy mitochondria; why is mitochondrial dysfunction viewed as one of the hallmarks of aging?\nMitochondria are one of your major places where energy is made\n\nIn fact, it’s the high output energy producer, so it’s producing the ATP that we need to drive everything we do\n\n\nOver many years, the mitochondria get less good at making the energy because of damage, recurrent damage, and it’s thought that oxidative stress to the mitochondria can cause this damage\n\nAnd so when you want to try to store fat, mitochondrial oxidative stress is part of the requirement to store fat and fructose works to store fat by stimulating mitochondrial oxidative stress\nInitially, this is an easily reversible mechanism\n\n\nOxidative stress inhibits these enzymes and it leads to fat production and so forth; this is a survival pathway\nBut when the mitochondria is continually stimulated with oxidative stress, the mitochondria become unhealthy\n\nThis has been shown with fructose; the mitochondria start to decrease and the mitochondrial change\nThe mitochondria become smaller and less efficient\nThe mitochondrial function starts to reduce; the number of mitochondria becomes less\nWhen that happens, less ATP is made\n\nThis is associated with feeling more fatigue, more tired\nLower ATP levels in the muscle is associated with muscle fatigue\n\n\n\n\n\n“Your natural gait will slow down as your mitochondrial function decreases, and it’s all associated with aging” – Rick Johnson\n\nPeter asks how this is quantified in animals; are muscle biopsies taken?\nThe mitochondria themselves can be measured by looking at them with an electron microscope\nIt can be measured indirectly with PCR\n\nThe number of mitochondria can be determined by measuring the ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA\n\n\nATP levels can be measured in tissues\nThere are lots of ways to measure mitochondrial function, but what we know is it tends to decrease with age\nThere is good evidence that recurrent chronic oxidative stress to the mitochondria is involved in decreased mitochondrial function\nRick thinks that fat storage is associated with mitochondrial oxidative stress\n\nSo if these pathways are continually stimulated with fructose, that may actually wear down the mitochondria\n\n\nRick did a study in humans where people were put on a low fructose diet \n\nThis showed that mitochondrial biogenesis could be increased in people within 30 days\n\nThere was a very dramatic increase in mitochondrial production\n\n\nPublished in Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology & Diabetes in 2013, Low fructose and low salt diets increase mitochondrial DNA in white blood cells of overweight subjects \n\n\n\nFasting and calorie restriction can also increase the number of mitochondria and function\n\nFasting is thought to increase mitochondrial probably the same way, and actually even caloric restriction\nThe concept that caloric restriction can be beneficial to reduce aging is probably through this pathway\n\nThe process of eating and storing fat seems to involve some mitochondrial oxidative stress \nAnd so if one eats less food, they’re going to have less oxidative stress to the mitochondria and less fat stores\nThis will allow them to live longer\n\n\nReduce aging by reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress\nAnimals always want to have some extra fat on board because they’re living in the wild\n\nThey need to be prepared for a sudden food shortage\n\n\nWhen he puts animals on a diet, 70% of their normal caloric intake, their fat stores become very minimal\n\nThey have less oxidative stress to their mitochondria and they’re going to live longer\nTheir mitochondria are going to stay healthier\nBut if these animals are put in the wild, the first food crisis will kill half of them \n\nThey can’t survive because they don’t have enough energy stores\nSo in the wild, animals want to have a little bit of extra fat\n\n\n\n\n\n“The obesity paradox is hard to ignore, that low levels of obesity actually seem protective” – Peter Attia\n\nIf someone has cancer or heart failure or any kind of chronic disease, they’ll actually live longer if they have fat stores,\n\nSomeone who has a BMI (body mass index) of 27 is going to do better than someone with a BMI of 20 when they both have a chronic illness\nEven a person that has a BMI of 28 is going to do better than a person with a BMI of 24 as they age\nWe need to have a little bit of fat stores\n\n\n\nWhy is this a problem associated with aging? [1:11:30]\n\nBack to the original question, why is it when people are young they can eat bread without a problem?\nThis is because their mitochondria are healthier and they have metabolic flexibility; they can metabolize things very easily \nBut over time, the more sugar we eat, the better we get at metabolizing it\nNormally, when we eat sugar the transporter for fructose in our gut is expressed at low levels\n\nAnimals that get fructose when they’re young tend not to absorb it as well\n\n\nBut the more we get exposed to sugar, the better we get at absorbing it\n\nWe turn on the enzymes and the transporters that allow us to absorb fructose more readily\n\n\nFor example, give an animal sugar for a month, they’ll up regulate all these pathways\nMaybe if they stop eating sugar for one day, and then are given a bolus of sugar (a large, single dose), they get a very dramatic activation of this switch and the fallen energy\n\nIt’s very dramatic compared to a normal animal that’s not been exposed to sugar that gets a single dose\nAnd that’s because we turn on these pathways, so we turn on the ability to metabolize sugar\n\n\n\nStudies in children\n\nHe did a study in children where they gave them a dose of fructose\n\nPublished in Pediatric Obesity in 2015 in Oral fructose absorption in obese children with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease \nThey compared lean, obese children, and obese children with fatty liver (known by liver biopsy)\nThey were given a dose of fructose; this was a liquid bolus, about 1 g per kg of body weight\nThe lean children only absorbed about 70% of the fructose and they metabolized it slowly\nThe kids that were obese, they absorbed much more fructose and they metabolized it a little bit faster, but they still didn’t absorb it all\nThe kids that had fatty liver and obesity and they absorbed a 100% of it and they metabolized it faster\n\nHe thinks this is because of prior exposure to sugar and so forth\nThere could possibly be genetic differences\nBut in animals, the more sugar they are given, the more they’ll absorb; there’s other data in humans to support this as well\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms that make one sensitive to fructose over time\n\n1) Mitochondria tend to be healthier when one is young\n2) The more sugar one eats, the more they are able to absorb and metabolize\n3) The polyol pathway also gets turned on over time\nBy the time someone has metabolic syndrome, they probably have this enzyme [aldose reductase] turned on\n\nThey have high uric acid; this can activate the polyol pathway too\nThey convert glucose to fructose\n\n\nFor someone who is overweight and cuts out sugar and fructose\n\nThey are still gaining weight probably because their body is making a lot of fructose\n\nThe body makes fructose from high glycemic carbs; this is the #1 food that is used to generate fructose\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat effect does menopause have on this?\n\nPeter asks about menopause\nEstrogen increases uric acid excretion\nYoung women tend to have lower uric acid levels compared to men\nWhen women go through menopause and estrogen levels fall, uric acids increase and suddenly post-menopausally women suddenly develop obesity, diabetes, heart disease\n\nThe rates of these diseases in post-menopausal women become more like males\n\n\nPremenopausal, estrogen is providing some protection\n\nThis can certainly be overwhelmed by eating a lot of sugar and so forth\n\n\nMenopause is related to this change in uric acid\nFructose metabolism will be up regulated by uric acid\n\nWhen uric acid goes up, not only does it turn on the polyol pathway, but it actually up regulates fructokinase as well\n\n\nHe’s shown in animals that when uric acid is raised, this raises the fructokinase levels and also amplifies the effects of sugar\n\nPublished in PLoS One in 2012, Uric acid stimulates fructokinase and accelerates fructose metabolism in the development of fatty liver\n\n\nThere is also a direct relationship between uric acid and aldose reductase\n\nPublished in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in 2019,  Uric acid activates aldose reductase and the polyol pathway for endogenous fructose and fat production causing development of fatty liver in rats \n\n\nPeter asks if someone is given allopurinol to knock their uric acid from 7-4 mg/dL, does this reduce the conversion of glucose to sorbitol?\n\nRick hasn’t done this experiment; it’s a great question; it would be a good study\n\n\n\n \nDietary strategies to reduce the negative impact of fructose [1:16:30]\n\nPeter asks “What do people need to be wary of? I mean, I think the other question that emerges from a discussion like this for many people is, oh my God, do I need to not eat any fructose? This means I can’t have any fruit. Tomatoes have fructose in them… how do we provide some insight to people so that they can figure out how to adjust the dose of something that is something that is completely ubiquitous?” \n\nSo if you want to go on a zero fructose diet, you’re going to have a hard time\nThat’s not going to work\n\n\nThe first thing Rick recommends is try not to drink liquids that have lots of sugar in them— soft drinks and fruit juices\n\nReview of risks of liquid sugars, published in Obesity in 2019, Are Liquid Sugars Different from Solid Sugar in Their Ability to Cause Metabolic Syndrome?\n\n\nSports drinks are interesting because some are really low in fructose\n\nMaybe 2-4% fructose and 6% glucose\n6% glucose means there are 60 grams of glucose per liter\n\n\nSoft drinks are about 11% sugar— 6% fructose and 5% glucose\n\nThis is on the order of 110 g total sugar per liter\n\n\n\n“That really is bad stuff; soft drinks should… be banned” – Rick Johnson\nSports drinks\n\nSports drinks were developed originally by Bob Cade and the invention of Gatorade\n\nPeople who are exercising a lot are losing lots of salt in their sweat; they’re burning up glucose, and some of them were getting hypoglycemic on the field\nSports drinks were really meant to help replenish the electrolytes and to fix the glucose problem \n\nGlucose is fuel for the muscle during heavy bouts of exercise; we often use a lot of glucose during exercise\n\n\nThe original sports drinks were glucose rich and had a lot of salt and water\nSome studies that showed that oxidation of glucose could be facilitated by having a little bit of fructose in the drink\n\nHaving a small amount of fructose actually accelerated glucose uptake; this worked primarily in the gut\nPerformance was increased by having small amounts of fructose (2-3%) and the optimal glucose in sports drinks was found to be 5-6%\n\n\nNow, some sports drinks actually have more fructose in it because it tastes better and that’s a problem\n\nBut for someone out there exercising, using a sports drink for what it’s meant for, then this is fine\nBut drinking sports drinks without exercise, in front of the TV, is probably not a good idea\n\n\n\n\n\nFruit juice\n\nThe sugar content of freshly squeezed orange juice is probably about two thirds of a soft drink\nApple juice is sweeter, it’s equivalent to a soft drink\nThe Pediatric Society a long time ago realized that juice has so much fructose that it was being associated with obesity in children\n\nThey made recommendations to limit fruit juice, to like 6 ounces or less for older children and 4 ounces or so for really small children\nRick thinks we should even limit it more\n\n\n\nWhole, fresh fruit\n\nNatural fruits are different; they have much less fructose in an individual fruit\n\nFruit juice is made from multiple fruits\nEat an orange and it has 6-8 grams of fructose, closer to 6 g of fructose and some glucose\nRick thinks natural fruits are fine, even for someone with NAFLD (fatty liver)\n\n\nThere are certain fruits that are high in sugar— mangoes, figs, dates\n\nFigs are very, very enriched in fructose; fFigs are probably something that we should avoid\n\n\nApples and pears, plums, tend to be fairly high, around 9-10 grams\nBananas are fairly high glycemic; they have a fair amount of fructose, but it’s probably in the range of 6-8 grams\nMost fruits are between 3-9 g, 10 g max, with the average being 4-6 g (see the table below)\nSome fruits have much less sugar— kiwi and berries (strawberries and blueberries)\n\nPeople  should be encouraged to eat these\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16744\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f10-rickjohnson2-1024x928.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"928\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f10-rickjohnson2-1024x928.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f10-rickjohnson2-300x272.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f10-rickjohnson2-768x696.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f10-rickjohnson2.png 1386w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 10. Fructose content per serving of fruit.  Image credit: Nature Wants Us to Be Fat\n\nRick did a study, they gave people a low sugar diet that was low in refined sugar and low in high fructose corn syrup\n\nPublished in Metabolism in 2011, The effect of two energy-restricted diets, a low-fructose diet versus a moderate natural fructose diet, on weight loss and metabolic syndrome parameters: a randomized controlled trial \nOne group got natural fruit, but was low sugar and low fructose\n\nIt was sort of a modest total fructose intake\n\n\nThe other group was restricted too\n\nIt was a low fructose diet that was low fructose in all aspects\n\n\nThey found equivalent improvement in metabolic syndrome in both groups\n\n\n\n“The presence of natural fruit did not block the ability of the low sugar diet to improve metabolic syndrome” – Rick Johnson\n\nPeter notes, “The takeaway here is don’t drink it and don’t consume added sugar, and I think this is a difficult thing for people to differentiate. So added sugar is when a food has sucrose or high fructose corn syrup.  These are typically the most common agents that are added to the food. So if you go and get a jar of pasta sauce, they have added sugar to it.” \n\nThis is not the sugar naturally present in the tomatoes; it’s deliberately added to make it taste sweeter\nRick agrees\n\n\nRemember the intestine acts as a shield for 4-6 grams of fructose\n\nEating 4-5 g of fructose in a fruit is okay because the intestine’s going to provide protection\nIn addition, there is fiber in a natural fruit and that slows the absorption so the concentration of fructose that goes to the liver is lower\n\nThis results in less ATP depletion\n\n\n\n\n\nDried fruit\n\nPeter asks about dried fruits.  How does apple chips compare to a whole apple, when considering equal amounts of calories?\n\n“The trouble with dried fruit is that it still has all the fructose, but a lot of the good things are removed… Dried fruit is sort of like candy.” – Rick Johnson\n\nIt’s not just the loss of water that’s a problem in dried fruit, things like vitamin C tend to be low\n\nPeter notes, “It’s hard to eat more than two apples in one sitting. It’s not hard to eat more than ten apples’ worth of apple chips in one sitting. So I really thought it was more of just a regulation of quantity.”\nThis may be true, but Rick has read that dried fruits do not contain as much of the good nutrients (see studies listed in the Selected Links section at the end)\n\n\nDried fruits are thought to be primarily devoid of the good components that are in fruit\n\nAnd we know that there are many other good components in fruit besides fiber\nThere’s potassium and flavonols\nThere’s a substance called epicatechin that’s in a lot of fruit that actually can block some of the effects of fructose\nOther things like luteolin and mangosteen (a fruit from Southeast Asia), and different flavonols also seem to block the effects of fructose\n\n\n\nEffects of blocking fructokinase activity in humans\n\nPeter asks, “how do I knock out my fructokinase? And maybe more interestingly, how much polymorphism exists in the fructokinase gene in humans that might account for differences in fructose tolerance?” \nThere is a condition called essential fructosuria; this is a hereditary condition in which a person does not have fructokinase\n\nThey pee about 10% of the fructose they eat (it goes out through the urine), and the rest is metabolized by the glucose enzymes because some of the glucose enzymes can metabolize fructose\nNo one with this condition has ever been reported with type II diabetes or obesity\nIt seems that it’s associated with normal lifespan or maybe even prolonged lifespan\nRick is  in connection with a small kindred or family that has this condition and interestingly, they can eat all the sugar they want, but they tend to prefer salty foods\n\n\nWhat is the hope for a pharmacologic agent that could block fructokinase as a treatment for obesity, type II diabetes, and NAFLD?\nDisclosure— Rick has a small company that’s trying to develop fructokinase  inhibitors for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and other conditions associated with fructose\nBut there are also several large pharma that are actively working on making fructokinase inhibitors\n\nEli Lilly is one that’s actively trying to make fructokinase inhibitors; they’re in phase I clinical trials right now\nPfizer actually had a success in a phase two trial where it reduced fatty liver pretty significantly and improved insulin resistance\n\n\nIt’s a very exciting future, if these inhibitors can be developed, it looks like they hold great promise\n\nIn animal studies, they can block sugar induced obesity and diabetes and fatty liver \n\n\nSadly, Pfizer stopped development of its fructokinase inhibitor, despite a positive phase II result\n\nHe doesn’t know why they stopped developing their drug\n\nNo toxicity was reported\nThe drug looked very promising\n\n\nThey have another drug they’re developing for fatty liver that also had very positive results\n\n\n\n \nThe role of hypertension in chronic disease and tips for lowering blood pressure [1:30:45]\nHigh blood pressure contributes to many chronic diseases\n\nBlood pressure seems to play a very important role in all the major chronic diseases, except for cancer\nPeter notes, “In neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renal disease (which are really the main pillars of death), hypertension seems to work against you” \nHigh blood pressure (aka primary or essential hypertension) is extraordinarily common in our country and throughout the world\n\nMaybe 1/3 of adults have high blood pressure\n\n\nHigh blood pressure is usually defined as a blood pressure greater than 140 over 90\n\nIn the US it was recently redefined as being greater than 130/80\n\n\nRick is a nephrologist, he takes care of the kidneys, the organ that is arguably the most sensitive to blood pressure (this is the first place where damage shows up)\nRick notes there are 3 main sites where high blood pressure really causes problems\n\n1) Stroke— high blood pressure is a major cause of stroke\n2) Heart failure— it’s a major cause of heart failure\n3) Kidney disease— it’s one of the 2 major causes of kidney disease\nThese are all pressure related conditions where the higher the pressure the higher the risk of these diseases\n\n\nStudies show that the greatest risk for these diseases occurs when the systolic blood pressure is 160-180 or higher\n\nThis is kind of a turning point, beyond which there is a dramatic increased risk for these conditions\n\n\nThere is a linear relationship between blood pressure and the risk of stroke and heart failure going all the way down to 120/80\nMost studies done in around 1900 showed that less than 5% of the population had blood pressures of over 140 over 90\n\nBased upon the normal Gaussian curve of the population back then, probably about 140 over 90 was the cutoff for what was thought to be high blood pressure\n\n\n\n“I’m a believer that 140 over 90 is a good mark for where we should be viewing hypertension as a condition that really should involve active management” – Rick Johnson\n\nRick believes there is  minimal risk with a blood pressure 135 over 85\n\nIn epidemiology studies over many years, it can be shown that 120/80 is superior to 135/ 85\n\n\nPeter comments that he freaks out when it comes to managing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in his patients because he’s not a nephrologist\n\nHe wants people to live to 100; most people aren’t going to but this is an aspiration\nA 40-year old patient with a GFR of 85 is normal; but Peter wants her to live to 100 not 80, so he needs to treat her like a 20-year old\n\nThis is why he wants to understand this\n\n\nIf he wants to get people’s kidneys to have a GFR above 40 at the age of 100, do the standards on hypertension need to be revised?\n\n\nRick replies, “the answer is we would prefer blood pressure of 120 over 80, but if it’s 135 over 85, to put someone on a medication that they’ll have to take for the next 60 years, I’m not sure that that’s the best way to go. I think that doing nutritional and exercise related maneuvers when you’re at 135 over 85 should be the way to go.”\n\nDietary changes can reduce blood pressure\n\nBlood pressure can be fixed by diet— reducing salt, picking healthier foods, and exercising\n\nBut the trouble with when someone gets to 140 over 90, if they can’t lower their blood pressure by dietary means, they should go on an antihypertensive medication because it will provide protection over time\n\n\nRick hasn’t seen any evidence that antihypertensives provide long term benefit to patients with a blood pressure of 135/85\n\nDietary measure makes sense\nHe’s not sure about pharmaceutical interventions\n\n\n\n“The trouble with defining hypertension at a lower level, is it implies that antihypertensive should be used at those lower levels and I don’t think that the evidence is strong enough to warrant that” – Rick Johnson\n\nPeter notes that “the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence”; perhaps this should be studied\n\nThis is  the same problem that we face when we try to think about this through the lens of cardiovascular disease, which is, is a 30 year old with an apoB of a hundred worse off than a 30 year old with an apoB of 70? \n\nThis episode discussed apoB in great detail: #185 – Allan Sniderman, M.D.: Cardiovascular disease and why we should change the way we assess risk\n\n\nThere’s no study that can answer that question because if one studies a 30 year old for the next five years, apoB of 70 versus, hell 170, they cannot see a difference over that period of time\n\nOne would have to study those people over their lifetimes\n\n\nIf one compares people with a blood pressure of 135/85 to 120/80 over five years, it’s not going to reveal enough of a difference\nSo it creates a bit of a problem with how the guidelines are created, but it shouldn’t confuse the underlying physiology\n\n\nRick agrees and notes, “I think if you use these more stringent definitions of hypertension, then suddenly a very large number of adults have hypertension. And if you then say that they need treatment for it in terms of like an antihypertensive, then you’re talking about probably the majority of the population.”\nOr Peter suggests that maybe the treatment is to reduce insulin resistance; Rick agrees\n\nDrugs aren’t great at reducing metabolic syndrome\n\n\n\n \nThe impact of fructose and uric acid on kidney function and blood pressure [1:39:45]\nMechanisms that drive high blood pressure\n\nThe first issue was known is that salt is important in blood pressure \n\nIn animals that are sensitive to high blood pressure, one can make blood pressure a lot worse by giving them salt.\nStudies from 1900 showed that if you took people with high blood pressure and you put them on a salt restriction, this lowered blood pressure\nThis has led to recommendations to restrict salt in people with high blood pressure\n\n\nNot everybody is sensitive to salt\n\nLot of people when they’re young can eat all the salt they want and they don’t seem to have so much of a problem\n\n\nBut as we get older, we become more and more sensitive to the effects of salt on blood pressure\n\nWhy is this?\nFor years, it was thought the problem is the kidneys in people with high blood pressure can’t excrete salt as easily or as well as normal people\n\nAnd so it was thought that there was some defect in the kidney\n\n\nTo make a long story short, over a decade of studying this revealed that people with high blood pressure have inflammation in their kidneys\n\nThis low grade inflammation in the kidneys is due to T-cells and macrophages\nThis inflammation tends to be in the main part of the kidney where the tubules are and around the little blood vessels\n\n\nStudies were able to prove that the inflammation was actually maintaining the kidney in a state where it couldn’t get rid of salt very well\n\nReviewed in Physiological Reviews in 2017, Role of the Immune System in Hypertension \n\n\nThis occurs by creating reduced blood flow to the kidney\n\n\nPeople with high blood pressure, they all have reduced blood flow to their kidneys\n\nWhen the blood flow is reduced, this affects the ability of the kidney to excrete salt, and triggers the retention of salt\n\n\nStudies revealed that high blood pressure is an inflammatory disease that is driven by inflammation\n\nBut then the question is, what is driving the inflammation?\n\n\nHe found that many things could drive inflammation in the kidneys\n\nSome drugs are very vasoconstrictive;  cocaine, for example, and other things that constrict the renal arteries \nActivation of the renin angiotensin system, for example, can cause ischemia to the kidneys and bring in this inflammation\nBut one thing that seems to drive it is a level of high uric acid\n\n\nHe did studies in adolescents who were overweight\n\nPublished in JAMA in 2008, Effect of allopurinol on blood pressure of adolescents with newly diagnosed essential hypertension: a randomized trial\nMany of them had high uric acid levels and were discovered to have high blood pressure\n\n\nHe did some studies in animals and saw that when they raised uric acid, the animals developed high blood pressure\n\nPublished in Nephron, Experimental Nephrology in 2012, Uric acid-induced endothelial dysfunction is associated with mitochondrial alterations and decreased intracellular ATP concentrations \n\n\nHe thought maybe the uric acid could be playing a role in blood pressure in humans\nHe did a study, done by Dan Feig (published it in JAMA) where they randomized adolescents with high blood pressure to drugs to lower uric acid or not\n\nThis is a study of kids with newly discovered hypertension; they’ve never been on any kind of drug at all\nHe put them on allopurinol, a drug that can lower uric acid\nThe results were remarkable, 90% of them normalized their blood pressure when their uric acid levels were lowered\nThere was a 5-8 mm drop in ambulatory blood pressure\n\n\n\nUric acid produced by fructose metabolism contributes to high blood pressure and metabolic disease: \n\nPeter asks about the 2009 study where patients were given 200 g fructose with and without allopurinol\n\nPublished in the International Journal of Obesity in 2010, Excessive fructose intake induces the features of metabolic syndrome in healthy adult men: role of uric acid in the hypertensive response\nWith treatment, their blood pressure was reduced 7 mm systolically and 5 diastolically\nIs this drop clinically significant?\nAbsolutely, when blood pressure goes up that much, it is definitely associated with increased cardiovascular events over time\nIt’s thought to be clinically significant when diastolic pressure can be lowered by more than 3 mm and the systolic pressure by more than 4-5 mm\nIn this study the blood pressure of all the patients went up quite significantly\n25% of the patients developed metabolic syndrome de novo, mainly because of a rise in blood pressure\n\n\nPeter asks about the mechanism responsible for these changes, is it all due to inflammation in the kidney? \nRick notes that it’s more complicated than that\n\nChronically elevated blood pressure is caused by inflammation in the kidney\nInflammation in the kidney is associated with high uric acid\nUric acid is also raising blood pressure directly through effects on blood vessels\n\nUric acid will inhibit nitric oxide; it will stimulate oxidative stress\n\n\nSpecifically, uric acid will reduce endothelial nitric oxide through multiple mechanisms\n\n1) It removes nitric oxide directly by binding to it\n2) It decreases the uptake of  L arginine, which is used to make nitric oxide\n3) There’s some models where it seems to be blocking the endothelial nitric oxide synthase\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks if he has looked at symmetric and asymmetric dimethylarginine levels as well? \n\nThere’s some association between these elevated levels and decreased renal function\nAnd it’s also believed to work through the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase\n\n\nRick notes, “High blood pressure is a very complicated problem. And we think that it’s initiated by eating foods high in salt and foods high in sugar. And if you give sugar to animals, blood pressure goes up acutely. And if you give sugar or fructose to humans, blood pressure goes up within minutes.”\n\nIf someone drinks a 20-ounce Coke, their blood pressure goes up 3-4 mm\n\n\nPeter asks about increased blood pressure in response to exercise\n\nWhen exercising, his blood pressure will go up 40 mm, but acutely, that’s not a problem\nAn acute change is not problematic but a chronic increase is\nChronically, exercise reduces blood pressure, inflammation, hepatic glucose, etc.\nHe notes, “I’m always a little bit worried when we talk about,you drink a Coke and this happens acutely without understanding what it’s doing chronically”\nRick agrees, Peter is absolutely right\n\n\n\nThe link between sugar and hypertension [1:48:15]\n\nSugar is linked epidemiologically with the development of hypertension\n\nPublished in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in 2010, Increased fructose associates with elevated blood pressure \n\n\nThere are studies out there where overweight people have gone on low-sugar diets and their blood pressure comes down\n\nThere’s evidence that it’s the fructose component that is driving the blood pressure response because acutely, giving fructose increases blood pressure \n\nGiving glucose does not increase blood pressure acutely\nSo fructose does something that raises blood pressure\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe potential role of sodium in hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome [1:49:00]\n\nRick’s group discovered that when animals are put on a salty diet, they actually start producing fructose in their bodies\n\nPublished in PNAS in 2018, High salt intake causes leptin resistance and obesity in mice by stimulating endogenous fructose production and metabolism\nSo salty foods turned out to be another way to stimulate fructose production\nAnd when you give salt chronically to animals, they get high blood pressure, they get hypertrophy of their heart, and they also develop metabolic syndrome\n\nThey actually develop obesity, insulin resistance and everything\n\n\n\n\n\n“That may seem surprising because we don’t think of salt as driving obesity, it’s non caloric. But actually there’s data in humans that high salt diet also increases the risk for obesity and insulin resistance besides hypertension” – Rick Johnson\nMechanisms: How salt raises blood pressure and stimulates endogenous production of fructose\n\nThe mechanism is that as the salt concentration in the blood goes up, it activates the polyol pathway and turns on this enzyme (aldose reductase) to make fructose\n\nAldose reductase converts glucose to fructose\nWhen one eats potato chips, the glucose and salt stimulates the enzyme to convert glucose to fructose\n\n\n\n“French fries are particularly fattening because they have the salt and the carbs that together really turn on this pathway to make fructose” – Rick Johnson\n\nThere is strong evidence in humans that serum sodium concentration activates aldose reductase; the data is very strong\n\nIncreased serum osmolality activates this pathway or increased salt concentration in the blood can activate the aldose reductase pathways\nThis data is very strong in humans; it’s very strong in all organisms.\nThe change in osmolality is key; this is why elevated glucose can also activate this pathway\n\nPeter notes that, “someone with type two diabetes and their glucose concentration is 140 milligrams per deciliter, that’s a huge osmolar load. So even if they have normal salt concentration, that could be activating it.” \n\n\n\n\nWhat is it about osmolality that activates this enzyme?\n\nThe promoter for aldose reductase has an osmol sensitive region that gets activated by a transcription factor called TonEBP (aka NFAT5)\n\nThis is a major mechanism that animals use when they get dehydrated\n\n\n\n\nDehydration or increases in the salt concentration of the blood when salty foods are eaten triggers thirst and the body starts making fructose from the glucose that has been eaten\n\nOver time, it appears that this fructose (as well as sugar) seems to be enough to drive metabolic syndrome \n\n\nSo salt and sugar both activate the pathway\n\nWhen animals are given salt, it takes them a longer time to gain weight as compared to sugar\n\nSugar’s pretty quick, but when they are given salt, it takes a few more months for the animals to really get overweight\n\n\n\n\nRick has done epidemiologic studies in humans, high salt intake increases the risk for fatty liver and diabetes\nOne study in Japanese adults, high salt also increased the risk for blood pressure\n\nPublished in Nutrients in 2020, Hyperosmolarity and Increased Serum Sodium Concentration Are Risks for Developing Hypertension Regardless of Salt Intake: A Five-Year Cohort Study in Japan\n\n\nIt’s the salt concentration that’s the greatest risk factor for high blood pressure, not the amount of salt one eats or how salty the food is \n\nIt’s how much salt goes up in the blood.\nFor example, if someone drinks a lot of water and so the salt concentration doesn’t go up, then the effect of salt to raise blood pressure is blunted\nHe did a study in humans where they gave salty soup with or without water\n\nPublished in the Journal of Clinical Hypertension in 2018, Acute effects of salt on blood pressure are mediated by serum osmolality\n\n\nIf enough water was given to prevent the salt concentration from going up, this could prevent the rise in blood pressure\n\n\nSalt increases the salt concentration in the blood, and that activates the osmol pathway\nWhen salt is given to animals that cannot metabolize fructose, he finds that they eat the same amount of salt, they get that salt, concentration goes up in their blood the same, but they don’t gain weight, they don’t become obese, and they don’t become hypertensive\n\n“So this hypertension and that left ventricular hypertrophy and all these things that are happening, are driven a lot by the conversion of glucose to fructose in the body from the salt” – Rick Johnson\n\nSo the salt and sugar work together, and then it’s what they’re doing to actually drive the blood pressure response and obesity\n\n \nThe role of vasopressin in metabolic disease [1:54:00]\nVasopressin signaling through the V1b receptor drives obesity\n\nNow interestingly, when salt concentrations go up in the blood, so does vasopressin\n\nAnd vasopressin is a hormone that’s produced in the brain that helps to conserve water\n\n\nWhen one eats salt, or sugar, vasopressin levels go up in the blood \n\nFructose induces vasopressin gene expression, Published in the Journal of Neurophysiology in 2017, Role of fructose and fructokinase in acute dehydration-induced vasopressin gene expression and secretion in mice\nThe ability of salt to raise blood pressure depends on an increase in serum osmolality, Published in the Journal of Clinical Hypertension in 2018, Acute effects of salt on blood pressure are mediated by serum osmolality\n\n\nAnd the vasopressin released from the brain goes up in the blood and it helps hold onto water to try to help the body conserve water\nBut Rick has recently found that the vasopressin is also helping the fructose to drive fat\nWhen one eats fructose or salt, the fructose that’s produced from the salt stimulates vasopressin, and the vasopressin binds to a specific receptor called the V1b receptor\n\nIt’s the V1b receptor that is actually important in driving obesity\nIf this receptor is blocked, this can block the effects of sugar to cause obesity, metabolic syndrome and so forth\n\nHydration also blocks these effects by limiting an increase in serum osmolality\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16745\"

out the different vasopressin receptors\n\nPublished in JCI Insight in 2021, Vasopressin mediates fructose-induced metabolic syndrome by activating the V1b receptor\nOne of these receptors is a vasopressin receptor called 1b (V1b receptor), and no one knows what the function of that receptor is\nWhen this receptor is blocked, they had a remarkable finding— the animals could eat all the sugar they want, or they could eat salt, but they won’t get obese because the obesity pathway is driven through that receptor\n\nExactly how the receptor works, he don’t fully know\n\n\n\n\nThe V1b receptor stimulates a hormone called ACTH that stimulates cortisol steroids\n\nIt also stimulates the islets to produce glucagon, which counters the effects of insulin\nAnd it also works to upregulate the fructose pathways in the liver\n\n\nThe V1b receptor is expressed in the central nervous system and also in the adrenal gland\n\nIt’s also expressed in the islet cells in the pancreas\nIn obesity, it seems to be expressed in the liver\n\n\n\nStudies in fructokinase knockout mice and V1b receptor knockout mice\n\nPeter asks how this effect compares to the fructokinase knockouts, “if you took the fructokinase knockout mice and compared it to the mouse that has normal fructokinase, but just has this receptor [V1b] blocked and you give them the same amount of fructose, glucose, salt, etc., which one is more resistant to the obese phenotype?”\nThe fructokinase knockout tends not to want to eat sugar; they tend to not like fructose\n\nOne has to kind of force them to eat the fructose\nBut even they are forced to eat the fructose, they’ll never get fat\n\n\n\n“The V1B receptor knockout (like the fructokinase knockout) they’ll eat a lot of sugar, they won’t get fat” – Rick Johnson\n\nPeter asks how they are disposing of the fructose they eat\nThey’re totally regulating total caloric intake\n\nSo although they eat more fructose, they eat less chow; so they maintain their energy balance\n\n\nHow do they not turn into skinny fat mice where their overall energy balance is fine, but because of the fructose they eat, they should get fatty liver disease and diabetes\n\nRick notes, “They do not get that. They don’t get fatty liver. They don’t get insulin resistant. They stay normal.” \n\n\nRemember that the metabolic syndrome was driven through the energy depletion pathway; the actual caloric pathway is still intact\n\nWhat we know is that it’s down regulating fructokinase; this is probably the key point\nThe V1B receptor knockout have less fructokinase; they’re turning it off; they’re reducing the amount\n\n\nNormally when you eat sugar, the fructokinase levels get higher and higher\n\nThey get turned on by sugar\n\n\nAnd the V1B knockout doesn’t do that; so the fructokinase stays at a low level\nRick’s guess is that some of the fructose is being metabolized by other enzymes, like glucose, glucokinase and stuff\nWhat happens is they eat normal amounts and they stay normal weight and they don’t develop metabolic syndrome, but they don’t turn up their fructokinase\n\nVasopressin stimulates fat synthesis to store water \n\nRick’s recent book, just released in February 2022, is Nature Wants Us To Be Fat \n\nThis goes into a lot of the stuff discussed in this podcast\nIt provides the next level of insight into fructose metabolism, uric acid, vasopressin, and the sequela that develops\n\n\nIn the vasopressin story, a very important finding is that when he studied the fructose survival pathway, he found that the fat produced was not just being used as a caloric source, but it was being used as a source for water\n\nBecause when fat is oxidized, it generates a ton of water (metabolic water)\n\n\nAnimals in the wild, when they store fat, they’re actually storing it not just for calories, but for water\nSo the hibernating bear will use the fat as a source of water while they’re hibernating\n\nWhile they’re storing fat, vasopressin levels are high\nBut vasopressin levels plummet during hibernation; that seems to allow them to burn the fat\nDuring hibernation, they are making some urine, but their bladders stay permeable and so they reabsorb some of their urine\n\nRick doesn’t think they’re making large amounts of urine; it’s probably because of the low metabolism\nBecause they drop their temperature and their body metabolism so they’re generating less urine \n\n\nBut their vasopressin levels typically are turned off during hibernation\n\n\nAnd animals in the desert often have fat in their tails or the camel has a hump, because they don’t want the fat on their body because that would increase the insulation and increase the body temperature\n\nBut they want to use the fat as a source of water\nThey live in these environments; they do have very high vasopressin levels\n\n\nThe big breakthrough was to realize that vasopressin is not just holding onto water by reducing the excretion (the volume of urine), but it’s also holding onto water by stimulating fat [synthesis]\n\nVasopressin stimulated fat synthesis through the V1b receptor\n\n\nThe V1b receptor increases cortisol\n\nHigh cortisol levels can lead to Cushing Syndrome, these individuals develop kind of metabolic syndrome\n\n\nThe V1b receptor also stimulates glucagon, which raises glucose\n\nThis counters some of the effects of insulin; it creates an insulin resistant state\n\n\nBut also because the fructokinase in the liver seems to increase in the setting where the V1B receptor is activated\nAnd that may help produce more energy depletion by increasing the enzyme [fructokinase], so that it can really metabolize the fructose as fast as it can\n\nRick thinks that is the mechanism \nAnd animals that have the V1B receptor knocked out, they like sugar, they like salt, but they cannot metabolize the fructose very well and they seem to be protected from obesity\n\n\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialRick’s latest book: Nature Wants Us to Be Fat: The Surprising Science Behind Why We Gain Weight and How We Can Prevent–and Reverse–It By Richard J.
