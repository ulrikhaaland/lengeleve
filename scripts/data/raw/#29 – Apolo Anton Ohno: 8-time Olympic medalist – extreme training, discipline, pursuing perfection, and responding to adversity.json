It doesn’t make sense how these human beings can be leaning over these impossible angles on a blade that’s one millimeter thick and they’re wearing outfits that resemble Superman without the cape.”\nPeter has noticed a common thread amongst professional in that they enjoy the process of mastery and the practice that comes with it\nDid Apolo enjoy practice? Not early on (age 14-17), but eventually did\n\nThe differences between inline and ice skating, and short- & long-track speed-skating, and the evolution of the clap skate [21:00]\n\nInline skating is on wheels (rollerblades), predominately outdoor but some indoor tracks now\nIce skating is, of course, on ice in a skating on a 17-18 inch blade\n\nShort track vs long track\n\nShort track, more recently invented, is a form of speed skating in which multiple skaters (4-6) skate around an oval track of 111.12 meters where the skaters are passing and battling\nLong track has been around much longer, skate around a 400 meter oval and it’s you against the clock, in your own lane\n\nEvolution of the ice skate\n\nClap skates started to make it into the sport 1995-97\nEvolved into a clap skate “so you get like a five to 15 percent additional advantage every single time you push”\nTotally different technique in how you skate and when the clap skate came out, many competitors fell out of the sport because they weren’t able to make the adjustment\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-30.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"418\" />\nFigure 2.

And for me I would say 80 percent of my career all my races were won before I got to the start line. The other competitors were racing for second [because] they just they just knew that I was like just completely off my rocker. I was not in the same headspace as them.”\nApolo’s early success in short-track that led to an amazing opportunity and his reluctance to go for it [40:15]\nEmergence of short-track speed skating\n\nSpeed skating was a demonstration sport in the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics\n1992 was the first Olympics to have it officially as an Olympic sport\nUS not a big player, no real funding for athletes\nShort track differs quite drastically from long track\n\nLong track is a 400 meter loop with a max of 2 skaters staying in their own lanes and racing against the clock\nShort track includes 5-8 racers competing in a group on an oval ice track with a length of 111.12 meters (364.6 ft), the rink itself is the same size as an Olympic-sized figure skating rink and an international-sized ice hockey rink\n\n\n\nA very technical sport\n\nSkaters have all the control over their equipment\nIf equipment (skates and blades specifically) are not completely dialed in you are at a severe disadvantage, very technical\nBlades are offset to the left side (because you’re always going left and always leaning left in the turns)\nNot actually digging in the ice, mostly gliding on the water on top of ice\n\nApolo emerges as a very talented youngster\n\nFrom 12-14 was winning all the races “west of Toronto”\nKnew he didn’t want to be a swimmer anymore\nEventually was recruited by a junior development program in Lake Placid, NY (Home of the 1980 Winter games where Heiden won 5 gold medals, and the Miracle on Ice occurred)\nThe program means you move to NY, go to school there, and train, supposed to be at least 15 but asked him to come early at 14\nHe lived in Seattle at the time (summer of 1996)\nApolo didn’t want to go, just a naive kid who wanted to hang out with his friends and didn’t realize the opportunity in front of him\nApolo’s father thought that this singular-focus sport could really help Apolo, a mischievous kid, put his high energy and tendency to get into trouble to good use\n\nApolo’s brief run-away from home\n\nDad drops Apolo off at airport for his flight to Lake Placid\nInstead of boarding the flight, Apolo calls a friend to come pick him up and he proceeds to live with friends for the next 11 days\nProgram calls Apolo’s dad and says where is your son?\nDad finds Apolo and this time flies with him to Lake Placid and hand-delivers him to Coach Patrick Wentland\n\nEarly days at Lake Placid, first experience on the world stage, and a little self-sabotage [56:45]\nEarly days at Lake Placid\n\nHated it at first, awkward, didn’t fit in, athletes from all over the country\nOnly training he’d done before was with his dad who used to wake him early mornings to skate and used this approach to instill mental strength\nApolo, whose nickname was Chunky as a kid, had the highest body comp of the group in Lake Placid and this embarrassed him\nHe barely missed the cut to make the junior team (got 3rd place) which ticked him off as this was the first team he has ever not made in his life\nIt was a moment when he began to realize the limits of his natural talent, “That was a time where if I wanted to make significant changes I had to really concentrate both technically and also on the physiology of training to be a short track athlete.”\n\nPreparing for his first experience on the world stage\n\nIn preparation for the 1997 World Team trials to make the 1997 World Team, Apolo began putting in extra work in the weight room\nHe saw massive gains with relatively little effort and ended up winning the trials and qualifying for the World Team\nAt age 14, he was competing against grown men, placed 19th at the 1997 Speed Skating World Cup, and after witnessing the style and attitudes of the foreign teams (Korea, China) came away with the impression that the US was way behind the times in terms of the training and skating strategy\n\nSelf-sabotage\n\nWith the approaching Olympic trials, Apolo fell back into old habits in Seattle, stopped training, ate crappy food, and lost interest in putting in the effort\nApolo still doesn’t fully understand why but theorizes that it has something to do with how easy things were for him with all his talent that he was looking for the minimum amount of work he could put in and still achieve success\nYoung, immature, and naive about how far talent could take you, “There’s a thousand guys in line who have half the talent that would do ten times more work just to be a fraction of what you could possibly become.”\n\nOlympic Trials in 1997 to make the 1998 Olympics\n\nApolo was just “going through the motions” in his training\nBarely made the cut for a chance just to compete in the Olympic trials\nAt the Olympic Trials, he didn’t get anywhere close to qualifying for the Olympics\nHad a defeated and defiant attitude\n\nTough love parenting, making a commitment, training like Rocky, and developing the mindset of a fighter [1:17:30]\nA cabin on the beach\n\nSeeing a pivotal moment approaching, Apolo’s father literally dropped Apolo off at a cabin on Moclips Beach (Iron Springs Resort) all by himself (at age 15!) and told him he couldn’t leave until he decided what he wanted to do\nAfter about nine days of contemplation and soul searching, Apolo made the decision to commit to speed skating\n\nTraining and tasting victory\n\nOver the next few months he trained in solitude in his father’s basement, didn’t talk to anyone, just trained and studied\nWhen he got back to the training center in Colorado Springs, he was by far the best skater in the national team program\nIn 1998, won a gold medal in the 1,000 meter at the Speed Skating World Cup against reigning Olympic champ Kim Dong-sung and also great talent, Fabio Carta (this event has very little meaning especially when it falls in the same year as a Winter Olympics)\n“I came out of nowhere and that became my first taste of winning on the world circuit”\n\nThe mental component of sports\n“The mental component of the sport was always to me the most fascinating and the most underutilized in every aspect.”\n\nEarly on he started working with a young sport psychologist (David Creswell) and together they worked on\n\nMeditation and breathing exercises\nPositive self-talk\nManifesting what you want through visualization\n\n\nApolo looked up to boxers and was a fan of the Rocky mentality\nHe would train until he puked for no other reason than to try to develop the mental toughness and fortitude\n\n“I thought that was the only way that I could beat the Koreans. . .I didn’t skate as beautifully as they did.”\n2002 Olympics, winning his first medal, and rising above the sport [1:32:45]\n<img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\"

I was ready.”\n\nHe held the best time trial of ~1:23:45 in the 1000 meter, nobody else breaking 1:25:00\nSimilar to Lance Armstrong, Apolo had low lactate levels which can be an advantage\n\nLactate test Apolo would perform:\n\n6 sets of 1000 meter sprints, 2 min rest in between sets\nPrick you each time to generate your lactate performance curve\nMaintained his lap time and speed, lactate stayed steady and low (says around 9, and others were at 20)\n\nStory about his first Olympic medal (and a must-watch satire video)\n<img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-32.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"514\" />\nFigure 4.

You can do everything right and for whatever reason something out of your control gets thrown your way and you have to take it as such and learn from it and come back stronger and better.”\n\nRising above the sport\n<img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-41.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"664\" height=\"877\" />\nFigure 6. Apolo Ohno Wheaties Box. Image credit: aloha_pineapple | Flickr\n\nAs is rarely the case, Apolo says less than 1%, he was a featured athlete which allowed him to earn a living through commercials and media tours\nMost medal-winning athletes have to get “regular jobs” while training in between Olympic games\nWhat made Apolo appealing?\nPeter and Apolo theorize that his story was just interesting and inspiring in a way\nAmericans love to win, but they love a story of overcoming hardship even more, and the way Apolo finished that first race for silver was a perfect fit to his fascinating life story\n\n“Obviously I want to win. I want to bring home bring home the color gold because that is what we signify with being successful. But at the end the day, I wanted the representation of who I was on the ice at that period of time to reflect what we would be proud of. And that would make my father proud. And I knew if I had that happen that I could be proud and that our country would be proud.”\nApolo’s evolving training and body composition throughout his Olympic career [2:05:15]\nYou would expect an athlete going from age 19 to 23 to 27 would put on muscle and gain weight, but Apolo actually continually got leaner and leaner (while maintaining strength)\n2002\n\nTraining was about power, ballistics, strength, and speed\n165 lbs\nExceptional ability was to recover quickly\nLeg press 1,500 lbs\n350 for 12 reps (max of about 500)\nVertical was 36 inches\nPeter says “I’m convinced by the way the single leg vertical is probably the best predictor of speed.”\n\n2006\n\n155 lbs\nCould still leg press the same weight\nSignificantly leaner\n2006 games he won a gold in the 500 meter and a bronze in the relay\n\n2010\n\n143 lbs\nLeg press nearly 2,000 lbs\nLess ballistic power\nStopped doing Olympic lifts\nDid a lot of weighted plyometrics\nSpent much of the time purposefully atrophying his upper body\n\n“In speed skating there’s seven parts to one push . . . that you have to drill and you had to make it automatic and normal. And you’re never on just one plane of balance on that piece of blade. You’re on the heel, now you’re in the middle, now you are back towards a heel and then you finish on the ball or towards the toe. And it’s different depending on the speed . . . and the track pattern. There’s so many elements that are always changing.”\nGoing into the Lion’s Den to learn from Korean skaters and making a radical and risky change that led to his most successful Olympic games [2:12:45]\nIn 2007, Apolo realized that to stay competitive he had to go into the “Lion’s Den” (as his father put it) and train with the best skaters in the world, the South Koreans\nCheck out this great NBC segment where Apolo describes how this time in South Korea changed his life\nApolo lived and trained in South Korea in 2007, during his time there he was struck by the following characteristics of the skaters:\n\nCommitment to perfection in their technique and preparation\nEfficiency in which they move on the ice which made their physical strength less important\nUniformity of the team who all seemed to skate the same\n\nHow they had so many great athletes\n\nGiant pool of skaters\nExtreme discipline from a young age\nBodies seemed to be genetically built for speed skating\n\nApolo realized he needed to make big changes to stay competitive\n“If I take the same strategy of success from 2006 into 2010, I won’t make the semi-final.”\n\nHis dominance in the sport was waning\nSouth Koreans were getting better and better\nThe sport was evolving and he needs to evolve with it\n“What was important during training the elements that made you a fast speed skater all changed. . .My goal was to show up as a different type of an athlete that they would never prepare for. I want to change my natural gait and rhythm.”\n\nRocky metaphor: Peter compares how Apolo totally changed his approach leading up to his final Olympics to how Rocky prepared for his rematch with Clubber Lang\nChanging his training and preparation from 2007-2010\n\nHired a live-in strength and conditioning coach\nBecame obsessively focused with losing weight, especially upper body weight/muscle that wasn’t necessary to have\nIt was a struggle, loved food, and not much weight to lose\nNeed to get lighter and faster so he worked on his gait: wanted to go from power and slow to quick and nimble and had to retrain his gait to a quicker cadence\nHad sticky notes around his house constantly reminding him of his goal\nHe was constantly questioning his decision => he was doing the opposite of what he did in the past which made him successful\nResults were not good at first, other skaters were doing better than him, and the chatter was that he was sticking around for one too many Olympics, but in the end it worked out\n\n“I was driven a lot by my pure fear that the guys on the other side of the world were better, more prepared, younger, more talented, and genetically-gifted. . .and the only way I knew was just to be tougher mentally and to be able to withstand a pain threshold that they wouldn’t even dare step into”\nApolo’s tumultuous relationship with South Korea, from hatred to respect to admiration [2:29:00]\n\nAfter the 2002 games where he won gold only because the Korean skater was disqualified, Apolo was hated across the country of South Korea\nApolo felt hurt emotionally because he loved the culture, and felt the hatred was unwarranted\nAnti-American sentiment was at its peak, and Apolo was a bit of a scapegoat\nThey even had Apolo’s face on toilet paper\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-42.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"622\" />\nFigure 7.
