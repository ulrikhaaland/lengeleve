  "content": "Check out more content with expert, Iñigo San Millán, Ph.D.:\n\n(December 23, 2019) Part I of II: Zone 2 Training and Metabolic Health\n(March 28, 2022) Part II of II: Deep dive back into Zone 2 Training\n\n\nIñigo San-Millán is an internationally renowned applied physiologist and a previous guest on The Drive. His research and clinical work focuses on exercise-related metabolism, metabolic health, diabetes, cancer metabolism, nutrition, sports performance, and critical care. In this episode, Iñigo describes how his work with Tour de France winner Tadej Pogačar has provided insights into the amazing potential of elite athletes from a performance and metabolic perspective. He speaks specifically about lactate levels, fat oxidation, how carbohydrates in food can affect our lactate and how equal lactate outputs between an athlete and a metabolically unhealthy individual can mean different things. Next, he discusses how Zone 2 training boosts mitochondrial function and impacts longevity. He explains the different metrics for assessing one’s Zone 2 threshold and describes the optimal dose, frequency, duration, and type of exercise for Zone 2. Additionally, he offers his thoughts on how to incorporate high intensity training (Zone 5) to optimize health, as well as the potential of metformin and NAD to boost mitochondrial health. Finally, he discusses insights he’s gathered from studying the mitochondria of long COVID patients in the ICU.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n<iframe title=\"201 - Deep dive back into Zone 2 Training | Iñigo San-Millán, Ph.D. &amp;

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

we not only re-broadcasted it, but we reached out to many of you for follow up questions in preparation for this episode\n\n\nWe begin the conversation around Iñigo’s work with 2-time Tour de France winner, Tadej Pogačar\n\nHis training \nWhat the best of the best in the world are capable of\nAnd how we can use that to benchmark ourselves\n\n\nWe discuss lactate levels, fat oxidation, the relationship between watts and lactate, how carbohydrates in food can affect our lactate\nThen we talk about how equal lactate outputs in an athlete and a metabolically unhealthy individual can mean different things and how to interpret that\nWe get into very specifics around Zone 2 exercise\n\nThis includes many of the questions people had around what metrics to use to know if you’re in Zone 2\nHow to structure an ideal Zone 2 training program without a lactate meter with regards to duration, timing, frequency\nThe importance of compounding the rate of improvement that can happen with Zone 2 training\n\n\nWe talk a lot about VO2 max and high intensity training\n\nWhere that fits in with overall Zone 2 training\nHow exercise can have such a large impact on longevity\n\n\nWe discuss Metformin and its potential impact on the mitochondria \nWe discuss claims that NAD can boost mitochondrial health\nWe end by discussing healthy versus unhealthy mitochondria\nWe speak about Iñigo’s study on long COVID patients, which revealed effects on the mitochondria that were reminiscent of type 2 diabetes\nAs a brief reminder of his background, Iñigo is an Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine\n\nHis area of research and clinical work focuses on: metabolism, nutrition, sports performance, over training, diabetes, cancer, and critical care\n\n\nHe’s also an internationally renowned applied physiologist\nHe has worked for the past 20 years with many professional athletes and teams around the world\n\nThis includes the 2 times tour de France winner Tadej Pogacar\n\n\n\n \nThe amazing potential of cyclist Tadej Pogačar [3:00]\nTadej Pogačar\n\nNo one knew who Tadej Pogačar was 2.5 years ago but now he may potentially go down as the greatest Tour de France cyclist of all time\n\nTo win the tour at such a young age (21)\nNot just win the yellow Jersey, but the white Jersey, and the polka-dot Jersey repeatedly, he looks like something of a different species almost\n\n\n\nIñigo’s work with Tadej Pogačar\n\nIñigo began working with Tadej Pogačar in late 2018 when he signed up for the the UAE team\n\nPogačar had just turned 19 \nIñigo recognized right away his potential\n\n\nPhysiological testing of Pogačar  revealed his amazing capabilities\n\nHis ability to clear lactate and put out a great amount of power for long periods of time\nIñigo measured his blood lactate levels at a given power output\n\nHe’s been doing this testing for 20 years with professional athletes, professional cyclists\nThis allows him to categorize people\n\n\nPogačar was at a different category in his first year as a pro cyclist\nHe could sustain a high amount of power with very low lactate compared to the rest \n\n\nIñigo uses TrainingPeaks software to track his ability to sustain a given power output for the whole day or a specific glycolytic effort\nIñigo saw his trainability, how easy he would get the concepts, how easy he would be comfortable with the training, how easy he would recover\nIñigo would talk to him once, twice a day using the WhatsApp\n\nHe would know when Pogačar had a hard week and Pogačar would often tell him he was good and recovering well\n\nWhere as other cyclists would have to take it easy after that week\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMetrics for assessing athletic performance in cyclists and how that impacts race strategy [8:30]\n\nAround this time, Iñigo began developing a platform for metabolomics with colleagues at the university, Angelo D’Alessandro and Travis Nemkov\nThey can look at hundreds, if not thousands of metabolites in the human body\nThey did this in the Tour of California in 2019, which was around April; Pogačar won\n\nSo he has the analysis of all of Pogačar’s metabolites\nPrior to this, they ran this analysis at the training camp in January, 2018\n\n\n\n“Wow, this guy has different metabolites at the glycolytic level, acidic level, recovery level…. this guy is different”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nOne of the most telling data points for a cyclist is lactate production (y-axis) versus watts per kilo (x-axis)\n\nA normal climbing tempo in the Tour de France is about 5 watts\nSomeone at that intensity might have already six millimoles (mmol) of lactate, where it would be 1 mmol at resting levels\nThis can predict how taxing the work is and really predicts performance\n\n\nIn the first training camp of the year for the team they do physiological testing and he gets this data \n\nThis allows him to rank the cyclists\nThey test this with different racing simulations; this measurement is very predictive\n\n\nPeter notes this is one thing he loves about cycling— knowing where the athletes stand before the race based on their FTP (functional threshold power) in watts per kilo\nPeter interviewed Lance Armstrong last year and Lance revealed when he was off EPO he could hold 450 watts for 30 minutes\n\nSo that would be slightly above FTP\nHe was around 70 to 75 kilos\nThis was in the ballpark of 6 watts per kilo\nBut on EPO it was 7.1 watts per kilo, a huge difference\n\n\nOnly the GC contenders could do that, ride at 6 watts per kilo\n\nBut there relatively few moments in the tour when one needs to sustain that level\nThese moments occur at the most important strategic times; this is where the race is won and lost\n\nBecause races are won and lost by minutes\n It takes about 4-5 hours per day for 23 days to complete the Tour de France; it’s about 100 hours in all\nYet the difference between the 1st, 2nd, 3rd guy will be, in some cases seconds, in some cases a few minutes\nFor someone to win by 5 minutes is considered a blowout\n\n\n\n\nIñigo uses this metric a lot\nKnowing the power output a ricker can sustain for specific times and climbed tells alot about his capabilities \n\nWhat distinguishes Tadej Pogačar from other cyclists? [13:00]\n\nFor Pogačar, in the Alps, he was riding at a very, very high level\nIñigo will observe the data that he has, the data he thinks the other ones have, and he will structure a strategy for the next day\n\nThis helps to answer questions like, “Hey, does he have the legs to attack?  Should be holding back or what should we doing?”\n\n\nHe knows when a rider is at so many many watts per kilo, for this many minutes, what his capacity is to recover\n\nHe has the physiological data and trends\nBut one has to be careful with the algorithms because there are days when the data says the cyclist should be in top form but the feel more fatigued\n\n\n\n \nThe impact of performance-enhancing drugs and the potential for transparency into athletes’ data during competition [17:00]\nFTP (functional threshold power)\n\nPeter notes that the current transparency in cycling that arose from the high octane era of cheating, we now know the numbers cyclists were putting out when they were assisted by EPO and blood transfusions\n\nThe best cyclists, using performance enhancing drugs, were putting out between 6.8-7.1 watts per kilo FTP \nCyclists today are not doing that\nA cyclist could probably win the tour today at 6.1 watts per kilo\n\n\nPeter asks, “Do you think that making that data public would put to rest a lot of the criticisms that say they’ve just found new ways to cheat, but it’s still basically a dirty sport?”\nIñigo thinks this is a good point\nIt frustrates him when people think that they’re doing 7 watts per kilogram, but the real data from the day and it says it was way lower\n\nOn the short climbs they may be at 7.2, now they’re doing 6.3 maybe\nThe longer climbs they’re doing 5.5, 5.8\n\n\n\nAthlete’s data\n\nTeam policy usually keeps this data private\nBut if the data is released, there will always be people who will not believe it or think the data is altered\n\n“I just have that frustration that I wish that I could really show the data and people can see it”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nSome teams and riders are releasing their data\n\nThis allows him to see where Pogačar is\n\n\nPeter remarks that one of the things the sport of Formula One has been able to do (because of advances in technology) is make more of the data available to the viewer\n\nYou can see the drivers speed, what gear he’s in, the difference between throttle and brake pressure\nYou can hear the driver speak with their race engineers\nThis year they introduced a new camera angle, which shows what the driver sees\n\n\nIñigo agrees this is fun for the viewer; cycling has so many possibilities to engage people fascinated with the physiology\n\nSome cameras already installed in the front and the back, this is available from Velon\n\nThis gives a sense of how difficult it is to sprint at 40 mph or descend at 70 mph\nYou can see power output in real time; it’s an estimation\nStats are only shown for the riders who wear the Velon\nThey aren’t doing all the top contenders, but it’s the first step\n\n\n\n\n\n“The world of biosensors is going to revolutionize sports where we’re going to be able to see so many different parameters of athletes in real time”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nImagine if you could see lactate and glucose in real time\n\nThis is technologically feasible\nThis would be great for all sports\nImagine in an NBA basketball game seeing the lactate of LeBron James as compared to the other players\n\n\n\n \nTadej Pogačar’s race strategy and mindset at the Tour de France [24:00]\n\nPeter asks about Ventoux in the Tour de France this year\nThis was probably Pogačar’s toughest stage\nIt was a very difficult climb and a very long climb; Pogačar’s mentality was wired like a champion\n\nHe knows the top of the climb is not the end of the stage\nIt has a very long descent\nHaving a big gap and knowing you have a big descent, and staying calm is an important strategy\n\n\nThe day before, 2 cyclists George Bennett and Sergio Higuita attacked in a short but very steep climb\n\nThere were maybe 12 riders left when they attacked\nThen there was a descent and a long highway all the way to the finish line; so there was plenty of time to catch up\nTadej didn’t follow them; he strategized that he had time and would take the chance on beating them tomorrow\nThese guys were caught 2-3 kilometers to the finish line\nSo all those 12 guys got together the next day, and Tadej eliminated them one by one\n\n\nThis is how Tadej thinks— no panic, plenty of time today, “Why am I going to go full gas when I know that he’s going to go full gas and he might lose energy for tomorrow because he might pay for this at this time of the tour de France and we have plenty of time to catch him up”\n\n \nDefining Zone 2, fat oxidation, and how they are measured [26:45]\nTadej’s training in zone 2\nPeter asks how much time Tadej spends in Zone 2; how does this change over the course of the year?\n\nIn the winter, 70-80% of the days he trains in Zone 2\nAs the season gets closer, he starts increasing the number of high intensity days\nWhen the racing season begins, there may be one stage race of 5-7 days then he will have a 5 day block (or 1 week) to recover before the next stage race\nHe alternates using different energy systems; each energy system has a time in the year where it is used in order to try to achieve certain goals\n\nA primer in Zone 2 training\n⇒ See the previous episode of The Drive with Inigo for more\n\nThe intensity of exercise is important to stress the mitochondria and oxidative capacity\nThis will recruit mainly type 1 muscle fibers\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16998\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/f1-inigo2-1024x643.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"643\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/f1-inigo2-1024x643.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/f1-inigo2-300x188.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/f1-inigo2-768x482.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/f1-inigo2.png 1506w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 1. Muscle fiber types.  Image source: Wikipedia\n\nThis is where you are mobilizing the highest amount of fat, both from adipose tissue as well from fat oxidation inside the mitochondria\nOxidative phosphorylation is the primary means of generating energy; this utilizes the mitochondria\n\nThe mitochondria is burning both fat and glucose \n\n\nZone 2 exercise intensity is the best at stimulating mitochondrial function and fat oxidation and lactate cleanse capacity \n\nLactate can be used as a fuel\n\nLactate is a great fuel for cells; it’s probably the preferred fuel for most cells in the body\n\nThis is work that George Brooks discovered; Iñigo would not be surprised if he wins the Nobel Prize\nIñigo has been translating a lot of his research\n\n\nLactate is oxidized in the mitochondria to produce energy\n\nThis requires MCTs (monocarboxylate transporters) to move the lactate from the cytoplasm of the cell into the mitochondria\nThis is stimulated with Zone 2 training\n\n\n\nZone 2 training is characterized by a high level of fat oxidation\n\nFat oxidation increases in Zone 2 training\nAs exercise intensity increases the fatmax starts to go down sharply\n\nWays fat oxidation can be measured:\n\nPeter notes that he can hook patients up to an indirect calorimeter\n\nThey wear a mask over their nose and mouth that has the ability to measure the amount of oxygen consumed using an O2 sensor\nO2 is coming in at 21% and whatever is exhaled is the difference between that\nThere is a similar sensor for CO2, so you know how much CO2 is produced\n\n\nHook the patient up to an ergometer (this could be a bike, treadmill, rowing machine, etc.)\n\nAs you increase the demand on the muscle you increase the wattage or speed\nThis allows VO2 and VCO2 (volume of O2 and CO2) and to be determined\n\nThese are usually measured in liters per minute (L/min)\n\n\n\n\nThe ratio of VO2 and VCO2 will tell how much energy is made from fat oxidation and how much of it is glycolytic\n\nThis can be converted to total grams of fat oxidation and a total grams of glucose oxidation per minute\n\n\nSo you then could plot on the y-axis fat oxidation and on the x-axis work (or power in watts) \n\nOxidation of fats and carbohydrates vary depending on exercise intensity [34:30]\n\nIn the 1920s Francis Benedict was one of the first ones who started to look into oxidation of fat and glucose\n\nThe indirect calorimetry machines were called metabolic cards\n\n\nAs exercise intensity increases, one needs more oxygen\n\nVO2 increases, and more CO2 is produced\n\n\nIn a lipolytic state, a more fatty oxygenation state, you still consume oxygen, but you do not produce as much CO2 \nIn a more glycolytic state, which occurs at higher exercise intensity\n\nYou’re recruiting the type II muscle fibers \nYou’re using more glucose for energy purposes, consuming more oxygen and producing more CO2 \n\n\nPlug in all these numbers into stoichiometric equations, and it will give you a profile of fat oxidation versus work (or power output) throughout the ramp state (a ramp test)\n\n \nUsing fat and carbohydrate utilization to calculate the mitochondrial function and metabolic flexibility [35:45]\nMetabolism of elite athletes compared to a recreational athlete, or someone with metabolic disease\n\nThis is where elite athletes like Pogačar have an amazing fat oxidation capacity compared to other competitive athletes \n\nThey have also characterized this in recreational athletes, or people with even type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and even with COVID patients\nThis reflects what’s happening in the mitochondria and how the mitochondria oxidizes those fuels at different exercise intensities\nFor example, at an intensity of 200 watts (W), an elite athlete does not use their glycolytic capacity as much a someone who is not well trained\n\nThe elite athlete can still recruit slow twitch muscle fibers and rely on fat to produce ATP because they have amazing mitochondrial function and are very efficient, metabolically speaking\n\n\nIn a recreational athlete, or someone who is sedentary, or someone with type 2 diabetes, you’re going to see mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction at 200 watts\n\nThey will fully rely on glucose because they cannot sustain that effort with fat oxidation alone\nThis will be reflected in the gas exchange, the CO2 and VO2 \n\n\n\n\n\nDetermining oxidation of fat and carbohydrates indicates mitochondrial function\n\nThis can be plotted to produce a metabolic map of fat oxidation and carbohydrate oxidation\nIn an indirect way, you can calculate the mitochondrial function and metabolic flexibility, to determine how fats and carbohydrates are utilized\n\nThis can allow you to determine training zones\nIñigo has been using this methodology for 16-17 years\n\n\nIñigo uses equations described by Frayn in 1983 to calculate fat oxidation and carbohydrate oxidation\n\nThese have been validated with stable isotope tracers (double labeled water)\n\n\nIn a study he’s going to publish soon, he has validated fat oxidation and carbohydrate oxidation directly with mitochondrial respiration.\nIn muscle biopsies, he has directly injected: fatty acids, pyruvate representative of carbohydrates, and glutamine representative of amino acids\n\nFrom this he can see that a very high correlation between this indirect methodology to look at mitochondrial function and the direct methodology, which is through muscle biopsy and injecting the substrate and seeing how it’s oxidized\n\n\n\n \nLactate levels and fat oxidation as it relates to Zone 2 exercise [40:00]\nAnalysis of cellular metabolism as exercise workload increases \nBlood lactate levels:\n\nThe change in blood lactate levels as workload increases can be used to define Zone 2 training\nPeter finds these 2 graphs (below) really powerful\n\nFrom Sports Medicine 2018, Assessment of Metabolic Flexibility by Means of Measuring Blood Lactate, Fat, and Carbohydrate Oxidation Responses to Exercise in Professional Endurance Athletes and Less-Fit Individuals \nThe independent variable here is the workload in watts (x-axis); that’s the metric that matters in cycling, which is he thinks the easiest way to do this test\nThis shows a progressive increase in workload as the wattage increases\nThe y-axis is the dependent variable; the first figure below follows blood lactate\n\nThe triangles represent individuals with metabolic syndrome (MtS); they have a resting lactate that is almost 2 millimole (mmol)\nThe squares represent a modestly trained athlete (MA)\nThe diamonds represent a professional athlete (PA)\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large

/>\nFigure 3.  Fat oxidation versus power in: professional athletes (PA), moderately active individuals (MA), and individuals with metabolic syndrome (MtS).  Image Credit: Sports Medicine 2018\n\nIñigo thinks resting blood lactate levels are going to be used more and more as a biomarker, like resting blood glucose levels\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes or profound metabolic syndrome their resting blood lactate levels are 1.5-3 mmol\n\nUsing blood lactate levels to define Zone 2 exercise in individuals with different levels of fitness\n\nPeter recalls their discussion of using a blood lactate level of about 2 mmol as a marker of the threshold for Zone 2 exercise\n\nIncreasing lactate beyond 2 mmol indicates movement from Zone 2 to Zone 3\n\n\nLooking at these date, the individual with metabolic syndrome is tapping out Zone 2 initially, any incremental workload placed on them takes them out of zone 2\n\nBy the time they’re at 100 watts, they’re already at the threshold of their Zone 2\n\n\nConversely, when you look at that medium trained individual (moderately active, healthy, squares in figure 1), they start out with a lactate of about 1, and it’s not really until they hit about 175 watts that they pass that inflection point where they move beyond Zone 2\nProfessional endurance athletes (represented by diamonds)start out at a lactate level of 0.5 mmol, and they stay relatively flat until they hit about 300 watts is when they finally cross over that threshold\n\nThis would normalize the data for weight\n\n\nPeter notes that as you move from left to right, the athletes get lighter; he would like to see the x-axis in watts per kilogram\n\nIñigo agrees, but this is what the reviews wanted; one review did not allow them to use watts/kg\n\n\nThe person with metabolic syndrome would be in Zone 2 at 1-1.3 watts/kg\nThe modestly trained individual is in Zone 2 at probably around 2-2.2 watts/kg \nThe professional athlete is in Zone 2 in the ballpark of 4 watts/kg\nPeter notes for his patients he aspires to see 3 watts/kg as an elite level of fitness\n\nAnalysis of fat oxidation changes as workload increases in individuals with different levels of fitness\n\nThe second figure looks at the same groups of individuals, the same independent variable (workload in watts, x-axis), but now the dependent variable is fat oxidation (y-axis)\n\nFat oxidation is easy to calculate via indirect calorimetry\n\n\n2 things stand out\n\n1) The fitter the individual, the higher their absolute capacity for fat oxidation\n2) A fit individual will actually increase fat oxidation to a local maxima before that oxidation begins to decline whereas most mortals begin at a maximum and decline from there\nWhy is this change in fat oxidation occurring?\n\n\nIñigo starts training at 1-1.5 watts/kg\n\nFor an elite athlete this is below resting level\nThey don’t need to use much fat for energy until they are pushed harder (2-3.5 watts/kg)\n\n\nIn people who are not very fit, starting above 1.5 watts/kg may be too much\nIf you started at 0.5 watts/kg, you might see a higher fat oxidation and the same phenomenon\n\n0.5 watts/kg is nothing; this is close to resting levels; one can maintain this for a long time\n\n\nIf you start at 2 or 1.5 watts/kg with someone who has significant metabolic dysregulation, you’re going to miss their fat max (maximum fat oxidation, fat max ox)\nFat max ox is occurring earlier than when blood lactate levels reach 2 mmol\n\nThis is true for everyone except those with metabolic syndrome, because their levels are so low\nThe moderately fit person hits their maximum fat oxidation at about 130 watts, but they’re hitting a lactate of 2 at 175 watts\nThe professional athlete is hitting maximum fat oxidation a little shy of 250 watts but they’re hitting 2 mmol of lactate closer to 300 watts\n\n\n\nRelating maximum fat oxidation to Zone 2 exercise \n\nPeter asks if Zone 2 should be redefined as the place where maximum fat oxidation occurs\nLooking at these 2 graphs, using a blood lactate level of 2 mmol might be too much\n\n\nIñigo agrees, this is what he has been learning all these years\n\nBlood lactate levels change between groups\nEverything is related to the lactate kinetics and lactate oxidation in the mitochondria\n\n\n\nRelating lactate levels to metabolic stress in individuals at different fitness levels\n\nPart of his doctoral thesis (published 20-some years ago) showed that the same blood lactate concentration in an elite athlete does not correspond to the same metabolic stress in a recreational athlete \n\n2 mmol lactate in elite athletes might be a higher metabolic stress than 2 mmol in a patient with metabolic syndrome\n\n\nA patient with metabolic syndrome can exercise for a couple hours with a blood lactate level of 2.5 mmol\n\nA professional athlete is going to be hurting at that lactate level\n\n\n4 mmol is the gold standard for lactate threshold\nPut a world class athlete and a recreational athlete at 4 mmol lactate and measure intensity and power output and ask who can maintain this output the longest\n\nIntuitively you would think it would be the world class athlete; it’s the opposite\nIñigo observed this 20 years ago\nRecreational athletes at the same blood lactate concentration would go about 30% longer because metabolically, it’s not as taxing for them as an elite athlete\nThe main reason is that the lactate measured in the blood reflects what is not oxidized by the mitochondria\n\n\n\nMetabolism of lactate\n\nWhen someone has high power output, they need a lot of glycolysis to provide that energy; this will produce lactate\nLactate is the mandatory obligatory byproduct, not waste product, but byproduct of glycolysis\nSo the higher the glycolysis, the higher the lactate\nLactate has 2 routes it can take\n\n1) Lactate can go from the fast twitch muscle fibers to the slow twitch muscle fibers\n\nThis is the lactate shadow that George Brooks discovered\nLactate is oxidized in the mitochondria of those slow twitch muscle fibers\n\n\nWhen someone has good lactate clearance capacity, they will be good at oxidizing it for fuel and will not use the 2nd route\n2) Lactate can be exported to the blood\n\nThis occurs when there is poor mitochondrial function\nWhen the ability of the mitochondria to take in and oxidize lactate is saturated, the lactate will be exported to the blood\nThis will be at a lower power output in less fit individuals\nThis is why looking at blood lactate levels in individuals at different fitness levels may not mean the same thing\nThe disparities are not huge\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow moderately active individuals should train to improve metabolic function and maximize mitochondrial performance [51:45]\nHow should the moderately active individual train to maximize mitochondrial performance? \n\nBased on these data, the moderately active individual hits 2 mmol lactate at 175 watts but max fat oxidation at 125 watts\n\nThat’s a 50 watt difference\n\n\nWhat should this person do to improve metabolic function, mitochondrial performance, fuel flexibility?\n\nShould Zone 2 be defined as 125 watts or 175 watts?\n\n\nIñigo advises going somewhere in the middle\n\nCompare blood lactate levels to fat oxidation as power output of exercise increased\n<img decoding=\"async\"

there are multiple theories about that\n\n\nWhen the lactate cannot be oxidized, it is exported to the blood\nThis is why people with poor mitochondrial function (people with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes) cannot oxidize lactate during exercise\n\nThe mitochondria in their slow twitch muscle fibers also don’t use fat; they rely on glucose\nThe moment they start using glucose, they produce lactate\nBut they cannot oxidize the lactate; this is why it is exported to the blood\n\n\nBy the time Pogačar saturates MCP1 and his mitochondrial capacity to oxidize lactate, he’s achieved a tremendous amount of power output\n\nThis is why a blood lactate level of 1 or 1.5 in a world class athlete doesn’t represent the same metabolic status as the same lactate level in a normal person\n\n\nBrooks and his team showed that well-trained athletes use more glucose\n\nYou cannot do 400 watts without a massive amount of carbohydrate oxidation\n\n\nIndirect calorimetry of recreational athletes or people with metabolic syndrome shows a maximum of 4 g/min carbohydrate oxidation\n\nElite athletes can get to 6.5 gram/ min; this is a massive amount of glucose oxidation\nAnd elite athletes will produce more lactate\n\nBut the key is, it doesn’t show up in the blood because it’s oxidized in the muscle\nThis correlates a lot with fat oxidation as well\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow the level of carbohydrate in the diet and ketogenic diets affects fuel utilization and power output during exercise [1:08:30]\nMetrics of cellular metabolism when on a ketogenic diet\n\n10 year ago, Peter was on a ketogenic diet for 3 years; it was at the end of that 3 year period when he got back into cycling\n\nThere there was about a 6 to 12 month period when was still in ketosis, and was getting back into cycling shape \nHe has 1 VO2 max test from that time\nThese data are interesting; he observed a maximum fat oxidation of 1.3 g/min\n\nThis occurred almost immediately\nIt was sustained until about 3.5 watts/kg; then it fell off and glucose became the dominant fuel source \nAt the time his FTP (functional threshold power) was about 4.1 watts/kg\nAt the end of the test his glucose oxidation was just under 6 g/min, about 24 KCAL/min\n\n\nPeter has seen this with another very fit cyclist who has been in ketosis for 7 years\n\nHis 20 minute FTP test was about 412 watts for 20 min\nThis guy could hold 1200 watts for 15 seconds; that’s good glycolytic power\nHis fat oxidation was 1.5 g/min\nThis made it confusing to define Zone 2 by maximum fat oxidation\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrics that define Zone 2 exercise should be adjusted for a ketogenic diet\n\nKetosis is an extreme example, but given how much the respiratory quotient (RQ; the ratio of VCO2 to VO2) depends on baseline carbohydrate intake— how do you adjust the definition of Zone 2\n\nPeter’s data would lead you to dramatically overestimate his mitochondrial efficiency \nHe doesn’t have lactate data from that test\nHis blood glucose was 4-5 mmol\n\n\nIñigo thinks there is an artifact in the metabolic card\n\nThe metabolic card measures gas exchange, and then through the equations it says, this person must be burning fat or burning carbohydrates\n\n\nAs you exercise, no matter what fuel you’re using, you keep increasing oxygen consumption\nBut if you don’t have much carbohydrates, you’re not going to produce much CO2 \n\nThis will mislead the stoichiometric equation because the algorithm is going to think you’re using a lot of oxygen and now producing enough CO2 \nInstead you’re going to be burning a lot of fat; that’s why you see fat oxidation north of 1 g/min\n\n\nIf you were to change your diet, 3 days later your fat oxidation might be 0.35\nThis is an artifact of the gas exchange\nSomeone in ketosis would have a maximum blood lactate of 2-3 mmol because simply they don’t have carbohydrates\nPeter would like to see this studied again, because if someone is only eating 50 g of glucose a day\n\nHow much glycogen are they making from the glycerol of all the fat that’s being converted to ketones?\nWhen Jeff Volek and Steve Finney looked at this, they put people into very strict ketosis and did muscle biopsies\n\nThey still saw 60% glycogen content in the muscle relative to what was there under high carb conditions\n\n\nPeter thinks his capacity to oxidize 5.5-6 g glucose/min was still there; it just took a long time to get there\n\n\nPeter asks, “is the VCO2 estimation off because of the stoichiometric coefficients, or do you think the VO2 estimation is also off?”\nNo, Iñigo doesn’t think the VO2 estimation is off; ketones are used very well for energy purposes\n\n \nGlutamine as a source for making glycogen—insights from studying the altered metabolism of ICU patients [1:15:00]\nGlutamine can be used as a fuel and to generate glucose\n\nThere is a 3rd element that is key in bioenergetics— glutamine\nGlutaminase it’s highly expressed and utilized; it converts the amino acid glutamine to glutamate (which can enter the Krebs cycle)\n\nIñigo has learned that from ICU patients\nICU patients are  a great model to study stress metabolism\nFor wound healing, ICU patients use about 3x more glucose at rest than what we have\n\nIt’s part of the healing process\n\n\n\n\nIñigo published a pilot study with ICU patients; they lack muscle glycogen\n\nPublished in Critical Care in 2015, Winning the war against ICU-acquired weakness: new innovations in nutrition and exercise physiology\n\n\nBy the time someone gets into the ICU they use 3x the glucose at rest\nAn athlete uses the same amount of glucose during high intensity exercise but for a reduced amount of time 2-4 hours\nFor someone in the ICU, they are using that amount of glucose 24/7\nEventually the body is going to run out of glycogen in the muscle; this will cause huge stress to the body\nGlutamine is another source of fuel\n\nIt directly enters the mitochondria and is oxidized\n\n\nThis is where cachexia come into play; every ICU patient becomes cachectic or suffers from muscle loss\n\nThis is the post ICU muscle wasting syndrome\n\n\nICU patients express tremendous levels of glutamine because they need it to either enter the Krebs cycle for energy or for gluconeogenesis\nICU patients also have hyperglycemia\n\nIn the acute ICU phase, they also have insulin resistance\nTheir hyperglycemia is off the charts\n\nThey are not going to get IVs of glucose\nThese patients benefit from receiving protein \n\n\n\n\nGiving them glutamine has been shown to increase survival\nThe question becomes, “where is this hyperglycemia coming from when you do not have glycogen?”\n\nIt is probably coming from protolysis (breakdown of protein) from muscles to release glutamine\n\n\nPeter asks about the hepatic glycogen stores of these patients\nThe liver is maintaining hyperglycemia; from an evolutionary perspective, you’d rather err on the side of hyperglycemia than hypoglycemia\nIñigo agrees; the liver is the source of gluconeogenesis\n\nHis hypothesis is that glutaminolysis is occurring in the muscle\n\n\n\n“Those muscles, they eat themselves to feed themselves or to feed the rest of the body”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nPeter reasons that exercising ICU patients, getting some load bearing resistance, would be important\n\nIñigo’s colleague Paul Wischmeyer (now at Duke University) is researching this\n\n\nIñigo thinks this hyperglycemia likely comes from gluconeogenesis\n\nThere could be a lot of glutamine released when you’re in a state of ketoacidosis as well\n\nEspecially in the first phase; we know that cortisol is very high at first\n\n\n\n\n2 main parameters in ICU patients that are predictors of mortality are\n\n1) High cortisol levels\n2) High lactate levels \nThese feel related; it’s a great model to understand stress metabolism\n\n\n\n \nHow exercise mobilizes glucose transporters—an important factor in diabetic patients [1:21:00]\n\nOnce you exercise, you have insulin resistance and difficulty translocating GLUT4 transporters to the surface of the muscle\n\nThese move glucose into the cell\n\n\nSkeletal muscle is probably the first tissue where diabetes starts because around 80% of the carbohydrates we have are oxidized in skeletal muscle\n\nPyruvate should be oxidized in the mitochondria\n\n\nBut with insulin resistance, GLUT4 transporters cannot be translocated\n\nBut there is a second way to move those transporters that not many people know about— that’s muscle contraction\nMuscle contraction is insulin-independent mechanism of translocating GLUT4 transporters to the cell surface\n\n\nGlucose uptake also seems to be heavily dependent on fitness\n\n“The fittest athletes require virtually no insulin to translocate glucose into the muscle, through the insulin independent pathway”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nInsulin also translocates GLUT4 transporters to the cell surface; and these transporters start bringing glucose inside\nHe has learned from people with type 1 diabetes, they should not inject themselves with insulin before exercise\n\nThis would result in 2 signals for translocating these receptors (insulin and muscle contraction), resulting in hypoglycemia\nExercise alone is enough to take care of the glucose\n\n\nThis can be applied to people who have insulin resistance (with pre-type 2 diabetes)— exercise right after you eat that carbohydrate\n\nThis will bring those transporters to the cell surface to move glucose into the cell\nYou are not going to need insulin\n\n\nPeter agrees and relates this to his own observations with lactate testing\n\nHe has tested his lactate every 30 minutes for a day\n\nYes, this is insane, expensive, and painful for your fingers\nBut it allowed him to learn how much a meal impacts blood lactate levels\n\n\nWhen he wakes in the morning, his resting lactate level varies\n\nHe’s tracked this for over 40 days; it ranges from 0.3 -1.1\nThe median level is around 0.8\nIñigo notes that in the neighborhood of 1 is normal for a fit individual \n\n\nNext he may eat a very high carb breakfast and go and do a Zone 2 ride or don’t eat anything at all and go and do a Zone 2 ride\n\nThis results in a very different lactate performance curve\nThe high carb meal raises lactate\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMetrics for finding Zone 2 threshold—lactate, heart rate, and more [1:25:00]\nMetrics for characterizing Zone 2 training\n\nIn a patient or a world class athlete you have the ability to do indirect calorimetry and lactate testing to determine Zone 2 training\n\nBut training normal people is different\nThe lactate measured in the blood is heavily influenced by production and clearance\n\n\nThe gold standard would be to measure fat oxidation\n\nBut even this can be confounded in people on a ketogenic diet\n\n\nWith patients, Peter will do a Zone 2 test based on their fat oxidation during an escalated VO2 max test\n\nFor example, their maximum fat oxidation may be 0.3 g/min, and this occurs at a wattage of 1.5 watts/kg\n\n\nHow should patients train to achieve Zone 2?\n\nThey won’t be able to train with indirect calorimetry\nSome people will have lactate meters and some people won’t\n\n\nWhat is a good surrogate for determining your training zone?\n\n\nIn this example, the patient oxidizes the most fat at a workload of 1.5 watts/kg \nPeter wants them to increase this to 2.5\n\nHow would Iñigo recommend they train?\n\nHe would start with a metabolic test; this information can provide watts, or speed, or heart rate (many people don’t have a power meter)\nPeter brings up another metric he uses with patients, RPE\n\nPeter misspeaks and defines this metric as “relative perceived exertion”, instead of “rating of perceived exertion”\nFrom his experience, he is in Zone 2 when his lactate levels are between 1.7-1.9 mmol\nHe can carry on a conversation but it’s not as comfortable\nIñigo agrees, exercising at a level where you can carry on a conversation and it feels a bit strained is a good surrogate for knowing you’re in Zone 2 \n\nYou will be just at that threshold of not being able to carry on a conversation\nThe person you’re talking to will know you are exercising\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use heart rate as a guide \n\nFor people who have not done a metabolic test, heart rate is a good guide\nFirst you need to determine your maximum heart rate (not the predicted maximum)\n\nFor Peter, he is in Zone 2 when he is working at 78-81% of his maximum heart rate\nFor less trained people, this % is lower\nHe tells patients to start at a broad range of 70-80% of their realized maximum heart rate\n\nThen make adjustments based on their rating of perceived exertion\n\n\n\n\nIñigo notes what your resting heart rate can tell you \n\nTake your heart rate when you first wake up\nFor example, if you’re normal heart rate is 50 and you’re a bit fatigued, you might wake up with a heart rate of 65\nThis ties into the concept of heart rate variability;  heart rate will vary from day to day\nWaking up with a higher heart rate is a red flag that you are fatigued\n\nSome people’s heart rate is not super sensitive to this but elite athletes are for sure\n\n\n\n\nSecondly, if your Zone 2  heart rate is 130, some days it  might be hard to get to that rate\n\nYou may be struggling at 110 beats per minute\nThis also falls into that concept of heart rate variability\nAthletes will see this; they can’t get their heart rate up on days they are fatigued\n\n\n\nAn experiment Peter did with medication to lower heart rate\n\nIf he takes a huge dose of a beta blocker, it takes all the gas out of his heart rate\n\nThis allows him to push harder and generate a higher Zone 2\nYou have to be careful if you have low blood pressure (like Peter), but propranolol is fine\n\nIt lowers the heart rate but not the blood pressure\n\n\nThis is not a pleasant experience but an interesting self experiment\n\n\nPeter’s Zone 2 is 2.75-2.85 watts/kg; he really wants to get over 3\n\nAt this level he is at the upper end of maximum heart rate, 81% maximum heart rate\n\n\nIf he takes 60 mg of time released propranolol, he is able to get over 3 watts/kg and his heart rate will only be at 68% of maximum\n\nBut it feels horrible; he feels like he’s going to die\nIt’s not pain, but it’s the worst feeling in the world\n\n\n\nHow fatigue and glycogen stores affect heart rate\n\nIñigo relates this to what you feel when you’re fatigued, when you don’t have enough fuel\nHe has experienced difficulty adjusting to exercise after a few days of intermittent fasting\nWhen you don’t have enough glycogen storages, it’s very possible that adrenal activity is decreased\nYou need to break down glycogen; this requires glycogen phosphorylase in the muscle and that’s directly regulated by catecholamines\nIñigo’s hypothesis is that when there is decreased glycogen stores, the brain says, “I don’t care about your legs, don’t use up all the glycogen because you have to give it to me”\n\nThe brain doesn’t shut down glycogen degradation, but it slows it down by releasing less catecholamines \nThe collateral effect of that is a lower heart rate; catecholamines also regulate heart contractility (they increase heart rate)\n\nSo a lower level of catecholamines results in a lower heart rate\n\n\n\n\nWhen he sees that an athlete’s heart rate is not going up as it usually would, he knows they have less glycogen stores\n\nSo he advises them to take an easy day or load up on carbohydrates\nThen see how responsive they are the following day\n9 times out of 10, they are back at their top level the next day\n\n\nThe brain uses about 100-125 g of glucose a day\n\nWhen your work involves a lot of thinking and stress, the brain might need a lot more glucose\nThis can be supplied by gluconeogenesis\nMuscles can also release glucose to be utilized by the brain as well\n\nGlycogen phosphorylase in the muscle will degrade glycogen to glucose and that can go into circulation to feed other organs\nThis requires glucose 6-phosphatase to release glucose from the cell (activity observed in skeletal muscles of mice followed by release of glucose)\nThis is small compared to what the liver is doing, but it’s possible\n\n\n\n\nIñigo has noticed that some days when he is stressed (not dieting) he feels dead when he goes out to exercise\n\nHe wonders what is going on\nHe notices that his heart rate doesn’t get up on those days\nMaybe you’re not overtrained but overworked\nOn days like this, he takes a day completely off\n\nHe sleeps  more\nHe increases his carbohydrate intake\nThe day after this, he feels like a million dollars and can even beat his PR (personal record)\n\n\n\n\nResting recovery is key for performance\nPeter agrees; he used to judge his performance by training load (not anymore)\n\nHe’s found that when he is doing too much work-wise, his performance suffers\nHe has to cut back on training to make time for more sleep or more relaxation\n\n\n\n \nOptimal Zone 2 training: dose, frequency, duration, and type of exercise [1:41:15]\nAdvice for the person new to Zone 2 training\n\nHigh intensity training is not enough\nMaybe someone new to this does some weights, plays some tennis, but they don’t really do any stead-state, sustained cardio (Zone 2)\nPeter asks Iñigo what training program he would recommend\n\n“You can accomplish very important mitochondrial adaptations and very important metabolic adaptations by exercising one hour”— Iñigo San-Millán\nDuration of exercise\n\nAim for 1 – 1.5 hour \nIñigo has measured adaptations that occur after training: fat oxidation, lactate clearance capacity\n\nBoth are surrogates of mitochondrial function\n\n\nIf you only train once a week, chances are your mitochondrial function will deteriorate over time, especially as you age\n\nHe sees this in body builders and high intensity exercisers— they have very poor mitochondrial function compared to people who do a little bit of everything\n\n\n2 days a week might maintain what you have\n\nIf you are new to an exercise program, this might not be enough\n\n\n3 days a week will start to show results\n4 days a week is ideal for sure\n5-6 days a week are ideal; but not everybody has 6 days a week to train\n\n4-5 days a week of training is achievable for most people\n\n\nPut aside 1-1.5 hours\n\n“Maybe Pogacar needs four hours, five hours to keeping increasing those huge mitochondria for a long time”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nFor a mere mortal, somebody just starting out who may not be fit, you can’t start off with 1 hour\n\nStart with 20, 30, or 40 minutes\nGradually build up to a 1 hour walk or run\n\n\nIf you bike, 1 hour 20 minutes or an hour and a half, 4 days a week is good\nFor patients just starting out, Peter is happy if they exercise 30 minutes, 3-4x a week\nPeter can’t do Zone 2 on the road; he uses a trainer\n\nIt’s hard to stay at a constant level on the road with starting and stopping, wind and hills, etc. \nIñigo agrees, the trainer is great, it isolates everything; if you can go 1 hour on the trainer\n\nHe likes to be outside\nBut on the trainer he will watch a movie or catch up on work— low-key activity\n\n\n\n\nFor people who haven’t done much, even 20-30 minutes might start producing results\n\nBut eventually this is not enough\nThe body will need longer training periods to boost mitochondrial function\n\n\n\n“If you can get to a goal of about an hour to an hour and a half, that should really work”— Iñigo San-Millán\nFrequency of Zone 2 training\n\n It’s also important to stimulate other energy systems like the glycolytic system\nPeople think that all elite athletes do is high intensity all the time and intervals; it’s the exact opposite\nThe workload is very similar in an elite athlete of any sport, whether it’s a triathlete or a cyclist or a marathon runner, or a swimmer\nThe majority of their exercise sessions are lower intensity\nWe cannot be so naive as to think that the best coaches and athletes in the world haven’t figured this out when they’re always trying new, cutting-edge things\n\nElite athletes spend hours and hours and hours of training to just improve a fraction of a second\n\n\nIncreasing glycolytic capacity and high intensity training are necessary but they are not what elite athletes do\n\n“The elite athletes have the best metabolic function of any human. Why not try to imitate their philosophy of exercise?”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nPeter asks Iñigo to compare 4 training regimens, each totaling 4 hours per week:\n\n1) 4, 60-minute sessions\n2) 1, 80-minute session and 3, shorter sessions\n3) 2, 2-hour sessions\n4) 1, 4-hours session\n\n\n#1 would be the best, 4, 60-minutes sessions has a higher frequency\n\nOf course if you have 3 hours on the weekend to add to this, go ahead\n\n\n\n \nHow to incorporate high intensity training (Zone 5) to increase VO2 max and optimize fitness [1:51:15]\n\nThere is a need for some high intensity too\n\nPeter’s 4 pillars of exercise\n\n1) Stability\n2) Strength\n3) Low-end aerobic, to improve mitochondrial efficiency\n4) High-end aerobic, for peak aerobic/ anaerobic performance\n\nPeter struggles the most with this one because when done right, it hurts the most\nIt’s also no longer relevant because he doesn’t compete in anything\nHe enjoyed this type of training when he was competing because he would see the rewards\n\n\n\nHigh intensity training\n\nFrom a lens of health, the data are unambiguous— VO2 max is highly correlated with longevity\n\nThere are not many variables that are more strongly correlated\nBut the levels don’t have to be that high\n\n\nPogačar’s VO2 max is probably 85\nPeter notes that for someone his age to be considered elite, in the top 2.5-2.7% of the population; this carries with is a 5x reduction in risk compared to the bottom 25% of the population\n\nThe VO2 max required here is 52-53 mL/min/kg\nPeter asks if this can be used as a gauge for how much high intensity training is needed? \n\n\nIñigo thinks more about bioenergetics energy systems\nLongevity is also highly related with mitochondrial function and metabolic health\n\n“There’s an aging process where we lose mitochondrial function, and there’s a sedentary component where we lose mitochondrial function”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nIñigo wishes there was a pill you could take to increase mitochondrial function, because it would increase metabolic health and longevity\nBut the only medication we know of is exercise\nDose and sustainability are important\n\nHigh intensity exercise is not sustainable\nVery extreme diets are not sustainable\nIf you combine both, it’s even worse\n\n\nHigh intensity training is important to improve glycolytic capacity\nWe lose glycolytic capacity as we age and it’s important to stimulate it\nPeter asks, if he has 1 additional training session per week, should he do a 5th session of Zone 2 training or a VO2 max protocol?\nFor VO2 max, high intensity training, Peter prescribes patients to do a 4×4 protocol\n\n4 minutes of the highest intensity, sustained exercise followed by 4 minutes of recovery\nRepeat this 4-6x\nAdd a warm up and cool down on either end and this will be a little over an hour\n\n\nIñigo recommends if you have a 5th day, do any type of high intensity session\nWhat he does on almost every Zone 2 sesion is at the end, he does a very high intensity interval\nIñigo does 1.5 hours of Zone 2, 4-5x a week (his typical routine)\n\nHe tries to do a good 5 minute, high intensity interval at the end\n\n\nIncreasing mitochondrial function takes months or years\nIncreasing the glycolytic system takes much less time, weeks or months\nIf you stimulate the glycolytic system 2-3 days you’ll see progress\nAdd a high intensity interval 2-3 days a week at the end of that Zone 2 training, and you’ll target both energy systems: the oxidative mitochondrial system and the glycolytic energy system\n\nIs zone 5 training okay to do immediately following zone 2 training?\n\nPeter asks if you blunt the benefit gained from Zone 2 training if you immediately follow it with Zone 5\nIñigo says no, because it’s done at the end, then exercise is over\n\nBut don’t do it in the reverse order because this will trigger all these hormonal responses and high blood lactate\nWe know lactate inhibits lipolysis\nSo if you have a high interval in the middle or the beginning and you don’t clear lactate very well\n\n\nAnother study Iñigo has under review shows that lactate at the autocrine level decreases the activity of CPT1 and CPT2 (needed for fatty acid transport into the mitochondria for oxidation)\n\nSo lactate interferes with the transport of fatty acids as well\n\n\nPeter is glad Iñigo raised this point because often patients will say, “I went out and did a two-hour ride today and it showed me that I spent 45 of those minutes, 45 of those 120 minutes were in Zone 2. So I did 45 minutes at Zone 2” \n\nThis is not the same as spending 45 minutes in dedicated Zone 2 training\nThere is a lot of up and down intensity\nThe average might be Zone 2, but you’re oscillating between Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 4, all the time\n\n\nIñigo has done lots of testing of himself, starting at age 15 but now he gauges his Zone 2 training by sensation\nHe is 50 now and is proud that he has the same metabolic parameters he had at age 40\n\nLactate, power, VO2\nHis VO2 is about 4 L/min\nWhen he was a cyclist his VO2 was about 4.5-4.8\n\nIt’s only decreases some which he’s really happy about because he’s not training like he did\nThis proves to him that doing this routine helps to maintain metabolic health (1.5 hours of Zone 2 exercise ending with 5 minutes of high intensity effort, 4-5x a week)\nHe’ll see what happens in the next 10 years\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCompounding benefits of Zone 2 exercise and how we can improve metabolic health into old age [2:01:45]\n\nIñigo has seen unbelievable improvement in people who just retired, in their 60’s, who now have time to exercise and sleep; they’re not overworked \n\n“It’s unbelievable and super inspiring how much they improve in their 60’s”— Iñigo San-Millán \n\nHe’s seen people in their 70’s with the metabolic parameters of active 30-year olds\nHe knows an 81-year old who is a world champion cyclist in the category of 80-85; he has metabolic parameters of someone in their 30’s\n\nHe was not a professional athlete in his 20’s or 30’s\nHe  was a hypertensive smoker who started cycling because he needed to change his lifestyle in his 40’s\n\n\nPeter takes away from the conversation the importance of compounding\nIñigo noted earlier the potential to make relatively quick changes in your glycolytic efficiency (to improve VO2 max)\n\nYou could see 50% improvement in a few months\n\n\nIt is very difficult to see a 50% improvement in mitochondrial function in a few months\n\nIt’s important to set realistic expectations\n\n\nWe should think of this level of training the same way as accumulating wealth\n\nIt’s day in and day out\nSmall compounded gains over years, and years, and years\nThis is why a 40-year-old overweight smoker can become a world champion cyclist at 80 because he probably never once again got out of shape in that 40 years\n\n\nIñigo notes it’s incredibly inspiring to see people in their 60’s, just retired, do their first test then come back 1 year later\n\nThey feel as strong as they did in their 30’s\nThey’re not taking medication, they’re in a good state of mid\nThey’re eating in moderation, a little bit of everything\n\n\nWe thought for years that everything is downhill after 40, but you can really change\n\n“You can really take ownership of that and improve it at any age”— Iñigo San-Millán\n \nThe effects of metformin, NAD, and supplements on mitochondrial function [2:05:15]\nEffect of metformin on mitochondrial function and blood lactate levels\n\nPeter asks if Iñigo has any insights into whether metformin impairs mitochondrial function\n\nStudies are ongoing to see if the impairment of mitochondrial function or elevated lactate levels seen in patients taking metformin is an artifact of the drug or is a real effect\n\n\nIñigo agrees that more research on this topic is needed\nMetformin seems to work for pre-diabetic patients and those with first-stage diabetes\nWe know that metformin inhibits complex I, which is key for mitochondrial function\n\nIt’s part of the electron transport chain \n\n\nHe will see someone showing up with a lactate of 3.5 mmol at rest and the first thing he asks is if they are taking metformin; many times the answer is yes\n\nHe thinks elevated lactate levels are an artifact of taking metformin\n\n\nPeter notes that patients taking metformin, their fat oxidation is suppressed because when they undergo metabolic testing, it show a very, very low level of fat oxidation\n\nSo their blood lactate levels don’t really speak to what is happening in the mitochondria\n\n\nIñigo notes that people aren’t taking metformin as a medication for longevity (or for general health); they’re already clinical patients\n\nThese people already have mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction\nSo it’s difficult to discern the effect of metformin on their mitochondria\n\n\nThis question could be answered with muscle biopsies to assess mitochondrial function\n\nDo any supplements increase mitochondrial function?\n\nPeter asks what other supplements might improve mitochondrial function\n\nPrecursors to NAD are common (NR or NMN)\n\nAre these clinically relevant?\n\n\nIf you boost NAD in the plasma, is it boosted in the cell?  Is it beneficial to the mitochondria?\n\n\nIñigo doesn’t think we have the answer and we need to be cautious about how we interpret the data\n\n“If you look at so many metabolites at the cellular level and mitochondrial level, they’re downregulated with aging”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nThe question is why are these metabolites downregulated?  \nIs the mitochondria per se downregulated with age?\n\nTherefore it doesn’t need as much NAD and other metabolites? \n\n\nNAD is very important in glycolysis; it is needed to maintain redox status\n\nNAD is utilized to convert glycerol-3-phosphate → 2,3-phosphoglycerate\nWhen NAD is depleted the only thing that rescues it is lactate \n\n\nIs taking NAD going to increase longevity? Iñigo doesn’t think so\n\n“Because longevity is not just one supplement or two or three or four or five. It’s a compendium on incredible amount of things that happen at the cellular level.”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nHe doesn’t think 1 supplement will do this\nRemember when everybody thought resveratrol was the thing for longevity?\n\nStudies in mice showed in increased longevity by 50%\nA lot of people started to take in resveratrol when they were 50, and they’re dead now\nIt doesn’t increase longevity in humans\n\n\n\nCould supplements favor the metabolism of cancer cells?\n\nPeter asks if there is a scenario where too much NAD could be harmful\n\nIn cancer patients, if you doubled their NAD levels, wouldn’t this favor the tumor’s metabolism?\n\n\nIñigo has done this pilot study in mice; he has done a lot of research on cancer metabolism\nWe know glycolysis is key in cancer cells and NAD is absolutely indispensable for that\nIñigo had done a pilot study in a few mice (it’s not published yet) where mice were given triple-negative breast cancer tumors; they tested 2 groups (4 mice each)\n\nThese tumors grow very, very fast\n1) One group got plain water\n2) The other group got nicotinamide riboside (NR, a NAD precursor)\n\nYou cannot take NAD, you can only take a precursor\n\n\nThey observed tumor growth for 23 days\nThey saw a 15% increase in tumor growth in the NAD group\nThey have statistical significance even with only 4 mice in each group; the results were consistent \n\nHe would love to follow this up using more mice\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe role of lactate and exercise in cancer [2:13:30]\n\nIt just occurred to Peter earlier when they discussed the mitochondrial slide that lactate released from cells could feed a tumor\nIñigo’s work on cancer metabolism is looking at this\nLactate regulates genetic expression of the most important genes in breast cancer\n\nHe has now found this is true in lung cancer too\n\n\nLacate is a mandatory byproduct of glycolysis\nIn 1923 Warburg characterized a high rate of glycolysis in cancer cells\n\nWhat struct Warburg was not the amount of glucose used but the production of lactate\n\n\nIñigo’s work is showing that lactate is an oncometabolite\nWhen there is a high glycolytic rate in cells, they will produce a lot of lactate\n\n“You cannot clear that lactate, it’s going to drive cell growth and proliferation as we’re seeing”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nHe is doing studies to block lactate production through genetic engineering  as well as DCA (dichloroacetic acid)\n\nWhen lactate production is stopped, they see proliferation stop within hours\n\n\nPeter notes, “exercise would increase your capacity for clearing lactate in the long term, but in the short term raises lactate. So it begs the question, in a cancer patient specifically, what’s the net impact of exercise?”\nThis is something Iñigo and George Brooks are working on\n\nBrooks has shown that the acute response to lactate is to increase the expression of 600+ genes\nAll these genes are involved in cellular homeostasis and in the benefits of exercise\n\n\nLactate is a stimulating molecule\nWe know about the effects of acute exposure to lactate from exercise; cancer is different\n\nIn cancer the lactate keeps accumulating; exposure is chronic\nLactate is responsible for the acidic microenvironment of the tumor\nThe more acidic the tumor the more metastatic it is, the more aggressive, the more glycolytic\n\nThe question is— why is that lactate accumulating?\nCan exercise counteract this?\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of exercise\n\nExercise might be beneficial for many patients\nHow does exercise affect exosomes released by cancer cells?\n\nExosomes are microvesicles in the body that may be responsible for metastasis\n\n\nAnother publication he’s working on is looking at the protein content and microarray nodes of exosomes released by breast cancer cells and lung cancer cells\n\nThis is providing incredible information to understand cancer metastasis\n\n\nOn the other side, muscles also release exosomes\n\nOne of the benefits of exercise is the crosstalk between skeletal muscle and many organs\nCould this be mediated through exosomes released by muscles?\nCould exosomes released by muscle cells keep cancer at bay?\n\nHe doesn’t know yet\n\n\n\n\n\n“We’re suspecting that we’re scratching the surface of something that potentially could be very interesting thing, to understand better the effects of exercise”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nPeter notes, “the deeper I go in the rabbit hole, into all things that relate to longevity, the more convinced I am that if you’re going to rank order things, if you were forced to rank order things, there’s nothing that ranks above exercise, as the single most potent tool or agent we have to impact longevity. And yet paradoxically, in the acute setting, exercise seems to do everything incorrectly.”\nThe chronic impact of exercise is undeniable geroprotective\n\n \nHow assessing metabolic parameters in long COVID patients provides insights into this disease [2:19:00]\n\nIñigo just published a study of metabolic parameters of patients with long COVID\n\nPublished in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine in 2022, Decreased Fatty Acid Oxidation and Altered Lactate Production during Exercise in Patients with Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome\n\n\nHe observed that mitochondria in long COVID patients (even in those who were previously healthy) look like those from people with type 2 diabetes\n\nIn terms of fat oxidation and lactate production\n\n\nThis study took place in the National Jewish Hospital; it competes with the Mayo Clinic as the #1 pulmonology hospital in the US\nPeople with long COVID struggle to breathe during simple tasks such as walking up stairs\nA test of their pulmonary function looks normal\nCOVID affects cardiac muscles so their cardio function was measured; this too is normal\nNext they undergo CPET testing, this is physiological, metabolic testing\n\nThey measure lactate as well\n\n\nThis study looked at 50 individuals; 25 of them previously had underlying conditions but the other 25 were normal people\n\nMost of these normal people were moderately active\n\nSome were doing marathons or triathlons\n\n\nThe average age was 50\n\n\nIñigo got the raw data from their metabolic tests and looked at fat oxidation and lactate production as a surrogate for metabolic function, metabolic flexibility, and mitochondrial function\n\nHe was shocked, because they were significantly worse than people with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome\nThis could explain why these people cannot go up the stairs where as before they were doing marathons\n\n\n\nPotential mechanisms of decline in metabolic health and mitochondrial function\n\nWe know that viruses can hijack the mitochondria for their own benefit, for reproduction— could COVID do the same thing?\nThere are people with long COVID that improve in weeks or months; they go back to normal\nBut, there are a handful of people who after a year, have not improved one bit\nCan exercise be used in a therapeutic way to stimulate mitochondrial function\nPeter notes that myocarditis occurs in some COVID infections; the rate is 2.3 cases of myocarditis per 100,000 people infected with COVID\n\nMost cases of myocarditis are transient, they recover; but some are not\nMyocarditis is inflammation of the cardiac muscle that results in depressed ejection fraction\nHe clarifies that what Iñigo is studying in these long COVID patients is distinct from myocarditis\n\nWhat Iñigo is describing is a global insult to the mitochondria in skeletal muscle\n\n\n\n\nIñigo agrees; the data (though indirect, lactate measurements) point toward mitochondrial dysfunction\nThe next step is to obtain biopsies for analysis\nIt could also be a microperfusion problem with the capillaries\n\nMicrothrombosis may prevent perfusion and result in increased lactate levels\n\n\nBut we know that other viruses can hijack the mitochondria and disrupt it\nMitochondria can interfere with viral fission and fusion processes\nMost of the time, this disruption of mitochondrial function by viruses subsides\n\nAnd mitochondrial function is restored shortly after the symptoms are gone\nWhy is this virus different?\n\n\nMost of these patients had a mild course of COVID; they were not hospitalized; they were not in the ICU\n\nThis work was done primarily on patients infected with the original variant and Delta (from June 2020 – April 2021)\nThere were 35 females and 15 males; so more females\n\n\nLong COVID may be a rare event, but when millions of people are infected, if it occurs 1 in 1 million— there will be a lot of people who need help\n\n \nThe advantages of using cellular surrogates of metabolism instead of VO2 max for prescribing exercise [2:25:45]\nLimitations of using VO2 max as a metric\n\nHow predictable is the relationship between Zone 2 as defined by maximum fat oxidation compared to VO2 max?\nSo if you run somebody through a CPET (cardiopulmonary exercise test) and figure out that their VO2 max is 4 L— how predictably can you say at X percent of that, you will be at maximum fat oxidation? \nIñigo has a manuscript in preparation with 225 subjects where they look at the relationship between fat oxidation and VO2 \nHistorically, research studies with exercise have been based on VO2 max\n\nFor example, patients were exercising for 6 months at 60% of their VO2 max\nPeter asks if this means 60% of the heart rate that produced VO2 max or 60% of the power that is their max power at VO2 max\nIñigo agrees that studies are not consistent with this metric\n\n\nIñigo looked at the cardiorespiratory adaptations and cellular adaptations to exercise\n\nHe wanted to know how well they correspond\nAthletes can improve tremendously at the cellular level but not at all at the cardiorespiratory level (at least based on VO2 max)\nConsider this example— an athlete who used to be an average professional with a VO2 max of 72.3 becomes a very good professional in 2 years\n\nHis VO2 max remained the same but his lactate levels were incredibly better\nAt a workload of  5 watts/kg his lactate was at 5 mmol 2 years ago but is now 1.7 mmol\nThe magic happened at the cellular level for this athlete\n\n\n\n\nThe VO2 max of an elite athlete does not come close to predicting performance\nVO2 max corresponds with fitness in the same way that watts corresponds with fitness\n\nThis implies that instead of using VO2 max to look at longevity and fitness, a power test (or a speed test on a treadmill) can be used; they will show the same thing\nIndividuals who are not active and have poor fitness, have a lower VO2 max and a lower power output\n\nThey have lower speed and lower lactate capacity\n\n\n\n\nVO2 max had been used as a great surrogate for fitness forever; Iñigo wants to see if it’s really that specific\n\nExercise at a specific % VO2 max does not tell you anything about a person’s metabolic state\n\nIn this study, people with the same VO2 max might be in different metabolic states\n\nSome are oxidizing a lot more fat or carbohydrates\nThis means VO2 max does not correspond to the same metabolic status\nPeter thought that most people would be metabolizing mostly carbohydrates by the time they are at their VO2 max\n\n\nIñigo notes that a sedentary individual at 75% of their VO2 max, might be around 3 mmol\n\nWhereas a world class athlete at 75% VO2 max, is about 1.5 mmol \nSo metabolically, they’re different but they are at the same VO2 max \n\n\n\n“So, if we prescribe exercise based on VO2 max, we might not do things correctly”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nIf you look at carbohydrate oxidation in these same individuals, working at 75% VO2 max\n\nA sedentary individual oxidizes about 2 g/min\nAn elite athlete oxidizes about 3 g/min\nThis is also different when they work at 50% VO2 max\n\n\nLongitudinally carbohydrate oxidation and VO2 correspond very well\n\nThe same is true for fat oxidation\n\n\nBut if you look at the lactate levels of individuals in the same group, lactate and VO2 max don’t correlate\n\nThe correlation (R2) values are sometimes 0.2 or 0.1 or 0.3\n\n\nOver the last few decades, Iñigo has learned about improving metabolism at the cellular level \nIf you want to be precise about prescribing exercise, use cellular surrogates such as lactate levels and fat oxidation is better than VO2 max\n\nUsing METs (metabolic equivalents of task) is prehistoric\n\n\nPeter notes that declining mitochondrial function is a hallmark of aging\n\nHe explains to patients that Zone 2 exercise is a way to measure mitochondrial function\nZone 2 exercise is both the treatment and the test\nNow we know there is even more to look at on the cellular level\n\n\n\n \nMetabolomics reveals how cellular metabolism is altered in sedentary individuals [2:33:45]\nWhat do biopsies tell us about mitochondrial function in sedentary individuals?\n\nThere is a lot of research that shows the difference at the cellular level between people with type 2 diabetes (or metabolic syndrome) and active individuals, or even sedentary individuals\nIñigo compared sedentary individuals with moderately active individuals; they looked at the mitochondria\n\nIn sedentary individuals there is a decreased capacity of the mitochondria to oxidize fuels (pyruvate, fatty acids, and amino acids)\nThere is also a significant decreases in the complexes that make up the electron transport chain\nThere is decreased capacity of the transporters that move different metabolites into the mitochondria\nThe transporter for pyruvate into the mitochondria is also dysregulated in sedentary individuals (as compared to active individuals)\n\nSimilarly, oxidation of pyruvate in the mitochondria is dysregulated\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the implications of these findings?\n\nThese people don’t have diabetes or prediabetes or clinical symptoms\nBut sedentary people are being used as the model to compare with unhealthy individuals\nThese sedentary individuals don’t have downregulation of GLUT4 transporters or abnormal glucose tolerance tests\n\n\n\n“I’ve been pushing for years that the model should not be the healthy, sedentary individual”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nAs humans, we are meant to walk or exercise, so the sedentary individual needs an intervention\nIñigo had a hard time getting an IRB to use active people as the gold standard in his studies\n\nWhat happens to glucose once it is inside the cell in sedentary individuals?\n\nIñigo unpublished studies show a disruption in the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) disrupts entry of pyruvate into the mitochondria\nMost diabetes research has focused on the peripheral level\n\nLooking at glucose levels, GLUT4 on the surface of the cell, insulin resistance, how much insulin the pancreas is releasing, etc. \n\n\nIñigo is studying the fate of glucose once it enters the cell\n\nDoes it enter the mitochondria?\nIs it reduced to lactate?\nThis can be used as a metric for dysregulation of glucose metabolism before patients have clinical symptoms\nDysregulation of glucose metabolism in sedentary individuals may occur 10-15 years ahead of clinical symptoms (such as insulin resistance)\n\n\nIñigo is studying the same thing with transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria\n\nHe’s measuring the levels of fat transporters (CPT1 and CPT2) in the mitochondria in sedentary individuals\n\nThese are also significantly downregulated\nSo in sedentary individuals, fatty acids will not be transported well into the mitochondria (where they can be oxidized)\n\n\nIf he injects fatty acids into the mitochondria, he finds they are not oxidized well either\n\n\nAt a cellular level, there are significant differences in the metabolism of fuels (glucose and fatty acids) in sedentary people compared to moderately active people\n\n \nCellular changes in the metabolism of people with diabetes and metabolic syndrome [2:39:15]\nMetabolism of intramuscular fat\n\nPeople with diabetes/ metabolic syndrome have intramuscular triglycerides\n\nThese are fat droplets\nThis fat is not metabolically active, yet it continues to grow in size\n\n\nElite athletes also have intramuscular triglycerides but they are very active\n\n25-30% of the fat oxidation comes from that fat droplet\nThis is probably a evolutionary mechanism to not rely on adipose tissue\nPerhaps it is a quicker source of fatty acids for fuel\nThese fat droplets are constantly being turned over, oxidized and replenished\n\n\nIñigo’s colleague at the University of Colorado, Brian Bergman, is working to characterize the content of these fat droplets\n\nOne thing they know is these fat droplets are very high in ceramides and diglycerides\nCeramides are key in the athelosclerotic process;they are a hallmark of cardiovascular disease \n\nHistorically it has been shown that ceramides are released from the liver\nNow he is seeing that ceramides are in intramuscular triglycerides\n\n\n\n\n\n“Could this be a connection between cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes?”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nThese intramuscular fat droplets in people with type 2 diabetes keep growing and they release proinflammatory molecules\nIñigo is working to establish the connections between type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at the mitochondrial level \nWe know that about 80% of people with type 2 diabetes also have cardiovascular disease (and vice versa), which is why it is called cardiometabolic disease\n\n“Could the nexus of all that be a mitochondrial impairment?”— Iñigo San-Millán\n\nPeter comments, he’s going to need to do a 3rd podcast in a couple years when all of this data is published\n\nThere’s going to be a lot more questions to be answered\n\n\n\n§Selected Links / Related
