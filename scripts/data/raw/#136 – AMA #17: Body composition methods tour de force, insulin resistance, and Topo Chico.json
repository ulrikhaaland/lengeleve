  "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter and Bob discuss different methods to evaluate body composition. They explore ways of measuring body fat, delineating between subcutaneous and visceral fat, and go over best strategies for improving body composition and optimizing health. They also discuss insulin resistance using a patient case study that highlights interventions capable of reversing the condition. Finally, Peter addresses his level of concern about a recent Consumer Report finding that Topo Chico had the highest levels of a class of synthetic chemicals (PFAS) of all the carbonated bottled waters tested. Peter concludes by sharing if the finding will change his consumption habits. \nIf you’re not a subscriber and listening on a podcast player, you’ll only be able to hear a preview of the AMA.

Especially Dixon methods, that produce co-registered water and fat images, facilitate the separation of both adipose and lean tissue compartments. [West et al., 2018]\nHow it works: Exposure to a large magnetic field changes alignment of atomic nuclei. Use of radio-frequency waves allows detection of this alignment change and can be used to reconstruct tissue orientation based on concentration of a particular element, typically hydrogen.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14531\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Peter-entering-the-MRI-machine-ama17-1024x960.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Peter-entering-the-MRI-machine-ama17-1024x960.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Peter-entering-the-MRI-machine-ama17-300x281.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Peter-entering-the-MRI-machine-ama17-768x720.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Peter-entering-the-MRI-machine-ama17.png 1048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 1.

Pros and cons of the MRI method.\n \nThe different types of body fat [9:00]\n“Not all fat is created equal.”\nSubcutaneous fat = fat between the skin and the fascia \n\nThe inability to see the six-pack of abs is really an issue of either too small rectus abdominis muscle group and/or too much subcutaneous fat surrounding the rectus abdominis muscles\n\nVisceral fat = fat beneath the fascia near the vital organs\n\nFascia is the corset that is holding you together—it’s beneath your muscles and inside the fascia is where your organs exist\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14527\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fascia-ama17-1024x610.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"610\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fascia-ama17-1024x610.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fascia-ama17-300x179.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fascia-ama17-768x458.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fascia-ama17-1536x915.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fascia-ama17-2048x1221.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 3. Image showing abdominal wall fascia. Image credit: earthslab.com\n\nVisceral fat is found around the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, and the gut. \nVisceral fat is incredibly associated with metabolic disease\nIn an ideal world, rather than tracking our BF%, we would instead track what % of our fat was visceral fat\nAlthough there are no standard reference ranges for visceral fat, in healthy individuals, values are generally less than 1 kg for younger individuals and between 1-2 kg for older individuals. (source, source, source) However, these cohort study approximations. \n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14535\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/visceral-fat-ama17.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"822\" height=\"673\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/visceral-fat-ama17.png 822w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/visceral-fat-ama17-300x246.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/visceral-fat-ama17-768x629.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" />\nFigure 4.

Based on differentiation of tissues by density, this reconstruction can be used to quantify fat content. Fat content of a specific body region can then be used to estimate total fat mass.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14537\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CT-scan-ama17-1024x680.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CT-scan-ama17-1024x680.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CT-scan-ama17-300x199.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CT-scan-ama17-768x510.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CT-scan-ama17.png 1166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 5. CT scanner.

Pros and cons of the CT scan method.\n \nMethods of assessing body fat—Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) [14:30]\nDual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) Overview:\n\nProcedure: The subject lies on a DEXA unit for a partial or full-body scan.\nHow it works: Similar to computed tomography, DEXA uses X-ray transmission to reconstruct tissue orientation based on density. However, DEXA is designed to use a much lower level of radiation.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14526\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dexa-scanner-ama17-1024x772.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"772\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dexa-scanner-ama17-1024x772.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dexa-scanner-ama17-300x226.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dexa-scanner-ama17-768x579.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dexa-scanner-ama17.png 1364w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 7.

Image credit: wikipedia.org\nMore detail:\n\nDEXA is the method Peter uses with most of his patients\nIt’s very quick x-ray—you lay on a table and a “wand” basically goes over you from head to toe to head \nMuch lower ionizing radiation than a CT scan \nYou get an assessment of bone mineral density and you get an assessment of lean mass and non-lean mass\nIt works by collecting electrons on the backside of you— the more electrons that get collected, the less dense the tissue that it’s been passed through.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14532\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/radiation-exposure-ama17-1024x767.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"767\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/radiation-exposure-ama17-1024x767.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/radiation-exposure-ama17-300x225.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/radiation-exposure-ama17-768x575.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/radiation-exposure-ama17-1536x1151.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/radiation-exposure-ama17-2048x1534.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 8. Effective doses of radiation from cancer screening procedures and other sources.\nMore advantages of DEXA:\n\nYou can differentiate between between the subcutaneous and intra abdominal fat to some degree (though not nearly as accurately as CT and MRI)\nVery quick and relatively inexpensive (about $150)\nVery trivial amount of radiation—the radiation from one DEXA scan is roughly equivalent to (or even less than) one coast to coast flight\n\nImportant thing to know: Your hydration level impacts the measurement so always try to do your DEXA scan in the same manner (same hydration level, same time of day, same sleep, same food eaten prior, etc.)\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14518\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pros-and-cons-DEXA-ama17-1024x373.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"373\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pros-and-cons-DEXA-ama17-1024x373.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pros-and-cons-DEXA-ama17-300x109.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pros-and-cons-DEXA-ama17-768x280.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pros-and-cons-DEXA-ama17-1536x559.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pros-and-cons-DEXA-ama17.png 1582w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 9. Pros and cons of the DEXA method.\n*Bonus advantage: Ability to measure bone mineral density\n\nPeter really likes to know bone mineral density (especially in my female patients)\nWe see osteopenia in women more than men—especially as women start to get closer to menopause\nSo, if your 35 and you’re trending toward osteopenia that’s a wake-up call \nAre we not getting enough impact? Are we missing some essential mineral? \nThe best thing you can typically do with the BMD is to stop the rate of decline.\n\n \nMethods of assessing body fat—Hydrostatic/Underwater Weighing [19:25]\nOverview\n\nProcedure: The subject sits on a chair or platform connected to a scale, fully exhales, and is completely submerged under water.\nHow it works: Based on Archimedes’ principle, the amount of water displaced represents the subject’s body volume. Thus, the underwater weight and the amount of water displaced allow for calculation of body density. Based on assumed constants for bone density and fat density, body density can be entered into an equation to estimate body fat percentage.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14534\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/underwater-weighing-ama17.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/underwater-weighing-ama17.png 400w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/underwater-weighing-ama17-256x300.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" />\nFigure 10. Illustration of measurement of underwater body weight. Image credit: dapa-toolkit.mrc.ac.uk\nMore detail:\n\nPeter’s preferred method before he switched over to Dexa \nThe problem with hydrostatic weight is you have to have a belief about what the end title volume is—\n\nYou have to have a very clear belief about how much air a person can expel from their lungs because that’s the point at which you’re weighing them. So the weight that you’re capturing of the person underwater is their weight when they have fully, fully, fully relieved themselves of as much air as possible but that’s not all the air. \nBut an individual that can’t tap into that will artificially have a higher looking body fat\n\n\n“I’m not a huge fan of hydrostatic.

Electronics in the chamber detect the change in air pressure, which is used to estimate volume. The chamber is typically connected to a computer, allowing for body fat percentage to be automatically estimated based on the collected data.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14524\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/air-pod-ama17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"557\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/air-pod-ama17.jpg 557w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/air-pod-ama17-300x217.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px\" />\nFigure 12.

Weight loss or muscle gain?\nPeter and Bob both agree that in this particular patient they would prefer that person focus on adding lean muscle vs. strictly trying to lose weight\nAnd if they were losing weight, it’s very important they protect the muscle they do have\n\nBenefits to adding muscle:\n\nFirst, muscle is more metabolically active so in the long run it’s going to help you\nSecondly, the structural benefits alone are essential if you’re interested in longevity\nAlso, weight bearing training (e.g., squats) can add bone mineral density\n\n***\nRob Lustig pointed out the four things being measured when you step on a scale:\n\nLean mass (part of which is muscle) — more is better\nBone mass — more is better\nSubcutaneous fat — Rob would say more is better (or at least not bad)\nVisceral fat — the lower the better\n\nNote: Although there are no standard reference ranges for visceral fat, in healthy individuals, values are generally less than 1 kg for younger individuals and between 1-2 kg for older individuals. (source, source, source) However, these cohort study approximations.\nThe upshot: Understanding what your body weight is composed of is much better than just your overall weight\n \nDefining insulin resistance and the steps to reverse it [40:15]\nDefining insulin resistance, and is it reversible?\n\nInsulin resistance is hyperinsulinemia in the presence (or absence) of hyperglycemia\nInsulin resistance is when cells become resistant to the effects of insulin—specifically the muscles and the liver\nSo when someone is insulin resistant… \n\nWill have high blood sugar after consuming carbohydrates because their muscles don’t take in glucose inefficiently because they aren’t able to respond to the signal of insulin\nThey’ll also likely have high levels of glucose in the morning because overnight their liver continues to make too much glucose and isn’t responding to the signal of insulin telling them to stop making it\nIf even they do NOT have high glucose in the morning, they may have high insulin—which is just a precursor to the high glucose\n\n\nIn practice, Peter could learn more specifics about a patient by performing an OGTT \n\nSee AMA #15 for patient case studies involving OGTT testing\n\n\nSo is insulin resistance reversible? The answer is yes, almost always.\n\nWays to reverse insulin resistance\nInsulin resistance can be combated with all 5 tools in the toolkit: \n\n1) Pharmacologic agents \n2) stress/cortisol management \n3) sleep strategies  \n4) exercise, and \n5) nutrition\n\n1.Pharmacological agents—Drugs that lower glucose\n\nPeter very much prefers drugs that lower glucose: metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists\nPeter is not a fan of diabetic drugs that tell the body to rev up insulin production as a way to overcome the resistance\n\n“I like the drugs that tend to lower glucose. So you can think of this as an input or an output problem. I much prefer to go after the input.”\n2. Stress/cortisol management\n\nWhen you’re under stress (physiologic or psychological), you’re producing cortisol and that’s going to exacerbate insulin resistance\nStress (i.e., hypercortisolemia) can be addressed pharmacologically and therapeutically (e.g., psychotherapy and/or meditation)\n\n⇒ Patient example: \n\nPeter had a patient who was dialed in on basically everything but metabolically he wasn’t responding\nThis patient had never dealt with a very traumatic event in her life\nAnd it was only when attention was finally turned to really dealing with that with psychotherapy and the correct pharmacotherapy that all the other metabolic things got in place\nThis patient was discussed in the episode of The Drive with Paul Conti\n\n“There’s a clear mind/body connection that is not just some sort of touchy-feely nonsense. It’s completely and it can’t be discounted.” \n3. Sleep\n\nSleep is probably one of the most overlooked ways to address insulin resistance\nResearch shows pretty clearly how much you can destroy glucose disposal by interrupting sleep\nExperiments show that when deprive people down to 4 hours per night for a period of two weeks there’s an incredible deterioration in insulin signaling and glucose disposal\nFrom this, you can imagine that more spread out/chronic forms of sleep deprivation could have devastating effects on insulin resistance\n\n“Making sure that you’re getting the right amount of quality sleep is a wildly important part of this and it’s something we focus on obsessively.” \n4. Exercise\n\nExercise allows you to increase the size of the reservoir that takes in glucose—the reservoir being the muscle\nZone 2 “cardio”—\n\nImproves both the insulin-dependent, and non-insulin-dependent, delivery mechanisms \nZone 2 exercise is training right at that maximum efficiency of mitochondrial performance and really improves insulin sensitivity\n*See episodes discussing zone 2 training — Iñigo San Millán and AMA #12 \n\n\nStrength training: This improves insulin sensitivity and improves the reservoir—the capacity—because your skeletal muscles are the greatest reservoir that you have for glucose disposal\n\n“Skeletal muscles are the greatest reservoir that you have for glucose disposal.”\n5. Nutrition\n\nBy definition, insulin resistance is a carbohydrate tolerance disorder\nAny doctor who is clinically taking care of patients will say insulin resistance patients generally respond better to carbohydrate restriction than any other form of restriction\nThey respond very well to calorie restriction by definition typically includes carbohydrate restriction\nIt doesn’t have to be a ketogenic diet \nRather than tell everyone to stay under XXX amount of carbs, Peter sets a standard in terms of average blood glucose and a standard deviation from that average\nPeter uses a Dexcom CGM to monitor this (see podcast episode with Kevin Sayer, CEO of Dexcom)\n\n“As those numbers start to come down and the insulin starts to come down and all these other things start to go, that’s exactly what reversibility looks like.” \n \nPatient case study: Reversing insulin resistance [49:00]\nPatient X\n\nMale\n35 years old\n5’10” and 192 lbs\nVisually, he does not appear to be overweight (though patient desired to be leaner)\nDate of initial testing: 11/17/16\n\nBlood panel – “Classic pattern of insulin resistance”\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14528\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Patient-X-lipids-ama17-1024x551.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Patient-X-lipids-ama17-1024x551.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Patient-X-lipids-ama17-300x161.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Patient-X-lipids-ama17-768x413.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Patient-X-lipids-ama17-1536x826.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Patient-X-lipids-ama17.png 1640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 20.

This was not like some overnight change, but truthfully I think within a year he had most of those benefits and he’s maintained them.”\n \nAddressing the Consumer Report finding that Topo Chico has high levels of PFAS [58:25]\nSee Peter’s recent email about a Consumer Report indicating Topo Chico had the highest amount of PFOA than any other bottled water \n***\nA recent Consumer Report looked at a chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in a number of bottled waters and it found there were more in Topo Chico than any other bottled water that they checked\n\nTopo Chico had 9.76 parts per trillion\nThis number is about twice the upper limit of what at least one organization had designated as the most you should see in bottled water\nThough it was far below what the EPA believes is harmful \n\nNext, let’s examine 1) the strength of the evidence that suggests that at those levels are harmful, and 2) How should one potentially modify behavior?\n\nFor Peter it came down to a precautionary principle and some principles around asymmetry:\n\n“If I used to drink two or three Topo Chico’s a day I’ll probably drink one every other day now and continue to dig a little bit further into this literature”\n\nWhy make this change? Because the downside of being wrong and missing out on some Topo Chico is less than the downside of being wrong and finding out in 50 years that this amount of PFOA was really harmful\n\n\nThe counter-argument:\n\nGiven the ubiquity of Topo Chico and frankly, other beverages that have higher amounts of PFOAs in them, you’d think there’d be a bit of a signal beyond what we’re seeing \nWhen something is really bad it’s usually not subtle (e.g., smoking and lung cancer)\n“If the epidemiology doesn’t really find it, it’s probably not that big an issue”\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter ultimate decision: Continue drinking Topo Chico, but to a lesser degree, and also to diversify his bubbly waters\n⇒ Peter’s preferred alternative to Topo Chico: WaterLoo (flavor=Black Cherry)\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialHockey team that Mike Luit (Bob’s alias) played for: Hartford Whalers | (wikipedia.org) [2:15]\nPodcast episode discussing whole-body MRI scanning technology: #61 – Rajpaul Attariwala, M.D., Ph.D.: Cancer screening with full-body MRI scans and a seminar on the field of radiology | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [7:15]\nVisceral fat is incredibly associated with metabolic disease: Contribution of adipose tissue to health span and longevity (Huffman and Barzilai, 2010) [10:00]\nAstronauts’ exposure to radiation: How Much Radiation Are ISS Astronauts Exposed To? | (forbes.com) [13:45]\nRadiation exposure from one coast to coast flight across the US: Radiation and your health: Air travel | (cdc.gov) [17:45]\nRadiation from one DEXA scan: DEXA scans & Radiation | (measureup.com) [17:45]\nMortality risk begins to rise when body fat % gets into the 35-40% range: Relationship Among Body Fat Percentage, Body Mass Index, and All-Cause Mortality: A Cohort Study (Padwal et al., 2016) [31:45]\nStudy showing skeletal muscle mass was an independent predictor of mortality: Muscle Mass Index as a Predictor of Longevity in Older-Adults (Srikanthan and Karlamangla, 2014) [34:45]\nPodcast with Paul Conte when Peter gave the example of a patient who couldn’t improve her metabolic health until she dealt with a traumatic event from her past: #15 – Paul Conti, M.D.: trauma, suicide, community, and self-compassion | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [44:45]\nExperiment demonstrating how much you can destroy glucose disposal with sleep deprivation: Impact of sleep debt on metabolic and endocrine function (Spiegel et al., 1999) [45:30]\nPodcast episodes discussing zone 2 training: [46:15]\n\n#85 – Iñigo San Millán, Ph.D.: Mitochondria, exercise, and metabolic health | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com)\n#92 – AMA #12: Strategies for longevity (which don’t require a doctor) | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com)\n\nPodcast with Tom Dayspring which explains how ApoB particles would be elevated due to high levels of triglycerides needing to be trafficked: #129 – Tom Dayspring, M.D.: The latest insights into cardiovascular disease and lipidology | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [50:30]\nThe Mark Rippetoe program which Peter recommends to certain patients that includes heavy compound movements with progressive overload: Starting Strength | (startingstrength.com) [55:30]\nPeter’s recent email about PFOA in Topo Chico: Topo Chico | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [58:25]\nPeter’s favorite bubbly water: Topo Chico | (topochicousa.net) [58:25]\nThe DuPont case—A study of workers living near a DuPont Teflon plant found an association between PFOA exposure and two kinds of cancer as well as four other diseases: [59:15]\n\nPerfluorooctanoic acid | (wikipedia.org) \nPFOA and Cancer in a Highly Exposed Community: New Findings from the C8 Science Panel (Wendee Nicole, 2013)\n\nPeter’s second favorite bubbly water: Waterloo | (drinkwaterloo.com) [1:01:30]\n§People Mentioned\nMike Liut [1:45]\nRajpaul Attariwala [7:15]\nDr. Evil [22:20]\nLawrence Golding [25:00]\nRob Lustig [39:30]\nPaul Conti [44:45]\nTom Dayspring [50:30]\nEvander Holyfield [52:15]\nMark Rippetoe [55:30]\n\n§"
