  "content": "In this special episode of The Drive, we have pulled together a variety of clips from previous podcasts about exercise to help listeners understand this topic more deeply, as well as to identify previous episodes which may be of interest. In this episode, Peter discusses his framework for exercise, what he’s really optimizing for, and how to train today to be prepared for a good life at age 100. He describes the importance of strength and stability, and why deadlifting is an important tool to consider for longevity. Additionally, he details why training in zone 2 and zone 5 is important, gives a primer on VO2 max, and describes the most effective ways to engage in those types of exercise. Finally, Peter reveals his current exercise routine.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n<iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BSAX0KSNS_E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#206 - Exercising for longevity: strength, stability, zone 2, zone 5, and more\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#206 - Exercising for longevity: strength, stability, zone 2, zone 5, and more\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#206 - Exercising for longevity: strength, stability, zone 2, zone 5, and more\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nWhat is Peter optimizing for with his exercise?

[3:00]\nFrom episode #92 – AMA #12: Strategies for longevity (which don’t require a doctor); discussed from [30:30] – [33:45]\nPeter is looking at exercise through the lens of longevity, not performance\n\nThe difference is important\nIf your goal was to break 2 hours and 40 minutes on the Chicago Marathon next year, the training required would be totally different from that needed to maximize longevity\n\nLongevity is a very difficult performance goal\n\n\nWhen you start to look into the far recesses of amazing physical performance, training would be very specific for that\n\nThis is not what Peter is discussing\nTraining for this type of performance is generally not collinear with longevity and at times they can be outright orthogonal \n\nSo this is the difference between something being in-line with (collinear) or at-odds with (orthogonal)\n\n\n\n\nExceptional physical performances requires maximum cardiac output, just beneath VO2 max \n\nThis level of performance and training puts an amazing strain on the body\nWhile this is better than sitting on the couch all day, it is past the point of optimizing longevity returns\nThis comes at some longevity cost relative to training at a lower energy system\n\n\n\nWhy training for the “Centenarian Decathlon” is so important \n\nThis podcast is geared toward this “Centenarian Decathlon”\n\n“This is the idea of being the most kick-ass 90-year old possible”‒ Peter Attia\n\nThis is based on 2 energy systems:\n\n1 – Strength and stability\n2 – Low-end aerobic energy system (which is zone 2, we’ll talk about that in a moment) which is punctuated with brief bursts of zone 5\nThese energy systems matter because this is generally where life takes place\n\n\n\n“Life is zone 1, zone 2, and zone 5”‒ Peter Attia\n\nBy training in zone 2 and zone 5 (with much more focus on zone 2), we’re preparing metabolically and structurally for longevity\n\n \nPreparing for a good life at age 100: Training for the “Centenarian Decathlon” [6:00]\nFrom episode #50 – AMA #5: calcium scores, Centenarian Decathlon, exercise, muscle glycogen, keto, and more; discussed from [18:15] – [33:45]\nWhat does Peter wish he incorporated into his exercise at age 25 to be in this race for the gold medal in the “Centenarian Decathlon”?\n\nFor most people, a system of the body is going to fail first\n\nSome people die suddenly when their mind and body are fine; they are an exception to this discussion\nFor many people their mind fails first, cognition is taken from them and then eventually they die or their body breaks down\n\n\nFor most people, the decline of mind and body, and the burden of disease occurs as the body fails first\nThis prompted Peter to think about how to mitigate the decline / fail of the body\nHe engaged in backcasting (instead of forecasting), to think of what he wants to do when he is 100 and work backwards from that to determine what to do today at age 45 (or any age)\n\nHe borrowed the term backcasting from Annie Duke who wrote Thinking in Bets \nSee episode #60 with Annie Duke\n\n\nThis led to the question‒ What do I have to physically be able to do to be satisfied with my life at 100 years old? \nHe thought about how old his kids would be when he is 100, and how old will their kids be\n\nHe realized at this age, his grandkids will have kids\nWhen Peter is 100, he will likely have great-grandchildren that are between the ages of 1-8\n\n\n\nWhat will Peter want to be able to do at 100 to be happy?\n\nHe doesn’t want to be bedridden with disease\nHe wants to retain his cognitive faculties \nThere are lots of physical activities he want to be able to do\n\nShoot a bow and arrow\nExercise (he enjoys it)\n\n\nActivities of daily living are important\n\nThings he would want to do with his great-grandkids when they are 1, 3, 4, 5, etc.\nBe able to drop into a squat position and pick up a child that weighs 30 lbs\nBe able to get up off the floor using a single point of support, such as just 1 arm\nBe able to lift something that weighs 30 lbs over his head; this is about the weight of his carry-on suitcase\nBe able to get out of a pool without a ladder\nBe able to walk up 3 flights of stairs with 10 lbs of groceries in each hand\n\n\nHe made a list of 18 things‒ this became his centenarian decathlon (even though a decathlon is only 10 things)\nHe asked‒ What are physical tasks that will approximate the things he wants to be able to do for daily living at age 100? \n\nWhat exercises will be useful to prepare to do the things Peter wants to do at age 100?\n\nA 30 lb goblet squat can approximate picking up a 30-lb kid who comes running at you\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17954\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/f1-exerciseroundup-831x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"831\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/f1-exerciseroundup-831x1024.png 831w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/f1-exerciseroundup-244x300.png 244w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/f1-exerciseroundup-768x946.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/f1-exerciseroundup.png 966w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px\" />\nFigure 1.

some touch on more than 1\n\nThe goblet squat requires both strength and stability\nWalking up 3 flights of stairs with 10 lbs of groceries in each hand is on the threshold of aerobic/ anaerobic output and also requires strength\n\n\nStability is where most people first begin to fail\n\nThis begins around the time that children start school\n\n\nPeter has noticed that young children are so good at stability‒ the way they squat, the way they move is so natural\nThe field of dynamic neuromuscular stabilization is based on this principle that there are 13-14 movements that are innate to us\n\nBy the time we are about 1.5-years-old, we do them all perfectly\nThen it’s basically all downhill from there\n\n\nDecline of stability is accelerated by school, once you start sitting\n\nWe lose the ability to maintain tension through our pelvic floor and throughout our entire core\nThe core describing the: diaphragm, obliques, transversalis fascia, and the entire pelvic floor\n\n\n\nPeter recommends:\n\nSpend as much time as possible working on static stability then dynamic stability\n\nIncorporate these principles into what you are doing strength-wise\n\n\nAt the age of 25, you can do a lot of exercises incorrectly and get away with it\n\nBut correct form is very important in the long run \n\n\nPeter thinks he’s always squatted and deadlift somewhat incorrectly\n\nHe’s never fully engaged his pelvic floor doing those\nHe got away with doing those incorrectly for a long time but now realize the damage that has occurred as a result\n\n\n\nAn anecdote‒ Peter’s breathing squat routine from high school:\n\nIt’s an amazing routine, but he doesn’t know if he recommends it \nIn high school he lifted 6 days a week, 3 hours a day\nOnce a week they did a routine of breathing squats\n\nTake your best 10-rep weight (a weight that you would fail with at 10-reps), load it on your back and do a squat (1 rep)\nGo down and up at your normal cadence \nAt the top of the squat, you take 3 of the deepest breaths you can take \n\nEach breath taking 10 seconds for a total of 30 sec\nBreathe in for 5 sec, breathe out for 5 sec (x3)\n\n\nAfter taking these 3 deep breaths at the top of the squat, do another squat \nContinue this routine for a total of 20 reps\n\n\nThis set takes 10 minutes\nThe only thing Peter has done since that rivals this degree discomfort of is an airbike tabata \nPeter describes this squat routine, “as one of these knuckle-head things we got out of our bodybuilder magazines (powerlifting magazines), and the idea was that nothing would stimulate more strength and growth than that activity” \n\nIt worked\nOver the course of 1 year doing this, he added over 100 lbs to his squat\n\nAnd that was starting at a level where he was already pretty strong\n\n\n\n\nThis workout was so painful that he would start getting uptight the day before\nThis relates to “super slow” or slow training‒ lifting slow and accumulating time under tension ~90 seconds\n\nOn of the proponents of this is Doug McGuff who wrote Body by Science \n90 seconds feels like an eternity\nUntil you time yourself lifting, you don’t realize how little time is spent under tension\n\n\nPeter’s memory from this breathing squats workout is that his upper body hurt as much as his lower body\nThere are a lot of on-going centenarian studies (listed below) and Bob wonders how many of these centenarians could do this decathlon‒ none of them\n\nThe Einstein one in NY of Ashkenazi Jews‒ The Longevity Genes Project at Albert Einstein College of Medicine’s Institute for Aging Research\nThomas Perls study has an aggregate of different ethnicities [the New England Centenarian Study]\n\n\n\nPeter comments on anyone who is a centenarian today\n\nThis is an extreme statement, but Peter thinks that anyone who is a centenarian today lived this long because of their exceptional genes\n\nThey haven’t hacked their way there\nMost of them haven’t done anything different (better/ worse) than their peers\nOn average today’s centenarians tend to smoke more, exercise less, and eat worse than their peers\n\n\n\n“What we’re talking about (people our age) is… hacking our way to centenarians”‒ Peter Attia\n\nThis is very deliberate\nThis is a new model to force your way to become a centenarian and will require deliberate attention around what you mind and body are doing\n\n \nThe importance of preserving strength and muscle mass as we age [21:45]\nFrom episode #176 – AMA #27: The importance of muscle mass, strength, and cardiorespiratory fitness for longevity; discussed from [58:00] – [1:03:30]\nHow much lean mass are people losing over time?  What is aging robbing you of as time goes on?\n\nThe lowest rate of decline in lean mass (shown by studies) is 1-2% per year after age 50;

discussed from [42:00] – [51:00]\nHow has Peter’s thinking changed on deadlifts?\n\nLong before powerlifting was in vogue, Peter would lift weights every day with a friend in high school\n Powerlifting is different from olympic lifting, powerlifting is 3 lifts: the deadlift, the squat, and the bench press\nPeter grew up doing a lot of deadlift, squatting, and bench pressing\n\nHe was always horrible at the bench press\n\n\nIn 2016 Peter partially tore one of his obliques\nAfter this he was never able to deadlift again without some discomfort\n\nEven though it is a great total hip hinge, compound movement, he got away from doing deadlifts\n\n\nThis changed when he began Dynamic Neuromuscular Stimulation (DNS) in 2017/ 2018\nLearn more about DNS in these episodes of The Drive: \n\n#131 – Beth Lewis: The Art of Stability: Learning about pain, mitigating injury, and moving better through life \n#152 – Michael Rintala, D.C.: Principles of Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS) )\n\n\nThrough DNS Peter realized the deadlift was going to be beneficial because it becomes a beautiful audit for everything working perfectly\n\nPeter deadlifts at least twice a week (often 3x a week), both straight bar and trap bar; he doesn’t go that heavy\n\nIn terms of weight for deadlifts, Peter might have had 400 lbs on the trap bar in the past year\n\nHe usually stops at 350-375 on the trap bar\nOn the straight bar he goes lighter, maybe 185 lbs\n\n\nHe does a lot of slow eccentrics\nHe films every single rep of every set\n\nHe studies it and sends it to his coach, Beth Lewis\nHe works to make his deadlift perfect\n\n\n\n“I’d rather take a light weight and deadlift it perfectly several times per week”‒ Peter Attia\n\n His typical workout is 4-5 sets of 10 reps \n\nThese are not killing, crusher sets\nAt no point is he past his limit\n\n\nHe can push himself harder in other things\n\nPeter’s goal is to do the deadlift perfectly, and he is constantly checking his form \n\nDoes he have just the right amount of thoracic extension?\nDoes he have just the right curvature in the lumbar spine?\nDoes he activate his glutes? \nDoes he activate his hamstrings?\nIs he pulling back instead of pulling up?\nIs he wedging correctly?\n\n“All of this little stuff translates biomechanically to the activities of daily living that matter to me.  Like getting up off the floor, picking up one of my kids, lifting a piece of luggage, or something like that.”‒ Peter Attia\nIf he can do the deadlift and it feels right, then he knows he ready to do everything correctly\n\nWhen something doesn’t feel right during a deadlift, he knows\n\n1 – How to recognize that feeling\n2 – The steps to bo back and correct it\n\n\nPeter wants to put together a video on deadlift and preparation\n\nThere are about 10 exercises he does to get ready to deadlift; they don’t take long (10-15 minutes)\nHe’s not sure how much of the benefit is the actual deadlift versus all the things he does to do the deadlift correctly\n\n\nOnly recently did Peter realize you can deadlift in a way that puts your spine under traction\n\nThis is counterintuitive; you might think your spine is under compression when lifting under an axial load\nIt turns out when you learn the right positioning, then you can deadlift and actively create traction in the spine\n\nYou understand how to create intra-abdominal pressure\nYou know how to elongate your spine\n\n\nThis is why the deadlift is the most important thing Peter does before he gets on an airplane\n\nHe’s going to be sitting for 5-6 hours\nHe doesn’t want his spine to be compressed\nThe deadlift primes him to maintain that activated form of traction\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe importance of zone 2 aerobic training [35:45]\nFrom episode #103 – Looking back on the first 99 episodes: Strong Convictions, Loosely Held; discussed from [37:00] – [41:00]\n\nZone 2 training has been covered in a variety of episodes; this was most recently covered in the second podcast with Iñigo San-Millán\n\n#201 – Deep dive back into Zone 2 | Iñigo San-Millán, Ph.D. (Pt. 2)\n\n\nPeter spends 3-4 hours per week training in zone 2 and thinks it’s incredibly important for all of his patients\nYou want to put a rate-limiter on the intensity of your workout when you do zone 2 training\n\nHow has Peter’s thinking on zone 2 training changed?\n\nWhen Peter was a cyclist, he spent 10-12 hours a week training in zone 2\n\nNow he spends 3-4 hours per week in this zone\n\n\nIn late 2014 when Peter stopped competing in time trials, he stopped doing any low intensity training (which is a major component of training for competition)\nHe went from cycling to rowing and running\nHe was obsessed with being as efficient as possible; everything was an all-out effort\n\nIf he was running, it would be a 6-minute mile, not a 9-minute mile\n\n\nMeeting Iñigo and going through literature on zone 2 training before having him on the podcast brought to light the benefits of this type of training\n\nMetabolic benefits‒ insulin-dependent and insulin-independent glucose disposal\nImprovement of mitochondrial function, health, and density\nIncreased release of neurotrophic factors that can come from this type of activity, such as BDNF secretion\n\n\nPeter realized he needed to reincorporate zone 2 training into his exercise program\n\n“One of the things about zone 2 that I really enjoy is, it’s just not that hard… it’s just nice to get on the bike… and that’s my time to listen to podcasts and audiobooks”‒ Peter Attia\nTakeaway: We can do zone 2 our entire lives; we can do it safely, and it yields enormous dividends\n \nThe most effective ways to engage in zone 2 exercise [40:00]\nThe next clip is from episode #145 – AMA #19: Deep dive on Zone 2 training, magnesium supplementation, and how to engage with your doctor; discussed from  [14:00] – [18:30]\n\nThere is not a best device, but choose one where you can easily reproduce the same output\nPeter likes the bicycle because it has a clear metric that he can adjust‒ the wattage\n\nWatts are easy to track\nHe uses an ergometer; he puts his road bike on a device called a Wahoo KICKR which is hooked up to a computer where he sets the numbers of watts he wants and it adjusts the resistance \n\n\n\nPeter on his Wahoo KICKR explaining a zone 2 workout: \n\n\n\nOther devices can be good for zone 2 training\n\nHis wife likes to ride a Peloton (he doesn’t like it); she doesn’t got into a class but sets the resistance and the RPM she puts in, and it spits out a wattage\n\nSo she has to adjust her cadence to stay at a specific wattage\nIt’s the difference between in erg-mode and spin-mode\n\n\nShe also likes a rowing machine\n\nPeter is not fond of rowing for zone 2\nHe likes the rowing machine for zone 5, but that’s because he’s not a very good rower \nSomeone who has good form (like Beth Lewis, previously on the podcast) can get a good zone 2 workout on a rowing machine\n\n\nCycling is second nature for Peter; it’s a very efficient thing for him to do\nHe’s not fond of ellipticals because it’s hard to stay in the proper zone\n\nYou may have one that works for you, where you can get your heart rate high enough and move quick enough\nThe key is‒ how much energy do you have to put in to maintain a sustained dose? \nThe bike on the erg-mode of a trainer makes it easy; he doesn’t have to think about it; it’s putting 200 watts to his wheel no matter what he does in terms of speed\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the device, it’s the wattage that matters\nHe is also always measuring heart rate \nTreadmills are also a great way to do this\n\nFor most people though, running gets them out of zone 2 quickly\n He advises patients to do brisk, incline walking \n\nStart at a 10-15-degree incline at 2.5-3.0 miles per hour (maybe less)\nThis is empirical, you have to figure out what incline and speed will keep you in zone 2\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you know you’re in zone 2?\n\nTrack power output (watts), heart rate, and lactate\nPeter has noticed his heart rate will be elevated if he’s sick, dehydrated, or something\n\nIn this case back off; adjust the wattage down a bit\n\n\n\n \nZone 5 training and VO2 max [44:15]\nFrom episode #153 – AMA #21: Deep dive into olive oil, high-intensity exercise, book update, and more; discussed from [49:30] – [55:30]\n\nAnother pillar of Peter’s framework of exercise focuses on the upper end of aerobic, verging on anaerobic exercise (zone 5 training)\nZones are a function of the underlying system used to track exercise intensity\n\nThis could be heart rate-based training \nOr power-based training (following wattage output)\n\n\nPeter thinks of zone 5 as VO2 max training\n\nWe talk about VO2 max in AMA #27 and compare someone with low fitness (at the bottom 25% of VO2 max) to someone with elite fitness (at the top 2.5% VO2 max)\n\nThere is about a 5-fold difference in benefit between these 2 groups\nThis shows the importance of VO2 max\n\n\n\n\nPeople often spend too little or too much time in zone 5\nThis discussion will help you determine what that sweet-spot is\n\n This assumes that you are not training specifically for competition or athletic events that require unusual levels of fitness around the zone 5 energy system\n\n\nIf you are training to be a kick ass 90-year-old, then you don’t need to spend as much time in zone 5 as you might think\n\nWhat is Peter’s approach to zone 5 training and other anaerobic training protocols?\n\nPeter mostly uses the stairmaster for his zone 5 training\n\nThis is his favorite piece of equipment other than the bicycle\n\n\nHe does 1 zone 5 workout a week‒\n\n3 minutes of zone 2\n1 minute at VO2 max (this is quite difficult to keep this up for 1 minute)\nRepeat this 4-minute pattern for 20-30 minutes\nHe does this on the tail-end of a zone 2 workout; so this is his longer aerobic day\n\n\nBecause he knows what his VO2 max is, he can convert it into METS (Metabolic equivalent of task)\n\nThe stairmaster allows you to work at watts and METS\n\n\nWhen he’s outdoors on his bike, he likes to do a training-type/ VO2 max ride\n\n4 minutes at 125% FTP (functional threshold power)\nFollowed by 4 minutes of recovery\n\n\nThere’s lots of ways to hit zone 5 but Peter’s take is that most people spend too much time in zone 5 and not enough time in zone 2\n\nMore about Peter’s stairmaster machine\n\nHe uses a fancy one like they have at the gym; it has a series of steps that rotate (similar to #4 & #8 on this list) \nThe higher the intensity, the less resistance it provides; this makes you climb the steps faster\nAt 8 METS he steps quite slowly\nAt 20 METS it feels like there is no resistance and he’s running up the steps\nIf you’re working 100% (balls-to-the-wall), you can exceed your VO2 max in terms of the work you’re doing\n\nAlex Hutchinson writes about this in his book Endure \nAlex was also the guest for episode #151 – Alex Hutchinson, Ph.D.: Translating the science of endurance and extreme human performance\n\n\nAlex Hutchinson elegantly writes‒ the limits of human performance in terms of going all out, is about 10 seconds \nYou may think you’re going all out for 80% of a spin class, but you’re not\nConsider the difference between a 100 m and a 200 m sprint, run by the best athletes on the planet\n\nBy the time Usain Bolt is running the 200 m, he is slowing down in the second half of the race\nThe 100 m is about a 10-second race; this is about the limit of what a true all-out-effort means\n\n\nConsider 2 variants of Tabata: \n\n1 – The 20:10 Tabata (seconds of strenuous exercise: seconds of rest)\n2 – The 10:20 Tabata\nAnyone who has tried this knows you can go so much harder for the 10:20 than the 20:10\n\n\nPeter likes to use an Airbike for Tabata exercise \nThe 20:10 Tabata is favored because this is the one that was studied by Irisawa and Tabata \n\nIrsiawa developed the protocol and Tabata wrote the paper \n\nThis should be called the Irsiawas instead of the Tabata\n\n\nPublished in BMC in 2019, Tabata training: one of the most energetically effective high-intensity intermittent training methods\n\n\nThe problem with the 20:10 Tabata is you’re actually pacing yourself (whether consciously or subconsciously)\n\n \nA primer on VO2 max [52:00]\nThis next clip is from episode #151 – Alex Hutchinson, Ph.D.: Translating the science of endurance and extreme human performance; discussed from [38:00] – [49:30]\n\nAn analogy to think about VO2 max is‒ VO2 max is like the size of your engine \nPhysiologically, VO2 max tells you how quickly you can take oxygen from the air, into your lungs, get it into your blood, pump it to your muscles, and have your muscles use it in the metabolic processes that provide energy to move you\n\n VO2 max is a rate; it’s how much oxygen per unit of time can you process  \n\n\nVO2 max was first discussed/measured in the 1920s by a guy named A.V. Hill, a very good runner himself\n\nIf you ask someone to go out and run at a gentle pace, let’s say they consume 2 liters of oxygen per minute\nTell them to speed up, and now they’re doing 3 liters of oxygen per minute\nTell them to speed up again, and now they’re going really fast and they’re losing 4 liters of oxygen per minute\nTell them to speed up again, and they are still only using 4 liters of oxygen a minute\nIn other words, there’s a plateau‒ a point at which, even though you’re working harder, you’re not using any more oxygen; this is one’s VO2 max \n\nThis plateau looks like a physiological limitation\nThis is a point where, no matter how much you push yourself, you can’t get more oxygen (even though you can still go faster using other forms of energy)\nThis is the limits of your aerobic system \nThis doesn’t tell you how fast you can run\n\n\n\n\n\n“That [VO2 max] tells you what sort of aerobic engine you have to play with”‒ Alex Hutchinson\n\nPeople are used to hearing VO2 max reported, not in liters per minute but mL per min per kg\n\nExamples of VO2 max \n\nAn outlier VO2 max is a number bigger than 2 L or 5 L; this would be 75 or 80 mL\nAlex (a runner) was tested at just over 5 L/min\nIf you compared him to a rower, the rower would make him look pathetic because the rower would be using 7 L/min or more\n\nA rower is also twice his size, so this doesn’t mean that the rower is better because he has way more muscle to use the oxygen he’s taking in\n\n\nIf you want to compare apples-to-apples (athletes of different sizes), for a crude approximation, you divide by weight\n\nThis is reported as milliliters of oxygen per minute per kilogram of body weight\nFor Alex, 5 L/ min works out to 80 mL/min∙kg\nFor Peter who also measured at around 5L/min, he is heavier so this worked out to around 70 mL/min∙kg\n\n\nYou could argue that you should divide by lean mass not total body weight to account for skeletal tissue, fat, etc. as the amount of these tissues can vary but they doesn’t use more oxygen during exercise\n\nThere’s a whole rabbit hole you can go into, but at a certain point it doesn’t matter that much\nFor comparing to yourself, to see if you’ve increased your VO2 max, it doesn’t matter what you’re dividing by\n\n\n\n“You can’t just measure someone’s VO2 max and know how fast they’re going to race”‒ Alex Hutchinson\n\nWhen Peter was cycling competitively, there was a guy he would ride with whose VO2 max was 55-60 mL/min∙kg (Peter’s was 70 mL/min∙kg); but there was never a day where Peter could ride faster than him\n\nMaybe his friend was a more efficient athlete \n\n\n\nHistorical limits of VO2 max‒ what is it that causes VO2 max to plateau?   \n\nThere is a lot of confusion and debate about the limits of VO2 max \nIf you want to measure endurance by testing how fast someone can run a mile as hard as they can, but there are many factors that can affect this\n\nMotivation, pacing, lots of factors\n\n\nThe nice thing about VO2 max (and why scientists like it) is, in theory it’s independent of motivation\n\nThe plateau in oxygen intake is a property of their body and not a result of if they’re excited about the study/ exercise\n\n\nThe cause of this plateau could be in the lungs, in the heart, in the circulation, or in the muscle’s ability to extract oxygen from the bloodstream and make use of it metabolically in the mitochondria\n\nThis is controversial and limitations can arise in any part of this cascade \nConventional wisdom is that the lungs are not the limitation, you can always breathe enough in and they don’t respond to training because they’re overbuilt\n\nBut a review was published arguing that in some cases (such as highly-trained endurance athletes), the lungs aren’t overbuilt and can be a limitation on VO2 max\nPublished in the Journal of Applied Physiology in 1985, Is the healthy respiratory system built just right, overbuilt, or underbuilt to meet the demands imposed by exercise?\n\n\nThere is also the situation where an athlete is so fit, their heart pumps blood so quickly past their lungs, that it doesn’t have time to fully stock-up on oxygen\n\nThis results in exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia \nThis is usually an issue at altitude\nAbout half of endurance athletes experience this at sea level\n\n\nThere is debate on this because there isn’t any 1 single answer; limits of VO2 max can occur anywhere along the cascade of taking oxygen in and the muscle using it in the production of energy \n\n\nPeter notes that the way the oxygen consumption is calculated relies on measuring the oxygen concentration breathed out and calculating the difference (the delta) between that and the oxygen concentration in the air (breathed in)  \n\nIt would be interesting to test VO2 max while reducing the FIO2 (the fraction of inspired oxygen)\n\nTo put this in context, the typical FIO2 in any room is 21% oxygen\nIf FIO2 was reduced to 20%, 19%, 18%, etc. and if the lungs are not the limitation for VO2 max, then you should see the same  VO2 max (or measure the same absolute delta between inhaled versus exhaled oxygen) in all of these conditions of different oxygen %\n\nThis would be an interesting experiment to eliminate lungs and capillary exchange of oxygen as a limit on VO2 max\nAlex doesn’t think a study this detailed has been published\nPeople have compared 21% oxygen to 10% and 15% oxygen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess oxygen is available at altitude and funny things happen\n\nYou would think that the first thing to happen is, you would go anaerobic sooner and produce more lactate; but the opposite happens\n\nThis is called the lactate paradox\nIf you exercise to exhaustion at lower levels of altitude, you produce less lactate than you would a sea level\nThere’s debate over what causes this and if it’s a real thing\n\n\n\n\n\n“The picture that makes sense to me is, these things are not just about how much oxygen is making it to the muscle, it’s also‒ what is your brain-oxygen level”‒ Alex Hutchinson\n\nThere are these other circuit-breakers limiting VO2 max, that aren’t on the path from mouth to lung, to blood, to muscle\nThere are other factors that detect low oxygen and cut off the supply to the muscle to make sure we don’t get stupid [deprive the brain of oxygen]\n\n \nStability—the cornerstone upon which all exercise and movement relies [1:03:00]\nThis clip is from episode #92 – AMA #12: Strategies for longevity (which don’t require a doctor); discussed from [24:30] – [29:00]\nPeter along with Beth Lewis and Michael Rintala filmed instructional videos showing how to do various exercises \n\nPeter can’t recommend them enough\n\nIt’s one thing to hear talk about the exercises, it’s quite another thing to see them and be able to do them yourself\n\n\n\nVideos from Peter: \nHip hinge (VMO):\n\n\nDeadlifts: \n\n\nScapulae: \n\n\nConcentric intra-abdominal pressure (to stabilize the ribs):\n\n\nThe importance of stability\n“Stability is the cornerstone upon which your strength is delivered, your aerobic performance is delivered, and your anaerobic performance is delivered.  And it’s the way that you do so safely”‒ Peter Attia\n\nStability is the way that we transmit force from the body to the outside world \n\nIn the safest manner possible\nAcross the muscles which are designed to carry that load\nThis is opposed to seeing the dissipation of force across joints that are not fit to do so\n\n\nConsider picking up something that weighs 60 lbs, you have to exert 60 lbs of force on the world around you (according to Newton’s Laws)\n\nYou want all of that 60 lbs to be transmitted from your muscle, to the ground, to this thing you are picking up\nYou don’t want anything dissipating out your back, knees, or hips\n Most of us are born with the ability to do this naturally, but it generally gets lost by the time we begin grade school \n\nWhy? A relative lack of activity and an abundance of sitting\n\n\n\n\nWhen Peter looks at his  2 ½ year old move, it’s a perfect clinic in force transmission safely across the body\nIf you look at Peter move, prior to becoming obsessed with dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS), you see inefficiencies and force leakage (at his scapula, his knee, his elbow, his back, his hips\n\n This is one of the root causes of a lot of the chronic injuries many of us have \n\n\nStability is the foundation upon which all exercise should be done\nRecently Peter discussed this with a patient who had a question‒ should she do DNS or continue with the pilates she’s done for many years? \n\nA great pilates teacher is already teaching many of these principles\n\n\nStability is somewhat discipline agnostic but heavily dependant on the practitioner and the student \n\nThe correct patterns of movement are characterized by the ability to: \n\n1 – Get air fully into your lungs\n2 – Get your diaphragm low into your abdomen\n3 – Flatten out your pelvic floor\n4 – Generate concentric, robust, intra abdominal pressure that stabilizes every aspect of them\nPostural restoration (PRI), DNS, and pilates are all different ways one can learn these principles of stability\n\n“Of the 4 pieces of exercise that we will talk about, this is the one [stability] that probably will take the most tinkering for people to find the right type of practitioners”‒ Peter Attia\n \nPeter’s current exercise routine [1:07:45]\nFrom episode #196 – AMA #32: Exercise, squats, deadlifts, BFR, and TRT; discussed from [3:00] – [6:00]\n\nIn this last clip Peter talks about the macro structure of his current exercise routine\n\nThe macrostructure hasn’t changed much in the last year\nThe microstructure (exercises) has changed a lot\n\n\n Cardio days‒ Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday \n\n45 minutes of zone 2 training on Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday\nSaturday is 1 of the following:\n\nA zone 2 workout (45”) followed by zone 5 workout (30”)\nA longer bike ride, more of an anaerobic workout\n\n\n\n\n Weightlifting‒ Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday\n\n9 months ago, he switched to an upper body/ lower body split\nHe used to lift 3 days a week, and do upper body and lower body everyday\nNow he does lower body on Mondays and Fridays, and he does upper body on Wednesdays and Sundays\nHe always lifts AFTER doing cardio because the reverse has been shown to erode strength-training gains \n\n\n\nWhat happens if you miss a day?\n\nLast Sunday was supposed to be a cardio/ ride followed by a lift day; but he was on the track all day\n\nHe knew that in advance, so he did the lift on Saturday\nBut he was short-changed on the zone 2 workout\n\n\nHe will never compromise a lift; he will always get 4 lifts in per week\n\nSometimes it means moving the days around or doubling-up on another day\n\n\n\nDo you have a preference for the time of day to exercise?\n\nMonday – Friday, this happens in the morning once the kids are out the door, off to school\nThe weekends are more flexible\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialWhat is Peter optimizing for with his exercise: #92 – AMA #12: Strategies for longevity (which don’t require a doctor) | Host Peter Attia, The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (February 10, 2020) |  discussed from [30:30 – 33:45]\nHow to train for the “Centenarian Decathlon”: #50 – AMA #5: calcium scores, Centenarian Decathlon, exercise, muscle glycogen, keto, and more | Host Peter Attia, The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (April 22, 2019) | discussed from [18:15 – 33:45]\nStudy of genetics of centenarians: \n\nInstitute for Aging Research:  Longevity Genes Project | Albert Einstein College of Medicine | [20:15]\nBU School of Medicine:  New England Centenarian Study | Boston University | [20:15]\n\nThe importance of preserving strength and muscle mass as we age: #176 – AMA #27: The importance of muscle mass, strength, and cardiorespiratory fitness for longevity | Host Peter Attia, The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (September 20, 2021) | discussed from [58:00 – 1:03:30]\nReview of loss of lean muscle and strength due to aging: Strength and muscle mass loss with aging process.
