  "content": "Check out more of my recent content on COVID:\n\n(January 3, 2022) COVID Part 1: Current state of affairs, Omicron, and a search for the end game\n(January 23, 2022) Why I’m for COVID vaccines, but against vaccine mandates.\n(January 24, 2022) COVID Part 2: Masks, long COVID, boosters, mandates, treatments, and more\n(January 29, 2022) A follow-up to my article on vaccine mandates\n\n\nThis episode is a follow-up to our recent COVID-19 podcast with Drs. Marty Makary and Zubin Damania (aka ZDoggMD). Here, we address many of the listener questions we received about our original discussion. In addition to Marty and ZDoggMD, we are also joined by Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist and Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. In this episode, we talk about new data on Omicron, long COVID, masks, kids and schools, vaccine mandates, policy questions, and treatments. We also discuss some of the most prevalent misinformation and spend time talking about claims made by Robert Malone. We end with a conversation about our exit strategy.\n*Please note: we recorded this episode on January 17, 2022, and in an effort to get it out as soon as possible, this won’t have full show notes or a video. Additionally, Monica was only able to join us for the first section of the podcast, so you’ll hear her drop off partway through.\n<iframe title=\"COVID Part 2: Masks, long COVID, boosters, mandates, treatments, and more\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jAjKQY0_BQA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#192 - COVID Part 2: Masks, long COVID, boosters, mandates, treatments, and more\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#192 - COVID Part 2: Masks, long COVID, boosters, mandates, treatments, and more\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#192 - COVID Part 2: Masks, long COVID, boosters, mandates, treatments, and more\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nSeverity of infection from Omicron—reviewing the data [5:15];\nFactors contributing to the relative mildness of Omicron infections [8:30];\nIs SARS-CoV-2 evolving to cause less severe disease?

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations? [35:00]; What makes the human brain different than all other species? [44:15]; Imprinting stress to your kids epigenetically [48:00]; The role of stress on memory and the consequences of hypercortisolemia [53:00]; The impact of subjective socioeconomic status and social media on stress levels and health [57:45]; Tips for managing stress in the modern world [1:13:15]; What Robert learned about himself studying the social behavior of baboons [1:25:30]; The multilayered factors behind every human behavior, the context of “good and bad”, and exploring the human capacity of the wild extremes of violence and altruism from moment to moment [1:30:15]; PMS: How two women with identical hormone levels can have completely different emotional experiences [1:34:45]; How much of a role do genes play in depression and other emotional states? [1:38:00]; Why is cortisol elevated under sleep deprivation?

this is no longer a pandemic\nWe should have strategies geared toward an endemic now\n\n\n\nSeverity of infection from Omicron—reviewing the data [5:15]\n\nPreprint in medRxiv Jan. 11, 2022 – Clinical outcomes among patients infected with Omicron (B.1.1.529) SARS-CoV-2 variant in southern California\nThey found 52,000 cases of Omicron, none required mechanical ventilation\n\nAnd remember, 52,000 documented means there are 4-5 cases out there in the community for every 1 that is picked-up with testing\nRoughly half of infections are asymptomatic and a lot of people have a tough time getting access to testing\nSo we’re really looking at a population of, say, a quarter million people with Omicron and nobody required a ventilator\n\n\nThere was 1 death in this group (not in the ICU or intubated)\nInfection with the Omicron variant was determined using PCR diagnosis where S gene dropout was observed\nThere was a net total of 154 people who were hospitalized out of, say, a quarter million infected with Omicron\nOf those hospitalized, 83% were there in the hospital for less than 48 hours\n\nRemember way back about 2 months ago, this is exactly what the South African doctors observed early on\nThey noticed people were in the hospital about two days instead of eight days, and they proclaimed to the world this is a mild infection \n\n\nAccording to the most recent CDC numbers, 98.3% of new cases of COVID in the United States are Omicron \n\nOn December 10th, it hit 73%\nNow, we’re at 98.3%\nSo we’re dealing with a different virus\n\n\nPeople who are still in the hospital are those who came in with Delta\n\nUnvaccinated people who got Delta\nAnd remember, people stay in the hospital a long time especially right now and it’s very difficult to discharge a COVID positive patient to a skilled facility or rehab so that’s inflating the numbers a little bit\nHospitals are truly strained, but it’s really those who had Delta\n\n\nIf we look at the future, Omicron promises to be a mild virus based on all of this data\n\n \nFactors contributing to the relative mildness of Omicron infections [8:30]\nCurrent numbers of people in the hospital with Omicron\n\nMarty just looked this up, NYU, for example, reported 53% are not there for COVID, but they are COVID positive\n\nThese are incidental COVID admissions\n\n\nIn Jackson Memorial in Florida, 65% are incidental COVID positive cases\nPerhaps 50% to 60% of the COVID hospitalizations are incidental\nThis depends on how highly vaccinated the region is\nThe numbers are even higher out in California for people with COVID in their noses because so many people are tested\n\nSo LA County reported 67%\nThis was closest to what we saw in South Africa during the Omicron surge which was 63%. \nAnd it wasn’t that South Africa was a highly vaccinated region; it was about a 25% vaccinated region\n\nInstead, a seroprevalence study in SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa that showed 79% of adults had SARS-CoV-2 antibody\nSo think of South Africa, between natural immunity and vaccines, as likely having the same degree of immunity as California\n\n\nSo the higher the vaccinated region, the higher the incidental rate is\n\n\n\nStudy in South Africa just released aims to dissect the contribution of immunity to outcomes with Omicron versus the contribution a milder variant \n\nAdding to this, a couple Omicron studies came out yesterday verifying this\nOne from South Africa was really well-documented\n\nIt tried to tease out the reason for better outcomes with Omicron, looking at the contribution of immunity versus the more milder aspect of Omicron \nThis focused on the 4th wave in South Africa\nPreprint published on medRxiv January 12, 2022, Outcomes of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Omicron-driven fourth wave compared with previous waves in the Western Cape Province, South Africa \nThis compared outcomes in the 4th wave to the prior 3 waves\nEssentially what this study showed was that absolutely immunity is contributing to why in December 2021, January 2022, we’re having a better outcome with the latest variant\n\n\n\n“The contribution of immunity, both natural immunity and vaccine induced, estimated vaccination probably led to a 0.24 hazards ratio of a severe outcome” – Monica Gandhi\n\nA hazard ratio compares the risk in 2 groups\n\nA hazard ratio of 1 means there is not difference between the 2 groups\nA hazard ratio of more than 1 or less than 1 means outcomes were better in 1 of the groups\n\n\nHere this study is looking at the risk of severe outcomes from COVID infection in people who have some form of immunity (from vaccination or recovery from infection) compared to people without immunity\n\nThey conclude that immunity provided protection from severe COVID outcomes with a hazard ratio of 0.24\nThe hazard ratio here divides the occurrence of severe COVID outcomes in people with immunity by the occurrence of severe COVID outcomes in people without immunity \n\n\nAs doctors in South Africa kept saying the Omicron variant is more mild, the fundamental question became, “Okay, is Omicron more mild because we have so much immunity in the population at this point, January 2022 now, that our T cells and B cells are attacking that SARS-CoV-2 variant?”\nIt takes a while for the B cells to make antibodies; one may not have antibodies right away\nMaybe if one just got boosted, they may have antibodies right away if they’re older\nBut say someone has been vaccinated or has natural infection\n\nThey now have T cells; and their B cells produce antibodies\nThis attacks that virus; it brings down the viral load quickly\nThis will make it less infectious and it helps the person do well with the virus\n\n\nAnd so, immunity, of course, will help one do well\nThis is what probably what happened in 1918 when the world was transitioning from pandemic to endemic\n\nThere was a lot of immunity to influenza in the world\n\n\nThe next question is also, is Omicron less virulent inherently than the other strains that we’ve had so far, the other variants we’ve had so far? \n\nYes, it seems to be not just based on the 6 laboratory studies, including 2 in ex vivo lung transplants\n\nSo this is human lung tissue\n\n\nAnd then also animal studies that show it can’t infect lung cells very well\n6  studies now\n\n\nWhat the South Africa study showed us was very good analysis distinguishing between immunity making it more mild and also having fewer less virulent,\n\n“They estimated it’s 25% less virulent than Delta above and beyond immunity” – Monica Gandhi\n\nSo it’s not just our increasing immunity in the population that’s making Omicron more mild, but it’s something to do with the virus itself likely, that it can’t infect lung cells well\n\n \nIs SARS-CoV-2 evolving to cause less severe disease? [13:00]\n\nLess severe outcomes observed in children under 5 infected with Omicron versus Delta\n\nPreprint available on medRxiv and PMC January 2, 2022, Comparison of outcomes from COVID infection in pediatric and adult patients before and after the emergence of Omicron\n\n\n\nDo viruses cause milder disease as they become endemic?\n\nEvolution of virus is accompanied with lessening of disease severity\nWill SARS-CoV-2 become a virus that causes disease with severity somewhere between common-cold-coronaviruses and influenza (that causes the flu)?\nMonica notes this makes sense evolutionarily and that’s been the pattern in history\nShe also notes that if a more virulent strain arises, we have the protection of immunity across the entire virus from B cells, T cells, antibodies\nA lot of people have seen Omicron\n\nProbably 50% of people in Europe \nIt’s estimated that 25% of Americans (probably more) have seen Omicron\n\n\nInfection with Omicron results in T cells and B cells that will fight that new variant in the future, even if it’s more virulent\n\n“Both the FDA chief and the NIH chief have said we’re all going to see Omicron” – Monica Gandhi\nBreak-through infections with Omicron provide broad immunity to other variants\n\nPreprint available at medRxiv January 13, 2022, Immunity in Omicron SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough COVID-19 in vaccinated adults \nThis study shows that when someone gets a natural Omicron infection on top of their vaccines, they form broadly neutralizing antibodies against all the variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta)\nImportantly, one forms T cells and B cells that work across all the variants\nRemember, the vaccines we have in this country only expose us to the spike protein of the virus, so just one piece of the virus as opposed to the whole virus\n\n \nPotential of Covaxin—an inactivated virus-based COVID-19 vaccine [17:45]\nAdvantages of a whole-agent vaccine\n\nSomething Monica has been thinking about lately is why we don’t have Covaxin in this country\nCovaxin filed for an EUA 73 days ago with the FDA\n\n“If you don’t see Omicron, I wish the booster could be Covaxin” – Monica Gandhi\n\nZDoggMD asks if there is a difference in mucosal antibody immunity between the mRNA vaccines (specific only to the spike protein) and Covaxin (an inactivated, whole virus)\nMonica explains that when someone is exposed to the virus, they develop IgA antibodies in their nose\n\nThese go down with time\n\n\nThere’s a great interest in mucosal, nasal vaccines to help decrease transmission\nBut it is true that if one gets Covaxin or gets exposure to the actual virus, they develop IgA against multiple parts of the virus\nWith the mRNA vaccines, one is developing IgA against only the spike protein\n\nComparing the vaccines\n\nThinking back to the early days of the vaccine, Pfizer was approved with an EUA on November 9th and then Moderna was November 16th\nAnd then J&J and AstraZeneca followed shortly thereafter, single dose\nPeter asks if the absolute risk reduction was greater with J&J than both Pfizer and Moderna\nBoth Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca are adenovirus DNA vector vaccines\n\nThey show a different part of the spike protein, which is why mixing them exposes one to more of the spike protein antigen\n\n\nBut what Monica thinks happens with the DNA antiviral vectors is they produced a more robust T cell response than the mRNA vaccines, and T cells are the long-lasting friends\n\nRemember, those who’ve survived SARS-CoV the first one\n\nSARS from 2003, late 2002 to early 2003\n\n\nThere are people 17 years later that they have strong T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-1\n\n\nT cells are the long-lasting arm in the immune system\nAntibodies always come down\n\nIf someone had antibodies for every cold they’ve ever had in their body, they couldn’t move because the blood would be so thick with antibodies\n\n\nAstraZeneca seems to produce and Johnson & Johnson stronger T cells response\n\n \nHow B cells and T cells work together to defend against viruses [22:00]\n\nPeter asks why is that the wrong metric to exclusively focus on antibody levels as opposed to understanding how the T cells work? \nWhat’s the difference between these B cells and T cells and how they actually kill viruses?\nMonica explains that T cells are actually the main arm of the immune system that fight viruses\n\nSo for example, she’s an HIV doctor\nSo as T cells go down, people are susceptible to very severe viral infections\nT cells are cells that last for a long time; they’re called cellular memory\n\n\nAnd then what B cells do is they become the recipe book or the template to produce more antibodies, but they have to be aided by T cells to do so\nAntibodies, which are pieces of protein, they will come down with time\n\nThey will come down even after a booster, say, 10 weeks or so\n\n\nB cells are known to develop after vaccination\n\nIn studies they’ve biopsied bone marrows from people who’ve had natural infection, lymph nodes from people who had the RNA vaccines \nIt has been observed that people produce strong B cells in what are called germinal centers\nThe B cells will, if they see the virus again, aided by T cells will produce antibodies directed against that SARS-CoV-2 when they see it in the future\nAnd not only will they produce antibodies, but they will actually adapt those antibodies to the variant they see\nIf they see Delta, they’ll make Delta-specific antibodies, Omicron, Omicron-specific antibodies, Zeta, Zeta-specific antibodies because that’s what adaptive immunity is\nThey vary the recipe based on the conditions; that’s what adaptive immunity means\nSo B cells will produce antibodies against the variant they see aided by T cells\n\n\nAnd then T cells line the whole virus and directly kill the virus itself\n\n“T cells and B cells, which are formed by the vaccines and natural immunity, will last a long time and will enable us to have ongoing immunity to the virus in the future, even different variants” – Monica Gandhi\n\nB cells could last 90 years\n\nPeople who have gotten influenza in 1918 and then they found these 90-year-old, 100-year-old people, they looked at their B cells and they said, “Oh, you actually can produce antibodies directed against the influenza strain from 1918, 90 years later.” \n\n\n\n \nComparing the COVID-19 vaccines, and the rationale for the time between doses  [25:30]\n\nIn the US, only Pfizer is off EUA (emergency use authorization); it’s the only vaccine to have full approval \nCovaxin is the inactivated, whole-virus vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in India \nCovovax is a protein subunit COVID-19 vaccine developed by Novavax Inc \nZDoggMD notes that the CDC has indicated a preference for the mRNA vaccines to J&J \nPaul Offit and others have speculated that J&J really always should have been a 2-dose vaccine\n\nAs a single dose, it had a lot of promise initially, but it’s looking more like it should have been a double dose vaccine\nAnd then, there is the vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia issue which seems to be a class effect with the adenovirus vector vaccines because AstraZeneca has it as well\n\nMonica adds that Sputnik V isanother adenovirus DNA vector vaccine; they all have this rare side effect\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16647\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/f1-covid2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"863\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/f1-covid2.png 520w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/f1-covid2-181x300.png 181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" />\nFigure 1. 9 COVID vaccines compared.  Image credit: BBC \nWhy use of the J&J vaccine paused while use of Moderna was not? [26:30]\n\nZDoggMD thinks this comes down to severity\nThe outcomes of people who get vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia can be very bad to fatal\n\nIt’s very rare, but it is catastrophic if it happens\n\n\nWhereas with myocarditis, at least from the early series that we have, is generally reversible\n\nAlthough it requires hospitalization and is still terrifying for parents and children, this is less of a catastrophic issue\n\n\nThe interesting question is what is worse for generating myocarditis— natural coronavirus infection or the vaccine? \n\nThis is where data sets seem to disagree and how one interprets them\n\n\nMarty notes, those studies did a head-to-head comparison and found that the rates of myocarditis after vaccination were higher, particularly with Moderna\n\nIn parts of Europe they’ve restricted Moderna in anyone under age 30\nThis hasn’t been discussed in the US\n\n\nThere’s also this interesting idea— the myocarditis from vaccination may be different than the myocarditis from the infection itself \n\nThere may be more delayed contrast uptake in the heart that they’re noticing in the studies of the myocarditis from vaccination\nSo there’s a feeling among cardiologists that it’s not the exact same apples to apples myocarditis \n\n\nMonica also notes the difference in the amount of RNA the vaccines contain\n\nModerna has 100 micrograms, Pfizer’s 30 micrograms\nSo that dose difference probably explains why myocarditis could be more seen with the Moderna vaccine\n\nIt’s literally a higher dose\n\n\n\n\nShe thinks the best study on this is from Canada \n\nThat showed that the risk of myocarditis after the second dose is more with higher dose Moderna vaccine\nAnd also more if there is a shorter period between the 2 doses\n\nThis is why spacing the doses has been such a strategy in Canada of 8 weeks or even longer between doses\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the rationale behind the time between vaccine doses?\n\nPeter asks about the immunologic rationale for why the mRNA vaccines were dosed at four weeks apart\nMonica thinks it was simply expediency because the trials were conducted in a hurry\n\nWe were in the middle of a pandemic \nSo they tested Pfizer 3 weeks apart\nAnd Moderna 4 weeks apart\n\n\n\nWhat time between vaccine doses would provide the most durable immune response?\n\nDr. Stanley Plotkin wrote a Clinical Infectious Disease article in January \nHe was saying we need to space them out longer for 2 reasons\n\n1) One was to save more lives because if there is a limited supply, we want to save more lives by giving people just 1 dose (and then give them the second dose later)\n\n1 dose will provide some T cell immunity\n\n\n2) And then the second was he said that in any field of vaccinology (and now this has been shown in a Cell paper) if you give longer time between doses, you get a better response\n\nPublished October 15, 2021, Immunogenicity of standard and extended dosing intervals of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine\nNot just increased antibody responses, but fundamentally what we were talking about is we want to develop cellular memory \nThere’s better T cell responses if you space them out, the doses, by 8 weeks or so\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks what would be the ideal time to give a booster to somebody who has 2 shots of Moderna or Pfizer\n\nNobody would be 1 year out from their second show now because these things just became available\nIs giving a booster in less than a year the optimal way to boost long-term immunity?\nWould we be better off boosting less frequently?\n\n\nMonica explains, to extrapolate on the 3-dose vaccines from the hepatitis B vaccine and the human papilloma virus vaccine— the longer the time between the 2nd and 3rd doses, the better\nDr. Plotkin talks about this in the CID article; what happened here with the booster is that we had a lot of high transmission with Omicron, and then the idea was, “Oh, if we give the booster, maybe we can bring transmission down” \n\nThat’s all Monica can see as to why there were widespread booster recommendations as opposed to more selected booster recommendations for those who were more at risk for severe disease\nShe thinks it was an attempt to increase antibodies to bring transmission down \n\n\n\n \nReviewing the purpose and effectiveness of boosters for reducing severity and transmission [32:30]\n\nPeter asks if there is data on how the vaccine reduces transmission\nMonica explains that vaccines will increase antibodies and this could reduce transmission\nThere was an Omicron paper studying transmission within households, and given a boost did decrease transmission\n\nPreprint on medRxiv December 27, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC Transmission in Danish Households\n\n\nMonica notes, if the patient benefits from a booster to reduce severe disease, then that’s when we would give a booster in how we usually do infectious disease\n\nNot for this purpose of reducing transmission\nLater if we get a different variant and virus goes up in the community she doesn’t think we will give a booster to try and decrease transmission\n\n\nPeter asks how long this effect lasts\nThe UK study suggests 10 weeks\n\nPublished in Nature Medicine January 14, 2022, Effectiveness of COVID-19 booster vaccines against covid-19 related symptoms, hospitalization and death in England\nThe booster makes the antibodies go up and then come right back down after 10 weeks\n\n\nIt’s just never been done that we give boosters to decrease transmission\nWe usually give boosters in a risk versus benefit analysis for the patients\nWe want to make sure it’s safe for the patient and then also we want to make sure that it does something beneficial for the patient\n\nWhich in this case would be keeping them out of the hospital\nThis is important for older people, immunocompromised people, people who have medical conditions, maybe everyone over 40\n\n\n\nWhy are universities requiring students to get a 3rd dose?\n\nPeter comments, “if we were to speculate based on the policies that are in place of providing boosters to healthy college kids in an effort to prevent transmission, the only logically consistent thing to do would be to make sure college kids get boosters every 10 weeks for the rest of their lives”\nMonica replies that it is  profoundly not recognized is how well the vaccines work for the older adult who is teaching the student\n\nEven 2 doses, certainly 3 doses if they’re older\nShe asks Marty and ZDoggMD if they think the healthcare worker study in the New England Journal of Medicine from Israel showed anyone over 50 really benefits from a third dose, even in reducing severe disease\n\nPublished in Lancet December 4, 2021, Effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for preventing severe outcomes in Israel: an observational study\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC showed us just in a study two weeks ago that even with the 2-dose vaccines, the chance of dying from COVID (across the entire swath of the population) was 0. 00003\n\nThere were specific risk groups that were at risk for severe outcomes; they were older people over 75 with multiple comorbidities, 4 comorbidities\n\nThese patients should be boosted, maybe even get a 4th booster; and they should be masking themselves for protection\n\n\n\n\nMonica notes, putting all this together means that we have underestimated those college students, if they’re around vaccinated staff members and teachers, those vaccinated staff members and teachers are doing great\nThe vaccines are working well\nWhat we were so scared of was severe disease from COVID\n\nAre there any bad outcomes from a vaccine booster (3rd dose))?\n\nWhat is the rationale for not boosting with the same antigen again and again?\nMonica replies, the term is original antigenic sin\n\nWhen the immune system keeps seeing the same piece of protein\nThe adaptive immunity allows one to produce trained immunity to whatever virus is seen in front of them\nWe don’t want to train the immune system to respond to the ancestral strain\n\n\n Marty notes that even the European CDC basically said specifically that repeated boosters could cause “problems with the immune system”\n\nAnecdotes of autoimmunity \n\nMarty and his colleagues have seen cases that raise questions about the onset of autoimmune disease, either immediately after the second dose or after a very mild infection in somebody fully vaccinated\nMaybe the immune system was revved up and caused juvenile diabetes in an adult\n\nHow often do you see that on day two of a very mild infection?\n\n\nNow, the risk benefit still favors vaccination\nThis is not an argument to say, “Hold off on vaccines because there’s concern” \nThis is an argument to say, “Only give boosters if there’s a clinical benefit”\n\n“The frustrating thing is, as you alluded to, Peter, if we would’ve spaced out these doses, we might not even be talking about boosters” – Marty Makary\nInfection with Omicron is the best booster [39:45] \n\nZDoggMD notes that the best booster of all is infection with Omicron; this would be true of any natural infection\n\nInfection elicits profound T and B cell responses; broad neutralizing antibodies across the whole virus\n\n\n\n“That is the best booster of all, unless you got a Covaxin booster” – ZDoggMD\n\nWhen these B-cells are retriggered, you get another process of what they call somatic hypermutation\n\nThe B-cells are constantly undergoing mutational process to diversify\n\n\n\n“The worded adaptive truly means you adapt your own immune system to what you see” – Monica Gandhi\n \nDebating vaccine mandates, and putting COVID’s mortality risk in perspective [41:00]\n\nPeter asks what everyone thinks about vaccine mandates; he’s looking for a diversity of opinion\nMonica replies that when she and ZDoggMD had this discussion previously, she favored mandates and he did not\n\nOne argument is that the vaccines reduce transmission\n\nThis argument has become weaker\n\n\nThen each successive variant evades antibodies more (even though the T cells and B cells are intact)\n\n\nMonica supports mandates because she works in a hospital and there is no doubt that the people in the ICU and the people who are sick are unvaccinated adults\n\nIf our entire purpose of a lot of what we did throughout this pandemic was to save hospitals, then not having hospitals have unvaccinated people when they could have gotten the vaccine, allows us to work on other aspects of hospitalization\n\n\n\n“I think the vaccinated are more concerned about thinking that their vaccines don’t work than the unvaccinated” – Monica Gandhi\n\nThose who are  vaccinated are more concerned about COVID than those who are unvaccinated\nPeople are fearful\nPeople don’t trust vaccines— this is a failure of public health messaging\n\nPeople have difficulty estimating risk [43:00]\n\nPeter is reminded of an interesting anecdote; he recently had to mediate a family conflict about a son who didn’t want to get vaccinated\nHe listened and asked a simple question of the father, “What do you believe is the risk that your son will be hospitalized or die if he contracts COVID in an unvaccinated state?”\n\nHis son was 38 and is very healthy\nHe said 50%\nNow Peter understood why the father was so distraught over this, he literally thought his child was making a decision that put them at a 50% risk of death\n\n\nHe showed him the data\n\nThere was a 10-fold difference in the actual risk of hospitalization of death without the vaccine, a 1-log difference\n\n\n\nWhat are the facts on risk?\n\nMonica notes COVID is a very interesting and different virus in the sense that young children are very low risk for severe disease\n\nThis isn’t true of, for example, influenza, which affects young children and the extremes of age (elderly)\n\n\nSomehow people are not aware of the epidemiology of COVID\nMonica blames public health officials also for not clearly laying it out, how much more at risk one is when they’re older\nShe also blames public health officials for not even putting out this data of how vaccines really make one almost immune to the severe outcomes\n\nUnless someone is in specific risk groups in which case they are vulnerable and must be protected\n\n\n\nEmotional resistance to mandates \n\nZDoggMD notes the emotional response to mandates\nIf he could wave a magic wand and have everyone eligible to be vaccinated at a minimal level that prevents severe disease, he would do it in an instant because he knows this would reduce suffering\nHe sees the emotional reaction to mandates and the psychological reactance to a government that nobody trusts and a public health apparatus that people don’t trust\nPeople don’t want to be told what to do\nThis is why he is nervous about the public health policy tool of mandates\n\nHe’s worried it will backfire in a longer emotional way in a segment of the population that could be reached otherwise with education\nThe Swedes don’t mandate anything; they trust their government\nNow the questions is how to wield policy to make that happen\n\n\n\nPutting risk in context [48:45]\n\nConsider deaths from any of the top causes of death as a fraction of COVID deaths\n\nDivide the number of deaths from any cause by the number of deaths from COVID\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16648\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/f2-covid2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"617\" height=\"459\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/f2-covid2.png 617w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/f2-covid2-300x223.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" />\nFigure 2. Specific death rates as a multiple of COVID deaths.  Data from: NSC & CDC\n\nMarty finds this comparison so compelling\n\nWhat this graph shows is that deaths from each of these independently— motor vehicle accidents, suicide, homicide, drug overdoses, just blow COVID out of the water\nThese are the major public health threats facing young people\nIt just shows how we have had massive blind spots during this entire pandemic\n\n\nPeople don’t just die of COVID; they die of depression and poverty and hopelessness and alcohol and stress and deferred cancer care and drug abuse\n\nThat is the broader perspective\nThat’s the context Marty thinks we’ve lost\n\n\n\n\nRemember when Joe Rogan had Sanjay Gupta on his podcast\n\n#1718 – Dr. Sanjay Gupta (October 2021)\nRogan points out the data on young unvaccinated children and the hospitalizations are significantly clustered in kids with comorbid conditions\nThose are the ones that should be a priority for vaccination\nThe risk stratification for a healthy child is different\n\n\n\n\nMarty notes the numbers of unvaccinated people in the US getting hospitalized for COVID is 65.9 per 100,000 per week \n\nThat was roughly at the peak of Delta that ended up being about 1 in 1,500 people in the population\nAnd these people were generally older, not a young, healthy 30-year-old \n\n\n Risk can be stratified  by comorbid condition\nMarty thinks immunity requirements make sense in healthcare for those who are patient facing\n\nHe doesn’t think the same calculus applied to the accountant working at home for the hospital\n\n\nWe’ve been sitting stagnant at 85 to 86% of the adult population in the United States vaccinated for a long time\nHe thinks all these discussions of the mandates hardened a lot of people\nAnd a lot of these immunity requirements do not account for natural immunity\n\nCrazy anecdote of illogical outcomes from vaccine mandates\n\nHospitals who have laid off staff for not being vaccinated are left working with a skeleton crew\n\nThere’s a hospital system in Washington State, in Tacoma and Olympus; it’s called MultiCare\nMultiCare laid off 55 staff for not being vaccinated\nThat’s on top of the people who left before the vaccine requirement took effect\n\n\nThe hospital asked people who called in sick with COVID to come in back and work in the hospital\n\nThis is a memo, reported from Jason Rantz, that Marty tweeted the other day\nIt says, basically, even if you have symptoms, if you’ve tested positive, come back, unless the symptom is fever\nThen, they told the managers, “Hey, when you assign these workers, try not to assign them to people. immunosuppressed. If anything, try to assign them to patients who have COVID. Let COVID staff take care of COVID patients.” \n\n\nThis is the insanity of blanket policies hardening people requirements that do not account for immunity\nWashington State had this harsh few exception, no exception vaccine mandate\nConsider snow plow workers in Washington State\n\nThey work alone driving a snow truck\nOne of the main highways in Washington State then got snowed in; it was undriveable\nThe county, Kittitas County offers to then plow this road for the state\n\nThe state should be plowing it, but they don’t have enough snow plowers\n\n\nThe state says, “No, you’re not allowed to because your snow plow workers do not have the vaccine mandate. They’re not under the vaccine mandate.”\n\n\n\nNatural immunity should be factored into vaccine mandates\n\nMonica thinks that recovery or having natural immunity should always be taken into account\nThere is a study soon to be published about reinfection in healthcare workers\n\nPublished in PLoS One January 4, 2022, Incidence of COVID-19 reinfection among Midwestern healthcare employees\nThis reported that healthcare workers were equally as likely to be reinfected if they had been vaccinated versus had natural immunity \nAnd severe disease was equally as protected\n\n\nRecovery immunity always has to be taken into account for any mandate\n\n“I think that our country is unable to have nuanced conversation about COVID” – Monica Gandhi\n\nWe will have a lot to do after this to figure out why we allowed healthcare workers to not drive the conversation about COVID\n\nAnd we allowed people who don’t have a lot of expertise in a way to drive the conversation\n\n\n\nAntidote from a previous podcast guest who will remain anonymous [60:45]\n\nThis person is a professor at an Ivy League University \nThey do really remarkable work\nThey were fired in November 2021 for not getting vaccinated\nThe point here is that the University has its own mandate program absent the federal government\n\nMandates continue\n\nPeter has read that 50 of the fortune 500 companies in the US are going to continue with mandates even in the context of the recent Supreme Court decision\nHe doesn’t think this issue of vaccine mandates is going away\nCertainly states like California and New York may be still deciding to create their own mandate\nAlmost every single country in Europe takes natural immunity into account, why isn’t this considered in the US?\n\n \nWhy the topic of COVID has become so polarized [1:03:15]\n\nZDoggMD speculates that we’ve created a God-shaped hole in our society over multiple years of secularization,\nWhat’s happened now is a situation that polarizes people almost the way a religion would\nLook at the natural immunity versus vaccine immunity camps\nIt is a sanctity versus degradation issue for people with purity issue\n\nIf you’re a Covidian and you’re in the thesis camp and you’re like, “No. Vaccines are the answer. We get through this through vaccine related immunity,” you are unclean, unpure, undesirable and unwelcome if you are not vaccinated\nIf someone got the disease previously, they already have a strike against them because they didn’t mask up, they didn’t distance, and they are unclean\n\n\nOn the other side, there’s an equal religious fervor and that is this holy sacraments of Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin \n\nAnd the conspiracy end times revelation aspect of these guys are trying to hide something from us, poisoning us by injecting our holy temples, our bodies with vaccines\n\n\nBoth sides on this that are polarized; they have a religious aspect to it,\n\nThat’s why it’s been so hard to understand why this is going on\n\n\nMonica notes that Omicron is actually destigmatizing; that’s good, in a way\n\nIt’s a very highly transmissible respiratory variant\nIt can’t be eradicated like we thought this disease could be at the beginning\n\n\nOmicron won’t be eliminated because—\n\nIt is a highly transmissible respiratory variant \nIt has animal reservoirs\nIt has a presymptomatic period where one is infectious\nIt has a long infectious period \nAnd vaccines elicit non-sterilizing immunity\n\n\n\n“All of that means it cannot be eradicated, but it can be made endemic. It can be controlled.” – Monica Gandhi\n\nIt is the time where the shame of getting a pathogen is being destigmatized\n\n \nReviewing the data on masks for protecting oneself and protecting others [1:06:30]\nWhat do we know today about the efficacy both at protecting one’s self and protecting others?\n\nMonica’s first podcast with ZDoggMD was that cloth masks seem to reduce the severity of illness. Then, there were some NIH studies that showed that actually, it’s probably the humidification of air when you’re wearing a cloth mask that reduces the severity of symptoms.\n\nMonica’s podcast with ZDoggMD about cloth masks: Masks may do more than we think (w/Dr. Monica Gandhi) | Host Dr. Zubin Damania  (ZDoggMD, September 13, 2020) | [1:07:15]\n\n\n\n“The best way to reduce the severity of symptoms is to get vaccinated, right?” – Monica Gandhi\n\nThere are certain masks that seem to work best for the individual\nWe cannot be mandating mask mandates for the whole population anymore because transmission doesn’t seem to be reduced by cloth masks, doesn’t seem to be reduced by even surgical masks, unless you really tuck them in and double loop them and so forth\nThe Bangladesh randomized controlled study of mask was reanalyzed by a group at Berkeley and cloth masks and surgical masks did little for the population level, but what a mask does is it one way protects you\nMonica thinks the CDC should tell people worried about exposure to wear the right kind of mask\n\nProtective masks are N95, SKN95, SKF94, FFP2s, double masks, or even tucked in surgical masks\n\n\nIt’s important to give people information and let them decide instead of creating a mandate for the whole population\n\nThere are some people who want no exposure to Omicron\nThere are some people who really feel protected by their vaccine\n\nEven if they have mild symptoms, they feel okay about that.\n\n\nThere are some people who have no risk tolerance\nThere are some people who have high risk tolerance\nMonica wants her father to wear an N95 because he happens to be getting chemotherapy right now, and he’s 87\nShe wants her child who’s low risk and fully vaccinated to be able to not wear a mask\n\n\nMonica’s interest in cloth masks and my interest in masking were for the individual for reducing severe disease\n\nData now from the NIH with humidification of air supports this\n\n\nHowever, the Bangladesh RCT Mask Study, which was published in Science has now been corrected because the raw data got put out\n\n3 groups looked at the raw data and it didn’t look like cloth reduced transmission \nAnd even surgical masks actually was much less than originally said in the interpretation of the Bangladesh RCT in villages\nMaybe if one tucked in their surgical mask and double looped it and really sucked it to their face, this could make surgical masks work better because they are polypropylene material\n\n\nPeter asks if Monica will wear a mask when she visits her father\nShe will see him in a couple weeks and will either test and make sure that she’s negative before she hugs him or she’ll wear a good mask while she’s waiting for the test\n\nShe can’t risk exposing him\nHe is in that category where he can have a severe breakthrough\n\n\nThe implication is that he wears a mask to protect him and she will wear a mask to protect him\nBack to mask mandates— now that vaccines are available, masks should be a choice\n\nThat’s different from a mandate\n\n\nPeter is vocal about his personal choice, he doesn’t wear a mask [1:12:00]\nMonica was really into masks early on,before the vaccines were available\nBut now that 2 years of data are available, their utility is clear\nShe advises people to look at Joseph Allen’s work and Shera Donna’s work\n\nMasks that offer the best protection\n\nN95s, KN95s, FFP2s, KF94s, a double mask with cloth and surgical, or the final option is actually a cloth mask with a surgical filter inside, a filter inside that’s polypropylene material\n\nThat last option is probably the most comfortable; a cloth mask with a filter inside\nAll of these have been studied very well\nAll of these protect the individual\nFor someone who wants no exposure, wear one of those masks\n\n\n\nMask mandates on airplanes and in federal buildings [1:14:30]\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration task force advisors wrote a piece in JAMA just two weeks ago; it was similar to a piece I’d written in Time that said you have to accept that we have to live with COVID\n\n\n\n\nJAMA January 6, 2022, A National Strategy for the “New Normal” of Life With COVID\n\n\nTime December 22, 2021 updated January 19, 2022, We Can’t Just Impose Restrictions Whenever COVID-19 Surges. Here’s a Better Plan for 2022 \n\n\nMonica thinks there’s going to be 4 things that happen that are different now than before what used to happen in the world\n\n1) We have to protect ourselves from respiratory pathogens as a whole\nWe’re probably going to always vaccinate\n2) We need better treatments and we need more of those treatments\n3)  More attention should be paid to ventilation for all respiratory pathogens\n4) There will be people who want to mask \n\nWear those 6 types of masks \nMonica doesn’t think wearing a mask can be mandated\nShe doesn’t think it’ll be mandated in California after February 15th, nor for travel after March or whatever date Biden has said\n\n\n\n\n\n“One way masking works. It’s like your vaccine protects yourself. Your mask protects yourself, too.” – Monica Gandhi\n \nThe inconsistent logic used for mask mandates [1:16:00]\nShould kids be required to wear masks in school? \n\nThis is up to local school districts in many states, but Marty would say the majority of schools require masks\nUnfortunately, a lot of kids are wearing the cloth masks\nSo they’re getting all the downside of hiding their faces, not learning how to read facial expressions, all those other things\n\nAnd none of the supposed upside of protection\n\n\nThere was a Brown University study that talked about significant cognitive and motor delays in children that can only be ascribed to the loss of the human connection\n\nPreprint available in medRxiv, August 11, 2021, Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Early Child Cognitive Development: Initial Findings in a Longitudinal Observational Study of Child Health\n\n\nLooking at the risk stratification in kids, it’s just a whole different ballpark as we’ve talked about\nHonestly, we are now using policies designed around Beta and Delta in an era of Omicron, which is behaving very differently\n\n“What happens when Omicron is essentially gone and now we’ve got wave a year from now, but it’s parainfluenza? Or we have a rhinovirus wave, which we have every year? Then what?” – Marty Makary\n\nThere was a study we discussed last time in PNAS looking at N95 masks with and without a nose piece and surgical masks\n\nCloth masks weren’t studied, maybe because they recognized there is no value in them\nPublished December 7, 2021, An upper bound on one-to-one exposure to infectious human respiratory particles\nThey found that if an infected person is in direct contact with somebody else for 20 minutes, the risk of transmission with surgical masks was 10.4%\n\nWith an N95 without a nose piece it was 4.2% \nAnd an N95 with a nose piece, in other words, a good seal, 0.14%\n\n\nSo that tells us a lot; it tells us that one can significantly reduce the risk of transmitting\nBut it also tells us that the quality of the mask matters\n\n\nWhy are we learning this 2 years into the pandemic?\nThe NIH and CDC are not fulfilling their role of providing data to the public\n\nFor two years, with their gigantic budgets, they couldn’t do this basic study on masks\n\n\n\n \nLong COVID and the potential for vaccines to reduce risk [1:21:45]\n\nUCSF has a great study on post-acute SARS COVID 2 sequela\n\nUnderstanding the Long-term Impact of COVID-19 in Adult\nStudy started October 29, 2021\n\n\nThis type of disease can occur with any severe viral infection, including influenza\n It is characterized by lingering symptoms\nThe pathophysiology seems to be twofold\n\n1) In the absence of immunity to the virus, it can go multiple places\n\nIt won’t stay in your body long term like HIV, but it can go multiple places\n\n\n2) In the absence of immunity, the innate immune response can lead to inflammation that lingers\n\n\nWith immunity to the virus (as a result of vaccination or recovery from infection) 2 things happen\n\n1) One develops an adaptive immune response\n\nThe adaptive response responds quickly to a breakthrough infection\nT cell islands in the nose begin to control infection and limit spread of the virus\nThis is why breakthrough infections are mild and up in the upper respiratory tract; immunity limits spread of the virus\nThis is a benefit of being vaccinated or immune\n\n\n2) It’s not the innate immune system that reacts to infection but the adaptive immune response\n\nThis doesn’t’ produce that kind of massive inflammation that can occur before immunity\n\n\n\n\nJust this morning Monica saw a study out of Israel showing that those who are vaccinated don’t get long COVID symptoms after having a mild breakthrough\n\nPreprint available at medRxiv, Association between vaccination status and reported incidence of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms in Israel: a cross-sectional study of patients tested between March 2020 and November 2021 \nIn fact, they have long COVID symptoms at the same rate as people who’ve never had COVID at all\n\nThere’s people who have had a lot of anxiety and depression during this time, understandably, and that can be mistaken for long COVID symptoms\nThere are some studies that what’s going on in the world right now and how miserable everyone is, is making people have less cognitive function because it’s just a miserable time\n\n\nThis was a study of people who had 2 vaccine doses; they had fewer long COVID symptoms than people who never had COVID\nSo basically vaccination both brings your long COVID symptoms in check\nSo getting vaccinated for long COVID is one way to treat long COVID\nAnd then also those who have mild symptomatic breakthroughs who have been vaccinated don’t seem to get long COVID symptoms\n\nNow there are 3 studies showing this, including this one\nAnd we have had a lot of breakthrough infections through Delta and now out through Omicron\n\n\n\n\n\n“These are very good studies that shows our adaptive immunity prevents us from getting these longer symptoms” – Monica Gandhi qkt\nWhat is the incidence of long COVID in presumably the unvaccinated\n\nIt depended on if someone had severe disease or mild disease\nSo those who had severe disease, there is a very good Nature study, they are more likely to get longer symptoms after that\n\nThe incidence was about 30%\nPublished November 2021, Burdens of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 by severity of acute infection, demographics and health status\n\n\nFor those who had mild disease, the incidence was very low\nHowever, at this point there are so many people who’ve been vaccinated and there is so much natural immunity that the long COVID population is going down \nFrom the clinic she knows we’re still treating people who had an initial severe infection before the vaccines were available\n\nWhat portion of the young population is not vaccinated and therefore at risk for long COVID?\n\n15% of Americans over 18 are unvaccinated\n20% of Americans over age 12 are unvaccinated\n\n“Really to me that might be one of the more potentially compelling reasons to be vaccinated if you are otherwise young and healthy is to mitigate the risk and the downside of long COVID” – Peter Attia\n\nNot only does vaccination help someone not get long COVID if they get COVID, but also it seems to be able to treat long COVID \n\nbecause with vaccination, the more dysregulated immunity becomes a more adaptive and organized immunity\n\n\n\n“I think it’s profoundly important to say vaccination helps long COVID, either after the fact or before the fact “ – Monica Gandhi\n\nSo adaptive immunity seems to be the way all roads lead to where we need to get to with this virus, which is having a lot of immunity to the virus\nNow in this stage of the pandemic, we have so much more immunity to the virus\n\n \nRisks for children and policies for schools [1:27:30]\n\nMonica notes that Peter went over how much lower the risk of severe COVID is for children\nThere is a clear mechanism by which children are less likely to get severe COVID— with these two receptors and their native immune response\n\nAnd that’s true of long COVID as well\n\n\nSchools should not be a place of fear\nThere will always be respiratory disease; think of parainfluenza, rhinovirus, influenza\nFew people will deny the ill effects of school closures 2 years into the pandemic\n\nThe ill effects include mental illness, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and learning loss\n\n\nChildren are the most precious resource\nWe need to now move towards normality for children in schools\n\nColleges move toward management of COVID as an endemic not pandemic\n\nHarvard just said, they’re not going to do asymptomatic testing or contact tracing starting in the spring semester, they’re going to have normal college\nJohn’s Hopkins is still not having normal college\nMonica notes that Marty wrote a really poignant piece on the restrictions being placed on college students\n\nPublished January 4, 2022 in Common Sense, Universities’ Covid Policies Defy Science and Reason\n\n\n\n“Harvard of all places saying they’re going to have normal school in the spring semester and accepting that we can’t eradicate a virus, for me, was very hopeful this weekend” – Monica Gandhi\nMonica had to leave but Marty, ZDoggMD, and Peter continue the discussion\n \nReviewing the outcomes from Sweden, where the government didn’t impose lockdowns [1:31:00]\n\n\n\nRemember in spring, summer of 2020, when Sweden didn’t lock down and everybody looked at Sweden as though it was crazy\nPeter has not gone back and looked at Swedish outcomes but wonders what happened\nAnecdotally, ZDoggMD has gotten lots of messages from Swedes\nPeople fail to see the context of the society in Sweden\n\nThis is a Nordic country that over the years has developed a relationship between its population and its government that is trusting\nOne has to consider their healthcare system, their public welfare system, aspects of their population\n\n\nSweden took the tact of less regulation\n\nThere were rules early on about large events and large gatherings\n\n\nBut their public health officials didn’t know when a vaccine was coming  and took a long-game approach, thinking years\nSo they said we cannot shut down schools\n\n\n\n\nEarly on what they found was they did have a higher mortality per capita rate than their neighbors\n\n\nLargely because the one big mistake that was made early on is failing to protect nursing home patients who are the highest risk of mortality in the early days\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, it seemed the data shifted to where there was no excess mortality; it was not higher than their neighbors\n\n\nAnd they actually did quite well\n\n\nOverall, they stayed mostly open\nThey had some businesses that suffered that the government directly stepped in and paid salaries and things like that\n\nSo there was more of a social support network\n\n\nBut they really were playing the long game\n\nAnd it seems like so far, they’ve done quite well\n\n\nMarty agrees, this is a fascinating case study because Sweden took a radically different approach\nThere was criticism of their strategy early on, but nobody has talked about them since\n\nData from Sweden\n\nIt turns out that their data are very impressive\nThe mortality per capita in Sweden, all in all cumulative, this entire pandemic has been 1 in 663\nCompare this to the United States, it’s 1 in 387\n\nThis is a radically different confirmed deaths per capita rate\nThis is according to Statistica \n\n\nThe mortality rate for Sweden falls around the middle\n\nBut remember most of the countries in the bottom half are not reporting reliably\n\n\n\n \nDraconian measures implemented in Canada [1:38:15]\nAnecdotes \n\nPeter has a friend who had COVID and didn’t get vaccinated\n\nTheir kids didn’t get vaccinated\n\n\nWithout vaccination, the kids can’t play sports\nQuebec is now trying to tax the unvaccinated\n\nThis is a sin tax\nTo be logically consistent, a lot of people should be taxed\n\nA tax for having a high BMI\nA tax for being clumsy and doing high risk sports because of the increased risk of ending up in the hospital\n\n\n\n\nAn unvaccinated person in Canada cannot travel in Canada\n\nThey can only drive themselves\nThey can’t get on a bus or airplane\nThey can’t cross the border\n\n\nMarty asks what happens to people infected with influenza or parainfluenza\n\nIs this okay even though the case fatality rate is high?\n\n\nZDoggMD agrees, influenza kills so many people per year\n\n \nAntiviral treatments for COVID and a common-sense approach [1:42:15]\n\nTamiflu doesn’t do much for the flu\nPeter has had the flu twice in his life; it sucks\nThe bad thing is that we can’t really do much about it\nPeter remarks that influenza is about as bad as Omicron\n\nMarty says influenza is worse\nIn a study of 52,000 people infected with Omicron, only 1 died \n\n\nFor COVID there is now Fluvoxamine and the more recently Pfizer’s Paxlovid and Merck’s molnupiravir\n\nWays to protect one’s self\n\n1) Get vaccinated\n2) Have access to therapeutics\n3) Have access to a healthcare system that knows how to treat this disease\n\nPolicies are based on previous variants\n\nPeter notes that we are operating under assumptions that are 2 years old\nMarty adds that we are thinking of the infection fatality rate of the prior virus\n\n“Omicron needs a PR firm because as long as it’s COVID people think they’re using all the COVID historical data” – Marty Makary\n\nWhen you add population immunity and a more mild virus, it does change the calculus\n\nIt doesn’t mean people don’t get sick\nIt doesn’t mean that any of us would ever wish anyone to become infected and deal with this virus\n\n\nEverybody is so upset at the CDC over so-called messaging\n\nOver the time to quarantine\nIs it 1 or 2 tests?\nIs it an antigen or PCR test?\n\n\nLet’s ask the bigger question— why are we even quarantining immune people who are low risk from other immune people? \n\nWould we ever do this for parainfluenza or rhinovirus?\n\n\nWe need to get back to common sense\n\nWhat does common sense look like?\n\nMarty’s pan viral strategy for general public health hygiene\n\nThis will get us away from these crazy deliberations that we’re having right now\n1) Which means if you’ve been exposed, then wear a mask; it doesn’t matter what virus\n2) If you are around someone vulnerable, be careful, maybe stay your distance\n3) And if you’re sick, stay home\n\n\nZDoggMD notes this requires a culture shift\nBecause people have to understand that going into work sick without a mask say is really a taboo\n\n \nImportance of ending tribalism and having rational discussions with humility [1:47:30]\n\nSince the last COVID podcast Peter has been more attentive to all things related to COVID\n\nIt hasn’t been good for him\nHis blood pressure has been running 10 mmHg higher\nMost of that is social media\nHe has this “anaphylactic reaction to things that are logically inconsistent, but it serves no purpose other than to hurt me”\n\n\nHe started trying to understand his agenda\n\nHe’s not a contrarian\n\n\nHe’s worried about the integrity of the medical profession and the broader discipline of science\n\nHe has many friends and some patients who have completely lost faith in this profession\nThis is the ax he’s grinding\nHe’s very upset about what the implications of this are down the line\n\n\nFor ZDoggMD, thinking about COVID since the last podcast has been nothing but suffering\nFrom the early days, his agenda is trying to find a synthesis of what is the best policy versus science thing for the most people and trying to bridge across this divide of misunderstanding and division\n\nHe wants to understand all these positions\nHe calls his agenda the alt middle\n\n\n\n“How do we build those fibers that connect these things together and help us think rationally” – ZDoggMD\n\nIt’s important to understand where our agendas are and where our biases are, whose hive mind has captured us\n\nOtherwise you’ll never be able to bridge these different gaps and have some sanity\n\n\nMarty says his agenda is to end tribalism, because that is the most offensive thing\n\nIt’s not a different opinion\nHe’ll hear somebody articulate a different perspective and they’ll come out entirely differently on what we should be doing or should be recommending\nThat is okay in the context of civility in my mind.\nAnd his thought is, “Let’s show the data on both sides to the best of our ability and let people make a decision”\nOne of the few things that  is morally offensive is the automatic tribalism, the dismissal of people because of something that they thought early on\n\n\nHe sees universities, who ironically are supposed to be champions of data and scientific reason, revert to these primitive practices that are almost barbaric\n\nThey’re definitely cruel on students\n\n\nPeter got a lot of hate mail after the last podcast [1:53:00]\nZDoggMD has been talking about this in the Sensemaking community online, people who are focused on trying to figure out “how do we make sense of the world in a fractured information economy and so on”\n\nSo, David Fuller, Rebel Wisdom, BJ Campbell and other people like that\n\n\nThere’s an idea that individual humans actually do instantiate these higher elements of thinking\nWe call them different things— groupthink, hive mind; he actually calls them egregores, which is a demon that emerges from groups of people and their thinking\nIt used to be in the old days, you would share information in very slow and uniform ways\n\nWhether it was mass media, just a few channels\nOr whether it’s money as a way to exchange information because they’re economic incentives, like you build a city on a river because it’s easy access to ports and so on\n\n\nBut now with social media, it has effectively have turned every human with a smartphone into an addicted machine that behaves like a neuron\n\nAnd its neurotransmitters are likes, dislikes, comments, shares\nSo, each of us is part of a network of people that acts, again, we’re neurons\nAnd we instantiate, through these instant connections, these hive mind groupthink tribes\nInstantly one can be a part of this and then be controlled by it without even knowing it\n\nAnd it’s lubricated by social media\n\n\n\n\nAnd the people who are acting as the neuron in that network don’t even know they’re doing it\n\nThey actually believe this until they really introspect or they talk to you in person or something happens that breaks the spell\n\n\nSo, the Malones of the world are captured by the antithesis groupthink hive mind\nThe Fauci’s, Eric Topol’s of the world are more captured by the thesis hive mind\nAnd who are we in this middle corpus callosum hive mind? \n\nWe’re hated by everyone\n\n\nThe letters that meant the most to Peter were the ones that said, “I have been morally opposed and opposed in every manner to getting vaccinated until I heard this podcast. I actually think I might get vaccinated now”\n\nThat’s worth all the hate mail in the world\n\n\nAnd Peter doesn’t think the purpose of these podcasts is to get everyone vaccinated \n\nIt’s how about to give people the information so they can make the best decision in their best interest\n\n\nBut when someone says, a buddy of mine who’s the most anti-vax human being in the history of civilization, just got vaccinated because of that podcast, Peter thinks, “Wow, that’s fantastic” \n\n“There is hope that information can trump fear” – Peter Attia\n\nMarty thinks the honesty of the conversation is what was appealing\n\n“I think people are starving out there for honesty on this topic that’s not tribal” – Marty Makary\n\nIt’s not an allegiance to a party line on what we have handed down to us as an edict\nMarty thinks it’s this very genuine humility around the data and a virus that changes and evolves\n\nAnd we have to change our thinking in real time\nPeople are starving for honesty and data\n\n\nIt’s important to spend time just explaining things with a non judgemental approach\n\nBy the way, physicians have been doing this our whole careers\n\n\n\n \nTreating infection with monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera [2:01:45]\nWhat monoclonal antibodies are effective against Omicron?\n\nOnly 2 out of the 3 work on the Delta variant\nOver the last few weeks, the people who have been showing up in the hospital in deep trouble medically tend to be heavily skewed towards the remaining Delta variant\nNow, if the CDC estimates are correct, Delta is 1.7% of new cases as of January 14th or so\nThat tells us that the influx, that the ongoing damage that this is causing in terms of severe illness, is really letting up right now just by the dominance of Omicron\nThere is only 1 monoclonal that works well, the GSK monoclonal, sotrovimab\n\nThis is the only one that works well on Omicron\n\n\nBut if Omicron is as mild as we’re seeing, that tells us we should be using it selectively in high risk individuals\n\nWe don’t do a good job of that in healthcare\nInstead what happens is these industrial strength big guns like PAXLOVID and sotiromab are being used in very low risk people, sometimes people with wealth and power and access tend to get it\n\n\n\nFluvoxamine\n\nPeter asks if there is any emerging data on the efficacy of fluvoxamine against Omicron specifically? \n\nBecause obviously the Lancet trial, the JAMA trial were all in Delta\n\n\nMarty replied that someone at the NIH wrote a summary of fluvoxamine where they described its benefit and impact on reducing hospitalizations and survival and concluded, at the end of it, that there was insufficient data to recommend it\n\nThis was a conclusion that should not have been derived from that summary\n\n\nUnfortunately now there is this militaristic mentality where everyone just falls in line in medicine \nMany physicians are creative and smart enough and they’re like, “Hey, I read the studies. The reduction is dramatic. Just because there’s not an official authorization around it at the FDA, I’m going to use it for my patients.”\nAnd then there’s some that just say, “Well, the CDC doesn’t say for me to use it,” or they say, “The NIH is not officially endorsing it.” \n\nSo, they’re up against that \n\n\nThe people who did that study have told ZDoggMD and I that they’re close to what they believe might be some good news at the FDA around an authorization\nBut unfortunately this is a drug that has reduced mortality among people compliant by 91% in high risk COVID patients, and we still have very little awareness around it\nIn fact, a preprint was just released; it was a survey of doctors asking what they recommend for patients just diagnosed with COVID\n\nThey said Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Zinc, and something else with no evidence really behind it\nThere was no discussion of convalescent plasma, which in concentrated form reduces hospitalizations by 50%\n\nThat’s been around, by the way, for 2 years\n\n\nThere was no mention of fluvoxamine\n\n\n\nConvalescent plasma\n\nConvalescent plasma was talked about immensely in March and April of 2020 when we truly had nothing on the horizon and then it went away\n\n\nPeter doesn’t know if it went away because it didn’t have efficacy or because we finally got  monoclonal antibodies\n\n\nMarty talked to the authors of a study on convalescent plasma that was the subject of a recent article in MEDPAGE TODAY\n\nFDA Allows COVID Convalescent Plasma for Some Outpatients— Updated EUA limits scope of treatment to immunocompromised individuals (December 29, 2021)\n\n\nConvalescent plasma is the plasma from someone who recovered from COVID illness\n\nConvalescent means recovered from illness\nThis is the plasma, not the red cells\nThe plasma contains antibodies\nThis is an infusion of a partially intact immune system, real antibodies\n\n\nEssentially, monoclonal antibodies that pharma companies make is the same thing\n\nThey’re just antibodies made in a laboratory and they tend to be all one type, hence the name monoclonal as opposed to polyclonal antibodies\n\n\nSo, in the convalescent plasmas, there is a more diverse antibody profile\n\nArguably this is better\n\n\nMarty thinks the backlash against convalescent plasma is politically driven \n\nThe trump administration had a lot of enthusiasm for it\n\n\nThere was confusion about it\nThe head of the NIH, Francis Collins, was asked to weigh in on convalescent plasma; and he said, “We need a randomized controlled trial” \n\nMarty thinks this was a cop out\nThey had strong data in a non-randomized fashion \n\n\nWe should do a randomized control trial, but what he did is he threw water on any sort of interest in using it clinically\n\nThe news media distorted it\nPharma companies were saying, “Hey, we’re making antibodies. Why use convalescent antibodies?”\nConvalescent plasma fell to the wayside\n\n\nMarty reached out to the study authors of the first trial that showed a benefit, the New England Journal of Medicine, and they said, “That study was flawed. The design was flawed. We need more research and trust us, it’s coming.” \n\nAnd they were very frustrated\nThey eventually published a study that came out very recently that looked at concentrated convalescent plasma\n\nConcentrated convalescent plasma provides more antibodies\nIt was a well done study\nIt showed a dramatic reduction in hospitalization, a reduction by 50%\nBut nobody talks about it\n\n\n\n\nThere are shortages of monoclonal antibodies but nobody is talking about concentrated convalescent plasma\nBut we don’t yet know how effective convalescent plasma will be against Omicron\nIn general, when someone is exposed to a virus, they get a more diverse antibody response or profile than with just a monoclonal infusion\n\nWhy natural immunity is thought to be stronger than vaccinated immunity\n\nThere’s two reasons why people think natural immunity is stronger and more effective than vaccinated immunity\n\n1) Natural immunity produces a more diverse antibody portfolio \n2) Natural immunity is a more mucosal-based immunity; so it’s more on the front lines of defense\n\n\n\n \nReviewing claims made by the controversial Dr. Robert Malone [2:11:15]\n\nZDoggMD thinks of our division around this, into these two churches of Covidian and Covidiot, and Robert Malone is an interesting epiphenomenon\nHe’s a scientist who was involved early on in some of the work on the mRNA technology\n\nIn particular wrapping that mRNA molecule in a lipid particle, in a fat particle, that allows it to be taken up by cells\nHe was working on a HIV vaccine that didn’t generate an immune response, but the technology was there\n\n\nHe was one contributor in a vast chain of contribution that actually led ultimately to where we are now\n\nHis contributions and patents expired a while ago\n\n\nHe bills himself as the inventor of mRNA technology\nHe uses that credibility and also the credibility of working as a consultant in different government entities to make a series of claims about vaccine safety\n\nThat ultimately got him banned from Twitter\nThis got Joe Rogan’s attention, and Rogan then gave him a platform\n\n\nHe has made multiple claims\n\nZDoggMD thinks some are correct, such as giving infinite boosters is not a good idea\nHe questions the financial incentives of pharma and different entities within healthcare to focus on vaccines; this is not unreasonable\nHe downplays the point that there’s lots of money in therapeutics, too\nThose are the main things that I think establish his credentials as a heterodox thinker\n\n\n\nWhere Malone is wrong\n\nBut then every major point that he makes is fundamentally flawed, if not a parroting of an extreme anti-vaccine position on these things\n\nSo, one of the things he says is that PCR is overestimating the number of COVID cases, and that it’s not accurate\n\nThe truth is, it is quite accurate; it’s very sensitive and it’s quite specific\n\n\nFor example, he says, “If we had just provided early treatments in the form of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, monoclonals, et cetera, it is a fact that we would’ve saved 500,000 US lives.” \n\nAnd he provides no data to actually support this\nThere’s no evidence that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin actually do anything that’s compelling\nThat’s still being studied with ivermectin\nBut with hydroxychloroquine it was quite clear\n\n\nHe said that hydroxychloroquine was shown to be active against the original SARS\n\nBut this is a bit misleading because chloroquine inhibited the virus in vitro\nThere are millions of compounds that work in vitro; it was never shown to be anything beyond that\n\n\nHe then discusses that the spike protein that is used in current vaccines by Pfizer, Moderna, et cetera, was never tested for safety\n\nHe then either is deliberately misleading or misunderstands the scientific process with this because that’s what the clinical trials with tens of thousands of people were doing, was showing (that it is safe and effective)\n\n\nThe other thing he says that’s abjectly untrue is that there were no pre- clinical or animal studies on these particular vaccines or mRNA constructs\n\nThese studies are findable\nThis is simply a lie\n\n\n\n\nHe made the claim that hospitals in particular are mis-characterizing COVID cases\n\nNow, this is a claim that actually has some validity in a sense\nHospitals are paid more for COVID patients; so, there is some incentive to up code in a medical billing situation\nIn the early days, they’ve looked at this and it’s not clear that that was happening\nBecause to some degree there’s a fraudulent component there\nHe specifically said there are gunshot victims being coded as COVID patients\n\nAnd by the way, that could be true if a gunshot wound patient has COVID\nIt would be unethical to code it as a COVID patient \n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of COVID deaths [2:17:15] \n\nMarty has the numbers\nThere were 477,000 excess deaths from March 1st to December 21st, 2020\n\n74% of match up with the COVID mortality\n385,000 were due to COVID; there was 477,000 total\n\n\nPeter notes that half a million excess deaths can’t be explained with coding\nZDoggMD notes that some of it may be ancillary effects of lockdowns and so on\n\nBut some of it may be even under-counting of COVID cases, people just dying at home and not being diagnosed\nThere are lots of different potential explanations\n\n\nPeter notes, this begs a question which is, were the people who disproportionately died people who were going to die within the next 2 to 3 years\n\nDoes that imply that there may be a reduction of death in 2022 or 2023\n\n\nZDoggMD replies that this has been discussed quite a bit in online circles\n\nIt’s this dry tinder theory, where people who had a short life expectancy died from COVID\nWe see this every winter in the hospital with the flu\nThat’s why they say pneumonia is the old man’s friend, right? It’s the final thing in a very medically frail person\n\n\nZDoggMD thinks it has this ramification in the sense that how much of the overall suffering under the curve was just expedited by a year \n\nVersus how much it is cutting off five years, 10 years of quality adjusted life years \nThat’s quite high\n\n\nThat then would justify or de-justify certain social policies that have been put in place\n\nVaccine monitoring and vaccine injuries [2:19:45]\n\nRelated to this, Malone asserts that we don’t have good vaccine monitoring at all and asserts that there are lots of vaccine injuries and damage that we are not counting\nHe talks about VAERS, which is really a hypothesis generating system where anybody can report and so on, but he does not talk about PRISM or V-safe or the Vaccine Safety Datalink (read more about them) \n\nThese are very robust vaccine monitoring systems that actually help to catch things like very rare events like the vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia of the Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca vaccine\n\n\nZDoggMD thinks that’s quite misleading to say that\nIt’s good that he’s asking these questions\nMalone is directly misleading when he states that the lipid nanoparticles from the mRNA vaccines concentrate in tissues such as ovaries\n\nTo  explaining things like infertility and menstrual cycle abnormalities in women\nAnd the truth is, the data he’s citing is a rat study where they pounded these rats with super normal levels of this lipid nanoparticle mRNA, and they saw accumulations in various tissues, but no tissue damage, actually\nThis has not been seen in humans\n\n\nThere are menstrual cycle abnormalities, so that’s where he is correct\n\nAnd NIH has actually funded studies on this\nThe speculation on why this may be has been rampant\nSome of it is just with any infection with an immune response, there can be abnormalities in menstrual cycles\nAnd it’s that whole hypothalamic ovarian axis thing that ZDoggMD wishes he understood better\n\n\nHe mentions other things about ivermectin that are incorrect\n\nLike Japan recommending ivermectin for treatment of COVID; they did not\n\n\nHe says that the Chinese were using hydroxychloroquine to great effect early on\n\nAnd he uses that as an example of a reason of why we should be using it\n\nSimply not true\n\n\n\n\nPeter remarks, “those are the types of claims that are difficult because you can’t counter a negative…you can’t search the anti-truth”\nThis is why ZDoggMD thinks many people will not research it\n\nThey constantly want to debate\n\n\n\n“When you actually have days to look at the data, you realize, wow, that’s total bullshit, but I could never have responded that in real time” – ZDoggMD\n\nWhat is needed is an honest debate, a conversation\n\nWhere everyone is familiar with the data\n\n\nThe fact that Malone was deplatformed on these other platforms is why he’s on Rogan\nZDoggMD has no idea what his motivations are\nThe interesting thing to do when judging the veracity of somebody or the credibility of somebody, is to see who they cite\n\nWho Malone cites as reputable sources\n\nAt one point Malone cites Peter Duesberg\n\nHe’s a legendary guy in science because he was an esteemed virologist based out of UC Berkeley\nHe was known for denying that HIV (the virus) caused AIDS\nHe would say things in his German accent like, “AZT is AIDS by prescription” \nHe got famous for this because he went to South Africa and actually convinced the president of South Africa that this might be true\n\nAnd it may well have cost lots of people their lives because they were slow to uptake protease inhibitors, et cetera\n\n\n\n\n So, Malone actually cites Duesberg as the esteemed virologist who was canceled by Fauci in the early days\n\nThis is not true, actually\nDuesberg continued to teach at Berkeley where ZDoggMD took his class; where he presented his ideas and the class got to debate them.\nDuesberg was since proved remarkably wrong on HIV\n\n\nIn the same breath, Malone actually associates with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who is a known anti-vaccine activist, not a physician\nAnd right after Rogan, he went on InfoWars with Alex Jones and started talking about the great reset, various conspiracies along those lines\n\nMass formation psychosis\n\nPeter asks about a term he keeps hearing from that, mass formation psychosis\n\nWhat is this?\n\n\nZDoggMD links this back to the earlier discussion of groupthink and neuronal networks\nAny human now can create information and put it out in the world and form a hive mind around it\nMass formation psychosis is a term based on the work of a European psychologist; ZDoggMD forgets his name\n\nHe parallels it to what happened with Nazi, Germany\n\nWhich again, if he’s resorting to the Nazis, he’s already lost the discussion\n\n\n\n\nMalone wrapped what he said in reason, and in a sense he is correct\n\nMalone said, “The rules for having a mass formation psychosis were the population is hypnotized into believing something to the detriment of actual truth is the following— You need an isolated population where there’s been isolation and dissatisfaction.”\nZDoggMD forgets all the things he listed but he said, “You need a sense of economic destabilization and crisis. You need to silo people off.”\nOne other thing needed is an entity in authority to say, “We have the solution, and it is one solution and that’s it”\nThen Malone’s argument is that “the good German people, who are hyper educated, go and do crazy things”\n\n\nMalone claims, “Now we’re in a situation where the mainstream has created this mass formation psychosis where the only way out, we’re in this dangerous situation, you have to lock down, you have to close schools, you have to shut down your way of life and wear masks. And the solution is just this, vaccines. Forget about therapeutics, forget about ivermectin, forget about monoclonals. It’s just this, and this is the only way out. And people start to believe it because they’re so destabilized from all the other stuff happening. And so, they go along with the mass formation.”\n\n“Where I think he’s correct is that we are all victims of groupthink. What he ignores is that so is he.” – ZDoggMD\n\nMalone is part of the reactionary tribe mind that says, “No, I’m not comfortable with this, and here are all the crazy things we believe” \nZDogg breaks down Malone’s claims in more detail in this recent podcast, Ep. 10: Dr. Robert Malone’s Joe Rogan Interview, Decoded – ZDoggMD\n\n \nA potential exit strategy from the current situation [2:30:30]\n\nPeter takes some comfort in what Monica presented, which was that, in the spring, colleges might say, “You don’t have to wear masks to sit in class anymore” \n\nThat would be fantastic for young people, for every person\nIf airplanes, if the TSA and airlines say you no longer have to wear masks\n\n\nMarty thinks in a matter of a month or two, there are going to be very low levels of Omicron around\n\nAlmost nobody left who’s not already had it or strong immunity\nAnd he thinks people are going to be so giddy to move on that the fatigue is just going to hit all time highs and people are going to turn the page\n\n\n\n“And I think you’re going to see a sentiment really flip in most of the country” – Marty Makary\n\nRemember when the opioid epidemic was nightly news every night, and we all were in touch with it\n\nAnd then overnight, in one day, the media shifted their attention\nAnd it was almost as if within 24 hours people forgot we even had an opioid epidemic\n\n\nMarty thinks there’s going to be an even bigger flip pretty soon\n\nWill new variants become the norm every winter?\n\nPeter asks, “we’re going to either have Omicron come back next winter, or we’re going to have Epsilon show up next winter. And presumably case rates will be high again, and mortality and hospitalizations will be relatively low. But what will prevent us from backsliding into a state of panic?”\nMarty thinks the reaction will depend on geography\n\nThe reaction to the current pandemic was vastly different in Florida versus New York City\n\n\n10% to 25% of the public is going to get some respiratory infection almost every year in perpetuity\n\nThat’s the way respiratory pathogens work\n\n\n\n“But we’re definitely going to see more variants” – Marty Makary\n\nAre we going to realize what Monica was describing— that is the beautiful, amazing, gorgeous immune system of the human body (adaptive immunity) will increase our protection against future variants regardless of what they are\n\nMarty thinks there may be some anxiety, but at some point people are going to believe in adaptive immunity\n\n\n\nImplications for vaccine mandates\n\nSo, there’s not going to be a federal mandate, but states and employers, universities, where is that going to go? \nZDoggMD thinks this is an issue where we need discussions\nWhat is the incremental value now of mandating vaccines?\nVinay Prasad talks about this, he says, “How many people are actually at risk of high complications? And of those, how many are unvaccinated? And of those, how many will mandates actually reach them?” \n\nZDoggMD thinks the answer is probably much less than one might think\n\n\nThese shotgun mandates that affect a lot of people and are polarizing society more along these like peri-religious lines\nZDogg agrees with what Monica was saying, now at this point in the pandemic it’s an individual choice\n\nOne can vaccinate, one can wear a mask or not, and one can take the precautions that they need to\n\n\n\n“Omicron will be the great equalizer that immunizes a lot of people, and we’ll then be on the other side of this where we don’t need mandates and policy stuff” –  ZDoggMD\n\nZDogg sees the need for these conversations but notes, “even opening your mouth about it is taboo within certain hive mind states. I think it also requires a degree of thick skin.”\nSince the last podcast Peter doesn’t know why, but he finds himself having much more empathy for people who don’t see eye to eye with him on vaccines, who are anti-vax\n\nEven though he doesn’t agree with them scientifically, and he don’t agree with the facts that they cite in some circumstances\n\n\nPeter reserves the right to say, “maybe one day a pathogen will come along that is so deadly for which there is no treatment for which transmission is eliminated by a vaccine, and for which the vaccine is so incredibly safe, where I might change my mind….and say we’re going to have to mandate this shit.”\n\nBut he can’t say this with the current set of facts\n\n\nZDoggMD notes that explaining what would convince him to do something shows nuanced thinking that is different from a hardcore anti-vax person who’s just that conditioned,or even a pro-vax person\nThe difference is talking about a real belief based thing instead of strong convictions loosely held\n\nWhat would dislodge convictions of belief?\n\n\nMarty adds that when one sees how the decision making is made at a government level\n\nAt the absurdity of how they’ve brushed over the data\nHow there’s this bandwagon effect, how the leadership has been dismissive of some of the data and cherry picking other data\nHe sees this attitude of “You’re stupid. Don’t ask questions. Just do it.” and that’s not how people are wired\n\n\nMarty worries about our response to another pandemic \n\nOne that has a case fatality rate not of two-tenths of 1% (which is probably retrospectively what it’s panning out to be with COVID)\nAn infection with a case fatality rate of 5%\n\nSpanish Flu had a case fatality rate of 2%\nEbola has a case fatality rate of 50%\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens when we get a virus with a case fatality rate of truly 10%,  and we are acting like this sort of dysfunctional tribal, big tech censored…\n\nThis is what we were worried about from the early reports of China\nWe might be hosed\n\n\n\n“We’ve got to have an NIH that responds in seven days with bedside clinical trials to tell us what’s happening, what works, what’s effective” – Marty Makary\n \nChanges needed at the NIH [2:40:00]\n\nPeter asks, “What are the ethics of having the people at the top of the NIH be both in charge of funding any academic in this country, and yet also being the arbitraries of what is appropriate to be said and not to be said?”\n\nThink of careers being ruined\nThink about people who are now being silenced and not permitted to say anything that is at odds with the narrative of their funder\n\n\n\n“Science has a currency of objectivity” – Peter Attia\n\nScientific freedom is a key component of actually being able to do science because science isn’t a dogma; it’s a process\nPeter relates it to the movie Don’t Look Up on Netflix; it was depressing because it was so accurate\n\nFear and undue focus on how questions and commentary is perceived\n\nMarty agrees, he’s had so many doctors tell him exactly what Peter just described\n\nThey’ve  been threatened\nThey’ve  been bullied by the media relations department at their hospital\nTheir department chair directly told them, “Don’t put this out. Don’t write this op-ed.”\n\n\nMany people have told him they believe natural immunity confers a lot of protection\nMany people believe in spacing out the second doses to save more lives and give better durability to the immunity\nPeople believe in open schools, that cloth masks don’t work\nBut many people feel they can’t say anything\n\nThey encourage Marty to “keep going, keep being out there and saying things”\n\n\nWhen he looks at this national dialogue, he recognizes the one common theme people say is that their local institutions are concerned how it could be perceived\nMarty notes that “Twitter is now the ultimate arbitrator of whether or not institutions are willing to put things out”\nThe other thing he hears is people are worried about their NIH funding\n\nAnd if there is one currency of academic medicine, it is NIH funding\nIt is a direct requirement for every step of the promotions process\n\n\nHe thinks people are afraid to go against Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins\n\nThat is a tremendous amount of power concentrated in one human being, Dr. Fauci, and it’s even magnified because he’s such a nice gentleman\nHe has too much influence; it’s too concentrated\nIt’s not that he is bad or diabolical\nMarty actually thinks he’s very well intended, he just disagrees with him on almost every aspect of the strategy\nIt’s just too much concentration of power, especially with when he controls the NIH funding dollars\n\n\n\nAnecdote about NIH not funding studies that go against the grain\n\nMarty just heard from a doctor who has been funded by the NIH for 30 years \nHe tells Marty that he submitted a very elegant and extensive grant to study natural immunity\nThe grant got a near perfect score, and it’s not been funded\nThat’s the kind of thing that should deserve funding and to get an answer\nThe NIH has $42 billion at their disposal; that’s one question that deserves an answer rather than saying “we don’t know”\n\nWhat studies have been funded?\n\nPeter asks, “How many studies have been funded by the NIH that look at disparities in COVID rates”\nMarty’s team just put out a Preprint analyzing 254 studies looking at COVID research on health disparities and social disparities\n\nAvailable on medRxiv December 11, 2021, NIH Funding of COVID-19 Research in 2020: a Cross Sectional Study \n\n\nThere has been 1 prevalence study; the results aren’t available yet, and it’s outdated anyway\nThe other question is how does the virus spread? \n\nThe NIH funded 4 studies on that\n\n\nThe question of the effectiveness of masks— 1 study has been funded\nOf the 254 grants the NIH put out there on social and health disparities in COVID, 4 are on how it spreads and 1 is on masks\nMarty notes, “If you agree with me, you should be offended that Princeton is testing people three times a week even though they’re asymptomatic and triple vaxed. You talk about a disparity. High risk people in the community or can’t get a test when they’re sick and vulnerable, and yet we’re testing the hell out of these young, healthy, triple vax people.”\n\n“But how about knowing how it spreads?” – Marty Makary\n\nBecause we were propagating surface transmission for way too long\nPeter adds that we need to understand the natural history of the disease is vis a vis the immune system in the people who were infected without a vaccine\n\nFinal comments \n\nZDogg defends Fauci from a piece that ran in The New York Post where his finances were disclosed\n\nZDogg took personal offense to this\nThe guy is 80 and so what if he saved his money and happened to believe in the power of compounding and very generic mutual funds\nIt’s not like he owns Pfizer directly or something\n\n\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialPrevious podcast with Marty and Zdogg on COVID-19: Podcast #189 – COVID-19: Current state of affairs, Omicron, and a search for the end game | Host Peter Attia, The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (January 3, 2022) | [1:30]\nJoe Rogan’s podcast with Dr. Robert Malone: #1757 – Dr. Robert Malone, MD | Host Joe Rogan, The Joe Rogan Experience (December 2021) | [2:45] \nOmicron cases in Kaiser hospitals in southern California suggests less severe disease: Clinical outcomes among patients infected with Omicron (B.1.1.529) SARS-CoV-2 variant in southern California | medRxiv (JA Lewnard et al.
