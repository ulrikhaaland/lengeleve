He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

[44:15]; Imprinting stress to your kids epigenetically [48:00]; The role of stress on memory and the consequences of hypercortisolemia [53:00]; The impact of subjective socioeconomic status and social media on stress levels and health [57:45]; Tips for managing stress in the modern world [1:13:15]; What Robert learned about himself studying the social behavior of baboons [1:25:30]; The multilayered factors behind every human behavior, the context of “good and bad”, and exploring the human capacity of the wild extremes of violence and altruism from moment to moment [1:30:15]; PMS: How two women with identical hormone levels can have completely different emotional experiences [1:34:45]; How much of a role do genes play in depression and other emotional states? [1:38:00]; Why is cortisol elevated under sleep deprivation? [1:46:00]; The impact of stress on cancer [1:50:30]; The impact of stress on atherosclerosis, dementia, addiction, and depression [1:57:00]; Impulsiveness, impaired judgment, and lack of empathy in times of stress [2:01:45]; What advice would Robert give his 25-year-old self?

We’re not ready\nSam’s worried that after we come out of this, we will eventually fall back asleep on it until it blindsides us again\n\nPeople are having a tough time grasping the magnitude of the situation\n\nSam has spent a lot of time trying to convince smart people to take this seriously\nBut there really is no good analogy to this situation\n“It’s just been very interesting to see the layers of denial and obfuscation present themselves and to have to kind of punch through them. . . .it’s just psychologically, it’s very interesting to watch.”\n\nThe challenge of communicating this crisis to the public\n\nPeter says the communication has been too binary — e.g., people saying we “know” this or that will happen\nA better way to communicate things that would less alienating to the people who are naturally skeptical would be to use confidence intervals — e.g., “we’re 90-95% sure that this or that will happen”\n\n \nWhy comparing COVID-19 to influenza is a bad analogy [10:45]\n\nMany people have been outwardly comparing this to the seasonal flu to sort of downplay the crisis\nBut Sam and Peter say this is not a good analogy\nNobody is discounting the severity of influenza\nHowever, influenza comes in a very predictable wave and the infection and mortality is spread out over the course of a year\nBut CV is still in exponential growth in new cases and there’s no evidence yet that we are on the back side of that curve where that has stabilized\nAnd we don’t yet know what the absolute potential for mortality from coronavirus really is because it’s still in its infancy\nIf we could somehow “freeze” the new cases in their tracks, this CV situation would indeed look way less harmful compared to the flu\nSo the point is… what steps can we take to freeze this thing from spreading?\n\n \nThe impact on the economy of measures like shelter-in-place—Is the “cure” worse than the disease? [16:45]\n\nIt’s hard to say what we could do differently to protect the economy without a vaccine\nThere are many people that are really worried about how the “lock down” or “shelter in place” strategy might crush the economy and lead to a depression\nSam says many of the policymakers are also concerned but may not be expressing it properly\nAt the same time, nobody is saying there’s nothing to worry about from an economic standpoint\nSam is concerned that people aren’t fully grasping the importance of stamping down the spread of this virus\nSam also acknowledges that even after just one week, the “shelter in place” order is beginning to unwind as people grow more restless \nAnd this fact makes it pretty clear that the idea that sheltering for weeks, much less months, is a farfetched idea\n\nWhy haven’t we been able to communicate this idea of shelter in place to eradicate this virus? \nHow long would it take?\n\nIt will be very hard to enforce “stay at home” in a free society like the US\nBut Sam doesn’t feel like this idea that it will take a few weeks and we could nearly eradicate the virus hasn’t been communicated properly\nPeter says it would likely take about 4 weeks of total lockdown to burn this thing out\n\n \nWhy are some places, like New York, getting hit so much worse? [24:45]\nSee this video by Peter that explains why NY is in a dire situation and why we can’t think of Italy or the US as a whole:\n<iframe title=\"#COVID19 Video #9 (3/23/20)—Detailed update of our assessment today\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2EK-XRBsSo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIt’s important to understand that even within Italy, the statistics are drastically different among areas (Milan vs. Rome vs. Sicily)\nNew York is looking to be in a much more dire situation compared to other cities in the US\nEven with the most conservative estimates, Peter says it’s unlikely that NY will not get overwhelmed with ICU cases\nWhy? \n\nNY got a bad head start (i.e., they pumped the brakes too late)\nThey live in close quarters\nLots of public transit \n\n\n\n“We think that there needs to be a really important strategy of mitigation in New York and that every other city like Miami, like San Francisco, like Los Angeles and like Seattle who are next in the cross hairs, needs to be pushing the brakes a little harder.”\n \nThe trickle down effect of an overrun healthcare system on non-COVID related health issues [34:45]\n\nWhen the healthcare system gets overwhelmed, other health issues people have may also go untreated potentially leading to death\nIn Peter’s practice, there are patients needing blood work done but won’t get it for some indefinite period\nLess drastic things like root canals and other more minor procedures will be affected as well\nTip: Be careful not to get injured because you won’t want to have to go to an urgent care for treatment and risk getting and spreading CV\n\n \nHow to calm our minds and manage our emotions during this craziness [38:00]\n-Many people are experiencing elevated stress, anxiety, and fear at this moment\n-How does Sam handle this?\n“If you understand the mechanics of your own mental suffering, if you understand how anxiety arises from the first person side. . . just actually able to witness it as a matter of experience, moment to moment, that allows you to get off the ride whenever you can remember to.”\n-Sam says it starts with being able to recognize your thoughts and emotions and suffering\n\nThe recognition is a skill that needs to be learned\nThen it needs to be practiced\nOvertime you become more skilled\nIt’s not that you can stop negative feelings from arising…\n…It’s that you can drastically shorten the amount of time it takes to untether yourself from them\n\n“You want to feel fear when it’s appropriate and useful to feel it and you want to be able to release it the moment there is no point to it.”\n \nTalking to kids about this situation without burdening them with undue stress [50:15]\nSam practices honesty as a core ethic in his home\n\nBut just because you are not lying to your kids, it doesn’t mean you have to tell them everything\nIf his daughter, for example, were to ask a question for which the answer will cause her to be anxious…\n…”I’ll basically just acknowledge in that moment that there’s a door that’s locked that she’s trying to open, but there’s no point in opening it. I’ll tell her what she needs to know there. And that’s not the same thing as saying, ‘Oh, there’s nothing to worry about’ or giving her some dishonest answer.”\n\n“It’s a stronger foundation for a relationship . . . because she knows now that when I say something is not worth worrying about. . .she knows I’m not bullshitting her.”\n \nInsights from meditation practice—Recognize and unhook yourself from a heightened emotional state [52:00]\n\nSam says that he isn’t immune to getting emotional or angry or letting emotions get a hold of him\nThe difference is… \nThrough mindfulness practice, Sam has the ability to “put on the brakes and get off the ride” quickly\n\n⇒ Waking Up App\n \nHow to make the most of a situation where you let your emotions get the best of you [59:15]\n\nPeter recently shared on social media an embarrassing moment where he lost his temper on his kids and felt subsequent shame about it\nSam points out that you can turn moments where you screw up into a positive\nThat feeling of shame could serve an important purpose\nFor example, that feeling of shame might compel you to give a sincere apology\nThat apology could then show your kids that it’s okay to sometimes lose control of your emotions as long as you recognize when it happens and try to improve it\n\n \nWhat are some potential positive things that Sam hopes could be learned from this crisis and applied to the future? [1:09:30]\n\nSam is hopeful that this crisis might help separate out the experts from the rest who might be just making stuff up\nHe hopes that the anti-vaccine community will recognize the importance of vaccinations and perhaps slow the anti-vax movement\nHe’s hopeful that people will start to place more value in the scientific community who are invaluable in moments like the present\nSam hopes that people (especially those with extreme libertarian views) will recognize the essential role of government \nPeter adds that he hopes people will see that a public-private partnership is essential\nPeter also says he’s optimistic that in the future, cities will take on some more of  the risk stratification and planning such that they aren’t waiting on the federal government or the CDC\nOverall, Sam is hopeful that we’ve learned many lessons from the many things that have gone wrong in this crisis so that WHEN it happens again, we are more prepared\n\n \nThe unfortunate politics being layered on top of this crisis [1:15:30]\n\nSam says that the political layering has distorted everything\nSam uses the example of the controversy around the term “Chinese virus”\nSam says many are caught up in criticizing the president for using this term\nAnd the president is surely using the term to bait his opponents into getting caught up in it\nBut the reality is that this virus did originate in China\nAnd it was born of bizarre and unacceptable cultural practices of eating bats\nAnd the Chinese authoritarian government did conceal the gravity of this outbreak and failed to give the world adequate warning\nHowever, Democrats might be right to be worried about how Chinese people might be treated because most of them have nothing to do with this and are equally horrified by the practice of eating bats\n\n“You can hold these truths in buffer simultaneously and not be deranged by it, but we don’t have a politics, or a journalistic community, frankly, that is showing much aptitude for that.”\n \nThe challenge of creating a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 [1:20:00]\n\nThis is harder to vaccinate that things like polio, measles, or smallpox \nThe coronaviruses behave a bit more like RSV viruses which, to create enough immunity, you have to create a larger exposure\nAnd the risk of the vaccine is higher—anytime you vaccinate somebody there’s a risk that they get sick from the vaccine\nThe perfect vaccine would be the vaccine for which you have no risk from the vaccine and you get perfect immunity…\n…But the reality if you may never get there\nIn discussions with virologists, Peter says “we have to sort of caveat our optimism around how long it will take to make a vaccine for this and how safe it will be.”\n“This mirrors the type of virus for which vaccines have historically not been a great alternative because of the risk reward trade off.” says Peter\nThis brings up the important point that we have to be able to discuss this stuff openly and not get bogged down in unreasonable positions\n\nI.e., the anti-vax movement which is largely based on a retracted paper\n\n\n\n§<img width=\"345\" height=\"316\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-24-at-11.52.38-AM.png\" class=\"section--guest__image img--circle alignright\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-24-at-11.52.38-AM.png 345w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-24-at-11.52.38-AM-300x275.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" />Sam Harris, Ph.D.Sam Harris is the author of five New York Times bestsellers and the host of the Waking Up Podcast.
