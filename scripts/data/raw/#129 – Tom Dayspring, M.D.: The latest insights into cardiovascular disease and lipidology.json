In this episode, Tom discusses the growing consensus that atherogenic lipoproteins are essential drivers of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Tom further emphasizes apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). He provides insights into risk assessment, including which lab metrics to use, how to interpret them, and the appropriate therapeutic targets. Additionally, Tom discusses the most recent developments in lipid-lowering drug therapies—from the continued evolution of PCSK9 inhibitors, to the latest understanding of EPA and DHA, and the most recent addition of bempedoic acid to the list of  therapeutic agents.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#129 - Tom Dayspring, M.D.: The latest insights into cardiovascular disease and lipidology\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#129 - Tom Dayspring, M.D.: The latest insights into cardiovascular disease and lipidology\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#129 - Tom Dayspring, M.D.: The latest insights into cardiovascular disease and lipidology\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nThe latest in the field of lipidology and cardiovascular disease [3:45];\nApolipoproteins—the key to understanding lipid biology [9:30];\nApoB as a preferred metric over LDL-P [16:30];\nTherapeutic goals for apoB concentration [21:45];\nDrivers of atherosclerosis [34:15];\nOverview and current thinking on high density lipoproteins (HDLs)—Is it a useful metric?

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

Lipoprotein carriers of apoB.\n \nApoB as a preferred metric over LDL-P [16:30]\n\nPeter switched to ApoB in practice due to consistency factor  \n\nHad used LDL-P, but went through 3 technologies (2 generations of NMR plus electrophoresis)\nelectrophoresis most accurate, but problematic when don’t know what comparing it to –  1st generation NMR (probably still used by many commercial labs) is inaccurate compared to 2nd generation NMR, but those percentiles are still what we use to understand where someone lies\nWith diagnostics, it matters where the reference range is and if you’re moving it \n\n\nWe can’t always use the same lab, so apoB a better thing to measure\n\nPick your favorite metric and stick with it (Peter and Tom both use ApoB)\nFor all biomarkers, try to use the same lab and assay\nApoB assay is commonly available and doesn’t vary widely like NMR \n\n\nAll guidelines talk about ApoB and get you fewer false positives when using ApoB\nAs NMR got better, we started to see unexplained discordance between LDL-P and ApoB \n\nPeter says 2nd gen NMR is almost too sensitive, seeing discordance that exceeded predicted discordance, so started using ion mobility assay\n\n\nAlso economic reason – not expensive to measure ApoB (in Canada, $3-4), so that’s not an excuse\n\nAllan Sniderman just mentioned the cost of ApoB assays in a paper – it’s no longer true that it’s prohibitively expensive\n\n\n\n \nTherapeutic goals for apoB concentration [21:45]\nSmoking and hypertension are two biggest risk factors for CVD, and both seem to do so by creating an injury to the endothelium. \nBut are we sure that it’s apoB-bearing particles in presence of injured endothelium that begins this destructive process of taking cholesterol into the injured space and creating inflammatory response that results in so much damage?\n\nPeter’s patient (woman in late 60’s): TC 300, LDL 220, apoB 170, and her CAC is zero, not treated with any lipid lowering therapy \nNot all smokers get lung cancer – why not?  Have to individualize risk factors.\n\nParticle number is usually a major factor but not always\nEndothelial function matters, but it’s hard to measure\nMore and more, we see it’s not just particle concentration but also quality.  Look at other components: other proteins that are on them, complex lipidome, etc. Maybe in you, a given particle concentration is more worrisome than in another person. \n\n\nAtherosclerosis is a multi-complex, multifactorial disease. Don’t just get a patient’s numbers down – focus on other things that might be injuring the endothelium of artery wall \n\nIs there a limit to the benefit of reducing numbers?  Diminishing returns or even harm?\n\nPeter has talked about this with Ron Krauss before. The causal relationship between ApoB and atherosclerosis is as strong as anything we see in medicine (for which we can’t do a perfect experiment)\nBut it might not be clear what dose/response looks like—What do we know about risk reduction in lowering from 60 to 40 to 20, both pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically (e.g., in Mendelian randomization studies)? \nIn studies we come across the concept that lower is better — That said, you do need a few apoB-containing lipoproteins because they traffic other lipids, but hypobetalipoproteinemia is not a problem like abetalipoproteinemia.\nStudies suggest getting a 50% reduction as the most “bang for your buck” — Beyond that, you do get an incremental reduction, but it’s a much smaller increment of risk reduction. \nAnd there’s no signal of harm with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i), we are routinely seeing patients who can get apoB into the 20-40 mg/dL range.\n\nHow much of our cholesterol is in circulating lipoproteins vs. in cell membranes? \n\nPlasma glucose represents a tiny fraction of total body glucose. Likewise, plasma cholesterol is a small portion of total body cholesterol (most is in the cell membrane or steroidal producing tissue and the circulating amount is a very narrow part of it).  When measure total body cholesterol in plasma, (say 200 mg/dL down to 100), have not cut cholesterol half, only cut the amount carried by lipoproteins in plasma by half\nWe have total body cholesterol: brain (separate system that not discussing today), all peripheral cells, or circulating in plasma\n\nWithin plasma: a tiny amount bound to albumin, more within lipoproteins (apoB and ApoA), and red blood cells (RBCs), which carry more cholesterol than all of your lipoproteins put together\nThe amount of cholesterol in lipoproteins has no correlation with the amount in cells or RBCs\nModulating lipid cholesterol metrics says nothing about cellular cholesterol content.  Don’t worry if LDL cholesterol is low – still have plenty.  You have de novo synthesis, put in cell membrane or other organelles, and if steroidogenic tissue the body can produce a little more.  Under low LDL-C circumstances, no cell is being deprived of cholesterol \n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13790\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-8-tom-1024x666.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-8-tom-1024x666.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-8-tom-300x195.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-8-tom-768x500.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-8-tom-1536x999.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-8-tom-2048x1332.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 8.

It comes in only once there is damage. \n \nOverview and current thinking on high density lipoproteins (HDLs)—Is it a useful metric? [37:00]\nHistory\n\n1950s to late 1970s: Ancel Keys postulated an association between lipids and CAD, identified the relationship in an early study, and then established the association with a large study involving multiple countries. The top and bottom 10% serum cholesterol groups have big differences in atherosclerosis. \nEarly 1980s: scientists just starting to talk about subfractionation of cholesterol (different densities)\nLate 1970s and into 1990s: HDL emerged as a contrast to LDL. Jerry Reaven was starting to identify metabolic syndrome (then called syndrome X). Higher levels of HDL cholesterol were associated with the syndrome \n\n“Folks, there’s one cholesterol molecule. …  If I drew you the structure of cholesterol it’s identical. How dare we put an adjective on it like that’s “good” and that’s “bad”?  How do you know?  You don’t.  So they’re silly terms.” —Tom Dayspring\nIt’s ridiculous to call HDL “good” and LDL “bad” – cholesterol molecules are the same.  But why was HDL considered so important when now it’s an afterthought?  All current risk algorithms still use HDL as a risk-determining metric, but it’s 40-50 years old\n\nAll those studies were never adjusted for anything else – turns out that most people with low HDL cholesterol also have high apoB, which is what’s driving atherosclerosis\nUse HDL-C to figure out lipid component of overall risk, but no trial has ever shown there is CV benefit to changing HDL numbers \n\nMultiple trials have used technical approaches to raise HDL number, but at best those trials (as well as Mendelian randomization trials) have shown it is neutral and at worst harmful.\nOne can have high HDL-C and plaque or low HDL-C and not much risk.  The metric HDL cholesterol by itself is useless. It’s measuring the concentration of cholesterol within HDL particles but tells you nothing about the functionality of that particle. \n\nAllan Sniderman and Ron Krauss have said that the relationship of LDL biology to risk is relatively simple – all you have to do is lower it.  It’s the HDL biology that’s really complicated.  HDL is what the 21st century will be about\n\nWe need a test for HDL functionality, which may be beyond the scope of labs. You can measure apoB and LDL – the more you have, the more problems you have. With HDL, the problem is way harder and we don’t have a clue what we’re talking about \n\n\nWe use lab metrics to figure out what a given biomarker tells us and what to do, but HDL-C is the only available metric – can also get an HDL particle count, but it’s not particularly useful beside the metric.\nHDL must perform some function in the body, maybe preventing plaques or “putting out arterial wall plaque fires,” but how can we measure its functionality?  HDLs are like fire engines, but fire departments have many kinds of trucks that all supply something different. What type of truck do we need at a scene?  Depends on the scene.  \n\nWhat do HLDs do?\n\nThey traffic some amount of cholesterol, but may be just to make it spherical so other things can attach.  HDLs are tiny and don’t carry much cholesterol.  The average size HDL particle carries about 45 cholesterol molecules, while the average LDL carries 1500-2000\nIf HDL is carrying extra TG, it can’t carry much cholesterol.  If HDLs have different surface phospholipids or proteins, all have apoA-I, but what else are they carrying? Those proteins have a multitude of functions.  \nDan Rader used to tell Tom that HDLs are part of the innate immune system – little fire engines carrying things that go into areas with inflammation. Maybe they carry immunomodulatory functionality molecules, or maybe they inflame it further.\n\n\n150 different proteins might be scattered on various HDL subpopulations.  In our lifetime there might never be an affordable, reproducible, high-throughput way of evaluating this.  It’s so complicated and it could be doing both positive and negative things with cholesterol.  The HDL function panel will consist of dozens of tests, but we won’t do the research and no one will pay for them.\nPeter says we do not know what to do with existing HDL panels.  Peter doesn’t even look at apoA-I anymore: looks at VLDL (as proxy for remnants), TG, ApoB, Lp(a), and metabolic markers– glucose, insulin, homocysteine, uric acid, BP, etc. \nTom says HDL panels are being offered to generate revenue – they’re hocus pocus. They are reporting HDL size, but you can have 1-5 molecules of ApoA-I on each HDL, so it doesn’t tell you much.  Compared against ApoB, ApoA-I contributes nothing \nNeed research on HDL functionality.   Would love to test flux of HDL: how do they mature, fill with cholesterol, what do they do with cholesterol?  Are they catabolized or not catabolized?   Are HDLs pulling cholesterol out of the artery wall?  Do they then share with an LDL that puts it right back into the artery? But right now, don’t waste your money, time, or brain energy on figuring out HDL metrics. \n\n \nLipoprotein(a)—the most dangerous particle you’ve never heard of [55:00]\nLp(a) resources:\n\nPrevious podcasts covering Lp(a): Part 5 with Tom Dayspring, AMA #15, and Deep Dive: Lp(a) \nPeter hopes to have Sam Tsimikas, an expert on Lp(a), on the podcast in the near future.\n\n***\nOverview of Lp(a)\n\nAbout 1 in 10 people have an elevated Lp(a), which is the greatest genetic driver of atherosclerosis\nSome people have heart attacks young, and generally it’s Lp(a) until proven otherwise\nEveryone needs to find out if they’re a high Lp(a) carrier (See Anahad O’Connor’s NYT story about Lp(a) carriers)\nWe might not learn much more about HDL, but we’re just scratching the surface of Lp(a) with Mendelian trials providing evidence of Lp(a) being dangerous\n\nStructure of Lp(a)\nLDL is cholesterol, TG, and phospholipids wrapped by a single molecule of ApoB.  The subclasses are heterogeneous.  \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13793\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-11-tom-1024x808.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"808\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-11-tom-1024x808.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-11-tom-300x237.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-11-tom-768x606.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-11-tom.png 1344w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 11.

Relationship between Lp(a) and apo(a)\n\nWhile we’re waiting to get him on the podcast, you can follow the work of Sam Tsimikas on twitter (@Lpa_Doc)  \nNew European guidelines say have an Lp(a) test once in your life. It’s a genetically determined marker, you either have it or not.  But first let’s do a good CV risk assessment no matter what your numbers are. This test should be part of history and work up \n\nWhat do you do for someone with high Lp(a)?\n\nThe strategies are mostly attacking apoB or other factors (Drugs in pipeline may stop liver from making apo(a))\nIf Lp(a) is elevated and problematic in a patient (which shows up in family history – e.g., lots of heart attacks before age 60 – and is not subtle), this is the only strategy.\nThe Journal of the American College of Cardiology recently published a study and an editorial – looked at people with bad family histories and who had issues with Lp(a) or not\n\nIt concluded that high Lp(a) is a problem, and bad family history a problem, but having both is the worst. \nThe best advice is to choose healthier parents! (wink wink)\n\n\nIf a patient has high Lp(a) and a bad family history or positive CAC, etc., historically we’d lower all other risk factors (apoB and metabolic parameters like BP, uric acid, homocysteine, etc.) to the extent possible. \n\nWhat if we could control the liver’s ability to make apo(a)?\n\nThis is very early in the pipeline, but the idea is the following:\nCould we mess with genes and stop cells from making apo(a)?  \nThen there would be no Lp(a) particles.  \nInhibiting synthesis would be good, but what if that has a downside and screws up something else?  \nDrugs are in early development now and will get better over subsequent generations\nWe must invest many millions up front, need first trial to work so will only use sicker patients like those with previous MI or stroke and really high Lp(a). \nIt takes 3-5 years to show efficacy and safety, then subtrial analysis, then will anyone even fund a primary prevention trial?  \nYou’re going to wait 5-10 years, and not for prevention \n\nUntil 5 years ago, statins were the most potent drugs to lower LDL (and apoB), but they have virtually no effect on Lp(a).  \nSo how are the latest PCSK9 inhibitors able to lower Lp(a)?\n1) There are enough trials to show that risk depends on your apo(a) makeup – do you produce low or high molecular weight apo(a)?  Smaller molecular weight apo(a) seems to be more associated with atherosclerosis, allowing the liver to produce more and thus a high particle count. Statins can induce synthesis of the smaller apo(a) but do not affect synthesis of larger apo(a) moiety. (Even Sam Tsimikas will say don’t worry about statins raising Lp(a) – it’s a minority LDL particle.) Statins are still lowering the LDLs that matter clinically \n2) PCSK9i don’t have an effect on the synthesis of apo(a) in the body, but we’re still trying to understand how Lp(a) particles are catabolized and cleared; it’s probably by multiple receptors.  You get more LDL receptors with PCSK9i than a statin can. PCSK9i reduce the catabolism of apoB receptors and 3-4 other lipoprotein-clearing receptors, so on PCSK9i you get better clearance of particles than you do with LDL receptor expression mediated by statins (or statins plus another drug). Most of the time we use a stain plus a PCSK9i unless the patient can’t tolerate a statin. We still don’t have a lot of information about clearance of Lp(a) particles\n\nIn Peter’s practice, he sees 0-70% reduction in Lp(a) in patients on PCSK9i.  This is a very broad range and the median reduction is maybe by a third\nBut keep in mind that Lp(a) is not an acceptable goal of therapy yet because there is no trial data to support it, so we are not making therapeutic decisions based on Lp(a) concentration\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13798\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-16-tom-1024x786.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-16-tom-1024x786.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-16-tom-300x230.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-16-tom-768x589.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-16-tom.png 1392w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 16.

ApoC-III promotes inflammation.\nIf he could only have one lipid concentration, Tom would pick LDL-TG level instead of LDL cholesterol level. (He’d really take ApoB, but that is a lipoprotein metric, not a lipid metric) \nThe TG part of any lipoprotein has a lot to do with plasma residence time, what else is attached, or even something like what Dan Rader calls “fat” HDLs – not carrying many cholesterol molecules but carrying TGs. Dan has discussed how TG-rich HDLs act differently \n\nIf TGs get into LDL, it has a great affinity for lipase enzymes that are looking for TGs. It binds to it and hydrolyzes TGs, and now you have small LDL or dense LDL. \nThere is evidence that an increased total LDL particle number is not good, but small LDLs are more atherogenic than the more buoyant, larger LDLs.  If LDL-TGs are high, there’s a high LDL particle count, a high ApoB, and small LDL particles. \nThe TGs probably came from VLDLs and chylomicrons which became remnant-like proteins. TGs invading HDL particles affect their functionality too. \nIn studies looking at LDL-TG, many inflammatory markers are high because those particles set off the inflammasome in endothelial cells and elsewhere. It’s a simple easy metric that tells us a lot. If it’s high, you’re likely dealing with an insulin resistant person rather than some less common genetic TG problem.\n\nWhy are we not bringing LDL-TG to a wider market?  If you look at VLDL cholesterol and markers of insulin resistance along with lipoprotein markers, you get the story \n \nTom’s preferred lab measurements [1:17:45]\nPeter’s take:\n\nPeter thinks it’s worth doing apoB over non-HDL cholesterol\nYet others say if you have non-HDL you do not need to measure apoB because non-HDL = LDL cholesterol + VLDL cholesterol. \n\nWhat does Tom think?  \n\nTom is in the Allan Sniderman school of thought: \n\nNon-HDL gives you slightly more info than LDL cholesterol. \nBut as several Sniderman studies show, even though non-HDL chol correlates a bit better with apoB than does LDL cholesterol, they are discordant in 20-30% of the population (eg, IR, diabetics). \nWhen they’re discordant, even with non-HDL and ApoB, risk follows ApoB.  \nIt’s foolish to say that if you’ve normalized non-HDL, then you have eliminated your LP-mediated risk\n\n\n\n“At the end of the day, I see no need to follow your non-HDL cholesterol.” —Tom Dayspring\nHow does Peter determine VLDL cholesterol in his patients? \n\nNot by dividing TGs by 5 as in the Friedewald formula. \nInstead, he would use a lab that measures VLDL cholesterol, \n\nAnd if this were not available he would subtract LDL-C and HDL-C from TC.  \n\n\nBut TG/5 is not a very accurate way of calculating VLDL-C. \nYou cannot do the calculation VLDL = TC – (LDL + HDL) if you have only calculated LDL – the VLDL-C formula only works with directly measured LDL \n\n \nThe latest in lipid-lowering therapies [1:21:30]\nOverview and latest with statins\n\nThere have been no new statins in the last 10+  years; the most recent (pitavastatin, brand name Livalo) was introduced in 2009. Third party payers are not going to pay for a new branded statin; there are 7 on the market so there won’t be a new one.  New ones are unlikely to avoid statin downsides.\nUsed to put people on statin for trivial increase in LDL or just to reduce MI risk. Now,  once you cross a certain threshold of risk, it makes sense to consider statin, but more than just LDL level is a factor.  Consider CAC, Lp(a), family hx, BP etc. – current guidelines say use these to help make decisions. No one says statins should be in the drinking water anymore!\n\nProcess for choosing a statin\n\nPeter’s practice only uses 4 of 7: Livalo (pitavastatin), Crestor (rosuvastatin), Lipitor (atorvastatin), and Pravachol (pravastatin).\nPeter still pushes for brand name when he can get it – his default position is that generics are crap until proven otherwise.\nUse Livalo and Pravachol for stain-sensitive patients, others are workhorses.  Pravastatin is safer than simvastatin or lovastatin for reasons mostly related to drug-drug interactions.  Livalo is even better at minimizing drug-drug interactions. People are often taking many supplements, not just other prescription drugs, so you can’t always check for interactions and will have less trouble if you use a low drug interaction option. \nRosuvastatin is way more potent than pravastatin (both are hydrophilic and somewhat hepatoselective), so Tom uses it most of the time (unless third party payor issues). Hydrophilic statins are less likely to get into the brain \n\nTherapeutic options\n\nCurrent guidelines say to pick one of the two most potent stains (Lipitor or Crestor) and prescribe at the maximum dose with the assumption that the lower level the better.\nHowever, Tom thinks statins’ real contribution to risk reduction is apoB reduction\nThe idea is to start with a smaller dose of statin (depending on risk) and optimize with a second apoB-lowering drug such as:\n\nEzetimibe—shown to be effective by trials as well as Mendelian randomization studies with the Niemann Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), and/or…\nBempedoic acid—the “new guy on the street”—a weaker cholesterol synthesis inhibitor affecting an earlier cholesterol synthesis step (which has also been suggested to be effective with Mendelian randomization)\n\n\n\nIn summary: A triple therapy—statin, ezetimibe, and benpedoic acid—can be used to avoid the expense of PCSK9 inhibitor \n \nThe different pathways among various lipid-lowering drugs [1:30:45]\nThe cholesterol synthesis pathway has 37 different steps, each with its own enzyme. \n\nStatins— \n\nInhibit the rate-limiting enzyme at the 3rd step (HMG CoA Reductase) in a dose-dependent fashion\nYou really want to focus on liver cells, which have the greatest propensity to target the LDL receptors that clear apoB\n\n\nEzetimibe—\n\nIf you can deplete cholesterol pools beyond what statins can do in the liver, you will express more LDL receptors.  \nEzetimibe blocks intestinal absorption of cholesterol or the backflow of bile cholesterol into the liver, increasing expression of LDL receptors and further depleting hepatic cholesterol pools \n\n\nBempedoic acid (BA)—\n\nBA is a newer option — it is an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor  \nThe first step in cholesterol synthesis is converting citrate to acetyl CoA, which becomes HMG and so on. \nBA is a pro drug—It is taken up only by the liver and inhibits a liver enzyme so that you cannot make acetyl CoA.\nThe less you make, the less HMG you make, providing even less substrate for statins, and the result is lower ApoB\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13801\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-19a-tom-1024x578.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"578\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-19a-tom-1024x578.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-19a-tom-300x169.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-19a-tom-768x433.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-19a-tom-1536x867.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-19a-tom.png 1790w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 19a.

Corresponding steps in figure 18a.\nThe biggest downside of statins is myopathic symptoms (weak muscles, muscle aches)\n\nBA is hepato-selective and has no uptake in muscle cells.\nRosuvastatin is somewhat hepato-selective but can still get into muscle and give you aches. \nEven PSK9 inhibitors had some evidence of muscle soreness (even though the mechanism is unclear like it is with statins), although the same is true with placebo. \n\nThe FDA approved BA (brand name Nexletol) but said a big outcome trial was needed, which the manufacturer is doing. Mendelian analysis has suggested it would work. The FDA let it on the market after a Phase 3 safety trial. (For ezetimibe, Mendelian studies suggested that reducing intestinal absorption of cholesterol would decrease CV events, and that turned out to be correct in outcome trials.)  You can add BA to a statin in people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), very high-risk people, or statin-intolerant patients, and/or you can give it with ezetimibe. \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13803\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-20-tom-1024x806.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"806\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-20-tom-1024x806.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-20-tom-300x236.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-20-tom-768x605.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-20-tom.png 1486w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 20. Pathway of bempedoic acid.\nSo we have several apoB-lowering options today that follow a standard path: statins, ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, rarely used bile acid sequestrants, and PCSK9 inhibitors.\n“It’s a fun time to be in the apoB world. We have a lot of therapies.” —Tom Dayspring\nAnd we’re not even talking about TGs, for which there are also therapies that might contribute to apoB lowering. \nStatins work by regulation of hepatic LDL receptors. How does BA work? Is it about inhibiting synthesis? \n\nIf it inhibits synthesis, it will also upregulate LDL receptor expression (and maybe other receptors too), so in the end it’s depleting the hepatic cholesterol pool. \nBA is attractive because it is more hepatoselective (even if less potent)\nTrials suggest that BA monotherapy produces 10-18% lowering of LDL (similar to ezetimibe) and a 10-12% decrease in apoB. \nEzetimibe + statins result in a wide range of decreases because people’s reactions vary.\n\n \nThe latest on EPA and DHA [1:38:15]\n\nMendelian studies suggest that certain genes are involved with TG and atherosclerosis, so it’s plausible that you could reduce disease if you improve TGs.  For a long time, we used lifestyle, niacin, and fibric acid (until they did badly designed trials that concluded fibrates didn’t work because they didn’t give them to any subjects with high TGs). But there has always been an idea that omega-3s could lower TGs.  \nAs Bill Harris says, to get lower TGs with omega-3s, you need to use serious doses (not 1 or 2 g). Omega 3s likely have other as yet unknown attributes, as they are a crucial part of cell membranes and signaling. Use maximum dose – about 4000 mg/d – if you want to use omegas to help lower TGs.\n\nTrials were done giving 4 g/d to people who had high TGs (many of whom also had low HDL). The first trials were done in Japan about 10 years ago, giving subjects EPA only (we’re not sure why) on top of a stain.  The patients did not necessarily have high TGs, but many did.  The studies were not blinded but produced evidence that EPA at a high dose (4 g) reduces macrovascular outcomes when given with a statin. \nAmarin, the company that makes branded EPA (Vascepa), did a major clinical trial called REDUCE IT which enrolled people taking stains to get LDL below 70 (generally high risk people). You had to have TG = 135+ to get into trial; most were around 150.  They were maximized on whatever stain they used to get LDL-C under 100.  High dose EPA (2 g BID with food) led to almost 30% residual risk reduction. \n\n\nTom and Bill Harris believed you could also just give 4 g of EPA/DHA. DHA is important too (brain and cell membranes need it), and although most people can convert EPA to DHA, not all can. \nAstraZeneca acquired a free omega-3 fatty acid (not an ethyl ester, so has better absorption, pharmacokinetics and bioavailability) called Epanova, which is free EPA and free DHA. It enrolled high TG patients in the STRENGTH trial but stopped the study after 2 years (in November 2019) and the data has never been published. [1:44:50] Stopping the study took a lot of people off guard. AstraZeneca announced that it stopped the trial because there was no signal.  There has been surprise and annoyance that the data has not been published, and the reason remains unclear, arousing suspicion. \n\nPeter asks: Was the difference the EPA/DHA combo or the vehicle of delivery? \nWe aren’t sure and you should have Bill Harris back on to discuss that. We want to achieve a certain level of omega 3s in the blood or cell membrane (they did not measure omega 3 index in the REDUCE IT trial, but rather serum omega 3 FA levels, and this data has been presented but not published). The efficacy of an EPA-only product highly depends on the serum EPA level you achieved in the serum, which supports 4 g/day rather than 2 g/day. \n***\n* Take home points for EPA/DHA:neFA *\nShould we use EPA or an EPA/DHA combo? You have to go with EPA 4g/d for those in a high-risk category if you want to be evidence based.\nWhat if TG < 150 (say TG = 100) but still residual apoB risk?  Not answerable right now.  Tom is not afraid to keep using combo and is a fan of measuring the Omega-3 index.  If you take 4 g EPA but your index shows adequate DHA, he would know that some of that EPA is being converted and be happy.\nWhat if you take 4 g EPA but your index shows inadequate DHA? Then start giving a little DHA too.  Tom doubts that a little DHA is negating EPA, but who knows – maybe it’s true?  We need published data. Peter says the Epanova study did not have enough in common with REDUCE IT to answer that question, but maybe it gives us a clue.  We are doing more EPA trials and sub-analyses now so we will get more information, and we have some angiographic data [published after this podcast was recorded]. Plaque looks a lot better if you are taking 4 g of EPA, which is encouraging.\n \nFibrates—an underappreciated treatment for hypercholesterolemia [1:49:45]\nTom thinks fibrates are a widely underused drug. \nIf identify TG-rich lipoproteins or IR or diabetics, fibrate subtrial analysis shows “miraculous things” for both macro and microvascular endpoints (retina, peripheral nervous system, renal function). They may screw up creatinine levels a bit, but you are improving eGFR (because overproduction of creatinine is not reflective of eGFR). \n\nFenofibric acid, sold as Trilipix, is the purest as it is the only one that isn’t a prodrug. If you have to use one, use Trilipix. \nA new fibrate is pemafibrate (Parmodia), a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha receptor modulator (SPPARM). There are big outcome trials going on right now, so it won’t be used for a while yet. \n\nNiacin, on the other hand, is a “dead drug” that is no longer included in guidelines.  Some Lp(a) advocates (like Sam Tsimikas) will still use niacin in certain cases, but few still agree with that approach \nBack to fibrates:\n\nPeter has 3-4 patients on Trilipix and it’s a “world beater.” One patient looked like he had FH & also familial high TG. Peter knew he’d end up on both a statin and a fibrate at some point but wanted to see what would happen with just Trilipix.  TG had been about 400 and apoB > 200, went to TG 100 and ApoB 80-100.  It’s not irrational to try this unless super high risk. \nWith Peter Jones, Tom has published data using NMR on rosuvastatin and fenofibric acid. Some subjects had very good reductions in LDL-P with fenofibrate, but got much more reduction in remnants with fibrate than with a statin (If TG = 400, you would expect that there is some contribution from remnants)\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13804\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-21-tom-1024x667.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-21-tom-1024x667.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-21-tom-300x196.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-21-tom-768x501.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-21-tom-1536x1001.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-21-tom.png 1562w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 21.
