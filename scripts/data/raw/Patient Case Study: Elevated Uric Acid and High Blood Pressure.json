No signs of metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance. \n\nExercise:\n\nWeight training 3x/week\nZone2 training 3 hr a week.\n\nImaging:\n\nCAC of 88 – Approximately 85th percentile for age. (even more reason to be aggressive in treating blood pressure)\n\n*To reiterate: This is a guy that on paper looked really good. He’s also very muscular and lean. He runs and exercises six days/week. He also eats well.\nLooking at his initial labs—\n<img decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13596\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-H-1-1024x241.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-H-1-1024x241.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-H-1-300x71.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-H-1-768x181.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-H-1-1536x361.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-H-1-2048x482.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 21. Patient H – Initial Labs when presenting with essential hypertension.\nObservations:\n\nHis uric acid was 6.1\nIt was also quite stubborn—never went down with a dietary change (tweaking protein levels, reducing fructose, etc.)\nPeter could not get his uric acid below 6, and the target was below 5\nSee Rick Johnson podcast to understand the importance of lowering uric acid\n\nLabs after ~18 months on Uloric—\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13597\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-H-2-1024x678.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-H-2-1024x678.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-H-2-300x199.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-H-2-768x509.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patient-H-2.png 1090w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 22. Labs after ~18 months on Uloric.\nObservations: \n\nUloric “fixed” uric acid\nHis HTN resolved even with a persistently high homocysteine\nHe no longer required ACE inhibitor (for blood pressure)\n\nConcluding thoughts:\n\nThis is a pretty unusual response to just lowering uric acid\nBut it’s also a great teaching point—\n\nDo NOT go after blood pressure until you’ve got the uric acid below 5\nOnly then start playing with the blood pressure medication \n\n\n*The broader point: Try to fix the insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome first (which in this case he didn’t have, but he did have the elevated uric acid) before you introduce drugs to treat blood pressure.\n\nWhat determines uric acid levels?\n\nThings that can drive up uric acid levels include:\n\nPeople who eat foods with lots of DNA and RNA (i.e., protein sources)\nYeast in the beer\nFructose\nBut the biggest part may be genetics, says Peter ⇒ “I don’t know why it is that in some patients you can remove all of the normal impediments to normal uric acid metabolism and it’s still elevated.”\n\n\nFor Peter personally—\n\nDespite eating and exercising well, he can’t get his uric acid below 5.5 without using allopurinol\nHe has a family history of hypertension\n\n\n\n⇒ Make sure to check out Rick Johnson’s episode for more on the importance of managing uric acid levels\nPeter’s internal standard for blood pressure: Below 120/80 without producing any symptoms of lightheadedness\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialSee episode of The Drive with Rick Johnson for the importance of managing uric acid: #87 – Rick Johnson, M.D.: Fructose—The common link in high blood pressure, insulin resistance, T2D, & obesity? | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [40:00, 1:12:30]]\n§"
