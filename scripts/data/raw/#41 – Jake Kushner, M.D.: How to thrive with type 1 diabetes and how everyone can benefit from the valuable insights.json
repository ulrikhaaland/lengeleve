  "content": "In this episode, Jake Kushner, pediatric endocrinologist specializing in helping people with type 1 diabetes and Medical Director of McNair Interests, discusses the best strategies to live and thrive with T1D, especially as it relates to diet and exercise. We also discuss why many patients who control their blood sugar with high amounts of exogenous insulin are at a substantially higher risk than people who can control their blood sugar at lower levels of insulin. This concept has great implications for non-diabetics as well considering the increasing prevalence of diseases related to insulin resistance. We also cover some of the basics, the history, the increasing prevalence of type 1 diabetes, and more importantly, what we can do to help kids with this disease, and their families.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#41 - Jake Kushner, M.D.: How to thrive with type 1 diabetes and how everyone can benefit from the valuable insights\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#41 - Jake Kushner, M.D.: How to thrive with type 1 diabetes and how everyone can benefit from the valuable insights\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#41 - Jake Kushner, M.D.: How to thrive with type 1 diabetes and how everyone can benefit from the valuable insights\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nHow Jake became interested in type 1 diabetes [5:30];\nThe pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes, the increase in prevalence, and the role of beta cells [17:00];\nThe role of body weight and BMI in the risk of developing T1D [27:00];\nGenetics of T1D and the risk of inheritance [32:00];\nHemoglobin A1c [36:15];\nInsulin: the amazing story of its discovery, its effect on cellular metabolism and IGF-1, and why the hell it’s so expensive [39:15];\nDiabetes Control and Complication Trial: blood glucose and the complications associated with diabetes [54:45];\nCognitive impairment, epigenetic changes, and other dangers associated with high, peak blood glucose, and big swings in blood glucose levels [1:09:15];\nDepression, anxiety, and other challenges of living with T1D [1:15:30];\nJake’s realization that the current standard of care of T1D is inadequate [1:26:15];\nManaging diabetes with exercise [1:30:15];\nThe Bernstein method, and protein’s impact on glucose and insulin [1:36:15];\nJake radically changes his approach to treating patients [1:45:00];\nWhat other tools are there for controlling T1D?

And frankly if you subscribe to the idea that lower levels of glucose and insulin are just better overall, there may even be other applications.”\n\nJake’s path to becoming a pediatric endocrinologist\n\nTrying to decide in between being a pediatrician and being a molecular biologist\n“I thought I would do that and the classical path as an endocrinologist is to go and find a rare disorder and discover the molecular basis for it and find some unique product that you could then replace and provide it”\nWas also interested in pediatrics\nundergraduate at Berkeley working continuously in basic science research labs\nSeveral years afterwards as a research technician, first at UCSF and then Oregon. \nMedical school at Albany Medical College in New York\nPediatric resident at Brown University \nEnamored by endocrinology in general, so he applied and got fellowship at Children’s Hospital Boston \nAlso served as a research fellow at the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School\n\nHow Jake became so interested in type 1 diabetes\n“As a first year endocrine fellow, we’re running around an incredibly busy service, and we’re interacting with families of children who are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. And I just thought, ‘Wow, this is really an amazing and challenging problem.’ And it has so many aspects of medicine that I appreciate. It has, most importantly human elements, but there’s also basic science.”\n\nJake saw the toll it took on people and especially parents\nHe also saw how often is was either completely missed or a misdiagnosis was given\n\nAbout 30% of the kids that are diagnosed present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) which implies that they’ve had the illness for quite some time\n“When they present with diabetic ketoacidosis, it means that they have somehow managed to slip through the cracks. Nobody’s figured out that their glucose level is through the roof, or that they’re becoming acidotic or do these other things. And what actually brings them into the hospital is a septic-like situation.”\n\n\n\nOnset of T1D in adults\n\nThe presentation of DKA is less frequent in older people, who generally become diabetic at a slower pace which is known as cryptic type 1 diabetes\nIn these people… they probably have autoimmune antibodies, and they have some degree of loss of beta cells ⇒ “and this phenomenon explains some of the adult onset diabetes that you just don’t quite understand”\n\nHow many people in the United States have type 1 versus type 2?\n\nSo Type 1 is approximately one in 300 people\nThe typical age of onset is around nine years old\nAnd they live into adulthood, and many can survive into their 80s\n“It’s the most common life threatening, medication requiring, illness of childhood.”\n\n“And when you’re working in a fancy medical school, it’s quite sort of tempting to focus on a rare, unique condition that most people don’t get a lot of exposure to, and bypass the really common things. But for me, type 1 diabetes was the elephant in the room. It was just so compelling and I ended up being the first clinical fellow at Boston Children’s in 10 years to go into type 1 diabetes.”\nThe pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes, the increase in prevalence, and the role of beta cells [17:00]\n“At a very high level, there are genetic, as well as environmental contributors”\nThe molecular pathophysiology\n\nAutoimmune condition\nLargely driven by T cells, but there is also a contribution of B cells\nAnd because of that, you can detect antibodies in the serum that indicate autoimmunity\nBy some combination of bad luck, genetics and possibly the foods you eat (to a very modest degree) this stochastic phenomenon begins to move forward:\n\nwhereby the beta cell, which secretes insulin, begins to dump off antigens\nAnd the antigens begin to provoke the immune system locally\nAnd some of those immune cells start to destroy beta cells and dump out more antigens\n\n\n\nThe role of the pancreas\n\nExocrine=About 95% of the pancreas by mass serves an exocrine function, which is it’s mostly there for local digestion\nEndocrine=However, about 5% of the pancreas by mass, including these cells called beta cells, acts as an endocrine organ (versus an exocrine organ), which means it’s secreting systemic hormones into the system (insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide)\n\n“When they begin to dump off their antigens and provoke autoimmunity, you can get this sort of death spiral. Where ultimately, the end result is a progressive autoimmunity, where you lose beta cells over time. And I don’t think that there’s any one single, for instance, virus that can be conclusively ascribed to autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes.” \nBMI and T1D\n\nIn populations, the heavier you are, the more likely you are to have T1D (note: this doesn’t seem to hold up in individuals)\n“…which implies either that the work of the beta cells contributing to the autoimmunity, or alternatively the work of the beta cell and the relative beta cell insufficiency reveals this autoimmunity that otherwise would have been cryptic.”\n\nWhat has been the relative change in the incidence of type 1 diabetes?\n\nDoubled since 1960\nPossible explanations?\n\nEnvironmental factors (i.e. obesity)\nViruses we’re now exposed to\nWe’re simply better at diagnosing\n\n\n\nDiagnosing kids with T1D\n\nGreater awareness than in the past\nCan be caught as early as 6 months, however, they don’t have classical signs and symptoms\nif nobody bothers to check the serum glucose, you might never know that they in fact have life threatening diabetic ketoacidosis and new onset type 1 diabetes. It’s a disaster.\n\nKids vs adults\n\nKids have a more aggressive onset\nThe condition becomes life threatening quicker and their autoimmunity is more aggressive because they don’t have the reserve of beta cells\nAdults have a greater reserve of beta cells so their onset takes longer and is slowly progressing\nThis makes it difficult for a precise diagnosis\n\nMisdiagnosing adults\n\nPeople are getting diagnosed at type 2, when instead they have cryptic type 1\nThis leads to incorrect treatment\n\nThe role of B cells\n\nThe idea of an antigenic spread…\n“The beta cells make very unique things, and when you break them open and destroy them, you begin to dump them out. There is both the B and a T cell response.\nWe can test for antibodies in the serum of people with type 1 diabetes, and they make unique antibodies against insulin and GAD, glutamic acid decarboxylase, as well as a protein, tyrosine phosphatase called ICA 512\nAnd so those antibodies are commonly used in the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, which we believe to be a T cell disease\nBut that doesn’t make complete sense because antibodies are made by B cells, so there must be some contribution\n\n⇒ Proof of the role of B cells in T1D: Rituximab, B-Lymphocyte Depletion, and Preservation of Beta-Cell Function\n\nA huge clinical trial using Rituximab, which alters B cell function, alters the ability of the B cells to make antibodies\nThey were able to delay the course of type 1 diabetes\n\nOther autoimmune diseases that share this phenomenon where you have this B cell, T cell component:\n\nAutoimmune thyroid disease, where you can get thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies ⇒ Largely that’s a T cell mediated disease\n\nAnd by the way, autoimmune thyroid disease is associated with type 1 diabetes or vice-versa.\nMeaning patients who go on earlier in life to develop type 1 diabetes would be much more likely than patients without it to go onto get Graves’ disease or some of the other autoimmune thyroid disorders\nTypically Type 1 would present, and then they can get autoimmune thyroid disease. \n\n\nAdrenal disease\nSialadenitis (rarely) which is autoimmune disease of the salivary gland\nOophoritis of the ovaries (also rare)\nPernicious anemia, the ability to produce B12 ⇒ And so that’s presumably an autoimmune disease of the cells that make B12\nCeliac disease\n\nThe role of body weight and BMI in the risk of developing T1D [27:00]\nDo we believe that there are any exposures that are withheld from kids that may be predisposing them to Beta cell destruction?\n\nThere’s no one precise thing\nBut there is some evidence that a higher BMI could predispose kids to T1D\n“…this implies that the Standard American Diet (SAD) may be predisposing the population in aggregate ever so slightly towards more type 1 diabetes, which is a scary thought.”\nPaper that has some evidence for the SAD being linked to T1D in kids: Excess BMI in Childhood: A Modifiable Risk Factor for Type 1 Diabetes Development?\n\nGenetics of T1D and the risk of inheritance [32:00]\nHLA alleles\n\nThere are certain HLA alleles that are quite common in the human population\nExample, HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4, and others\nAnd when certain HLA are combined it increases the odds of having a child with T1D\nThe people who have T1D often have these alleles, and also these other minor alleles that by themselves contribute a small amount of risk, but in aggregate it increases quite a bit\n\nRisk of a child getting T1D if one of their parents has it\n\nStatistically, it adds up to a 10x increase that your child will have T1D if you have it\nHowever, since T1D is 1 in 300 for the general population, a 10x increase only brings it to 1 in 30\nOr said another way, there’s still a 97% chance your child will NOT inherit T1D\n\nT1D in twins\n\nIdentical twins\n\nConcordance within the first few years is only around 50 or 60%\nBut by adulthood it’s about 80%\n\n\nFraternal twins ⇒ 10x increase relative to general population \n\nHemoglobin A1c [36:15]\nWhat is hemoglobin A1c?\n\nIt’s a way to understand the average blood glucose a person has\nIt measures the amount of glycosylation, or how much glucose is sticking to hemoglobin\nIf we take the assumption that hemoglobin has a relatively finite, fixed, predictable life before the red blood cells themselves get broken down, we can measure the hemoglobin A1c and then impute the average blood glucose\n\nDiagnosing type 2 diabetes (T2D)\n\nToday, a diagnosis of T2D is made solely on the hemoglobin A1c being greater than 6.5%\nIt no longer relies on the insulin or glucose level during an oral glucose challenge\n\nTranslating A1C to average blood glucose\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6720 size-full\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A1c_med_ref_table.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"670\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A1c_med_ref_table.png 650w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/A1c_med_ref_table-291x300.png 291w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" />\nFigure 1.

The in-and-out doors of a fat cell. Image credit: How to make a fat cell less not thin: the lessons of fat flux\nIn a muscle cell:\n⇒ In a fed state…\n\nIt’s promoting glucose uptake into skeletal muscle\nThe insulin signal tell the glucose transporter to move to the cell wall\nGLUT4, a glucose transporter, translocate from the cytosol to the cell wall which make the muscle cell permeable for glucose to be shuttled in\n\n⇒ In a state of starvation…\n\nAt a cellular level, people with T1D are starving\nMuscle is broken down and used for gluconeogenesis\nIt creates a profound negative nitrogen balance\n\n“Many of the major steps of protein metabolism are influenced by insulin. . .in the presence of insulin you’re putting more glycogen into skeletal muscle, or in the absence you’re gonna break it down.”\n“And because it’s so fundamental to eukaryotic cells it seems to also influence things that you would never even imagine, like for instance lifespan and aging.”\nInsulin and IGF\n\nInsulin goes up, free IGF-1 goes up ⇒ “The more hyperinsulinemic a patient is, all things equal, the higher you tend to see their IGF”\nThis is because insulin drives down the IGF binding proteins (i.e. IGFBP1)\ninsulin and IGF-1 one really are intensely overlapping in the way they work\nInsulin is a heterodimer\n\n“When you block these heterodimeric receptors, you can completely alter metabolism, implying that the role of IGF-1 on glucose homeostasis is really quite powerful.”\nFor more on IGF, see the following episodes of The Drive with Rhonda Patrick and this episode with Nir Barzilai\nBack to the story of Banting and Best discovering insulin…\n\nBanting is a struggling surgeon in London\nHe’s a reader, and he’s thinking about ways to try to contribute\nHe reads this journal article which describes how people who have stones in the pancreas end up with these strange islet like structures, or islets of cells\nEssentially what happens is the pancreas, for whatever reason, if it’s obstructed by a stone and it has a blockage, what you end up with, in the residual after the pancreatitis occurs, are these weird round cellular structures…\nSo it had been known from a couple other scientists that there might be something in there that was involved in diabetes…\nSo Banting comes up with the following idea: “Wow, maybe what I could do is block the outflow of the exocrine pancreas, which makes these digestive enzymes, force the pancreas it eat itself alive, and then I will take this residual muck that comes from the pancreas and try to purify whatever is within it to see if that is some sort of medicine that might be useful for type one diabetes.”\nIt’s a genius moment that comes to him in the middle of the night\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6722 size-large\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/notebook-981x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"981\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/notebook-981x1024.png 981w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/notebook-288x300.png 288w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/notebook-768x801.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/notebook.png 1426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px\" />\nFigure 3.

Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these to relieve glycosurea”. Image credit: Banting and Best: The Extraordinary Discovery of Insulin\n\nBanting then goes to the University of Toronto and convinces a reluctant professor (Dr. John Macleod) of metabolism to let him try this experiment\nBanting recruits a medical student to help, Charles Best\nAmazingly they are able to isolate this substance that has the ability to lower blood glucose in dogs\n\nThe process of making insulin to treating a human:\n\nCarry out the intervention\nThe pancreas eats itself alive\nThey get this muck, and they’re able to isolate some crude extract\nThey then take it and put it back into a dog that they’ve removed the entire pancreas of, and it lowers the blood glucose in the dog\nShortly thereafter, they give insulin to a medical student with T1D and are able to lower his blood glucose\nThen they write the paper, and the paper gets rejected, then they’re able to submit it to a Canadian journal and it gets accepted\nBanting and Macleod were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6723 size-full\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/banting-best-photo-2843-landscape-gallery.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"537\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/banting-best-photo-2843-landscape-gallery.jpg 537w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/banting-best-photo-2843-landscape-gallery-224x300.jpg 224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px\" />\nFigure 4. Charles Best and Frederick Banting with a diabetic dog. Image credit: nobelprize.org\nHow long until recombinant insulin was created?\n\nInsulin for human treatment originally came from pigs\nA company called Genentech produced the first recombinant insulin\nAn “amazing article” about the molecular biology of modern insulin and the race to create it: Cloning Insulin\n\nWhy the hell is recombinant insulin so expensive?!\n\nIt used to be so cheap, about $25 for 1,000 units (a month’s supply)\nNow 1,000 units costs $300-$400\n\nPeter: How is it that we have more competitors in the space, better technology today, and we’ve watched a log fold increase in the price of this stuff? \nJake:\n“It’s a disaster on many levels. It’s really a disaster for people who are on the margins of society but want modern care and are willing to pay for it, but they can’t get insulin at the same price that, for instance, you could if you walked into a pharmacy in Spain. You could buy a vial of insulin for 25 bucks there. It’s three or 400 dollars here. The difference, unfortunately, is that the federal government is a … How shall I say it? A promiscuous customer. So they, thus far, have not been able to drive the price down because they’re willing to essentially pay whatever the sellers charge. That’s a big problem, and it speaks to the lack of market influence in things like insulin.”\nDiabetes Control and Complication Trial: blood glucose and the complications associated with diabetes [54:45]\nWhy does diabetes lead to amputations, blindness and other microvascular complications?\n\nBlindness is from abnormal vessel growth ⇒ there’s a series of damages that happen in the vascular endothelium, and then there’s new vessels that are created, and the new vessels are fragile and they can ultimately break and bleed\nIn the kidneys ⇒ Basically very high glucose can alter the epithelia of the kidney that’s involved in filtering blood and making urine\nAmputations are due to altered healing ⇒ There are 2 parts to this:\n\nFirst, there’s something called diabetic neuropathy where the nerves simply don’t work well and when exposed to high glucose they lose their responsiveness\nThe second part is abnormal healing because the the microvasculature isn’t behaving appropriately\nTogether, these issues can be very bad diabetic wounds that fail to get better with antibiotic and ultimately result in amputation\n\n\n\n“This is the most common cause of preventable amputation in the United States. It’s also the most common cause of preventable blindness in the United States, and probably also renal failure.”\nDiabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT)\n\nThe DCCT set out to test whether tight control of blood glucose (i.e. near normal ranges) confers protection against diabetes complications\nThey found the answer to be yes, and they published their results in 1993\nIn other words, as the average blood glucose increases, the microvascular complications increase as well\nPrior to the 1993 paper from the DCCT, it wasn’t obvious that the differences in these complications could be explained by the differences in their average blood glucose\n\nThe challenge of controlling blood sugar in people with T1D\n\nHowever, you can’t just throw a bunch of insulin at the problem because it could cause hypoglycemia, dangerously low blood glucoses\nThe crux of the problem is the volatility in blood glucose\nSo it’s not just so simple that you can figure out the amount of carbohydrates you’re gonna eat and take some insulin and your blood sugar is gonna be normal\nStress, sleep quality, exercise all have an impact\nAnd the other things in food, like fat and protein, also alter gastric emptying and the end result is a tremendous amount of variance in the system\nSo there is no exact formula of insulin to carb ratio\n\n“Your level of stress, how much sleep you had last night, how much exercise you’ve done or not done can even in the presence of the identical foodstuff produce completely different insulin requirements.”\nDetails of, and the controversy around, the DCCT\n\nSome well-meaning physicians thought is was foolish and dangerous to test this theory \nThey were worried about hypoglycemia\nIt’s a very difficult trial to do, because there were no established best practices to achieve near or normal blood glucoses at the time\n1,441 patients with T1D\nTheir average hemoglobin A1c for the population is around 9% at the time\nTheir life expectancy is truncated dramatically and their quality of life is going to be, even by their 40s, they’re going to be quite compromised\nwe know now from Swedish studies that somebody with with an average A1C of 9% has a six-fold increase risk of cardiovascular disease\nSo the DCCT decided they wanted to get people under 6% A1C\nWith a ton of effort, they managed to put together a plan that allowed them to achieve this\nDiabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy were the outcomes they were measuring\nTrial was supposed to run for 10 years\nBut the trial was stopped 7 years because the treatment group was seeing so much benefit from the intervention that it was no longer ethical to deprive the general population of this treatment\n\n“In some ways, it really makes the field of modern type 1 diabetes care, because it says there really is something you can do other than hold somebody’s hand and look for complications. But on the other hand, it actually breaks the field because we don’t have the apparatus to routinely achieve the kinds of outcomes that the NIH was able to do, because they had near infinite resources. They spent over $100 million for a relatively small number of patients.”\nSide effects of tight control of blood glucose:\n\nHypoglycemic events\nWeight gain\n\nWhy did people gain weight?\n\nThis is one of the continual problems with type 1 diabetes, is if you jack up the insulin and your blood glucose is low, there’s only one thing you can do to get your glucose back up, eating refined carbohydrates\nYou are essentially “chasing carbs”\nIn the years since the DCCT, what we’ve seen is a huge number of people with type 1 diabetes have gained weight, in some cases, uncontrollably. And that is a really serious problem and moreover, the people who have gained the most weight have had poor cardiovascular outcomes.\nReally important question: Is the weight gain in type 1 diabetes absolutely obligate? Is it coincident with tight control? And it was argued by many that the only way towards tight control would be weight gain. \n\n30 year follow up to the DCCT: Update on Cardiovascular Outcomes at 30 Years of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study\n\nFollowing the 7-year DCCT trial, the cohorts were merged followed for another 23 years\nDuring the 23 years, their A1C averaged about 8% (compared to 6% of the tightly controlled group) \n\nThe amazing finding:\n\nThe group that received tight control for 7 years, had less cardiovascular disease and death than the group that received “conventional” treatment\nIn other words, the 7 years of tight control still retained some benefit from the seven years, 30 years earlier\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6724 size-large\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DCCT-1024x469.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DCCT-1024x469.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DCCT-300x138.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DCCT-768x352.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 5.

How do you reduce that volatility?\n\nDangers of exposure to high blood glucose and/or variability\nCognitive impairment: Peter’s reading of the literature suggests that people, especially developing children, could have cognitive impairment associated with high blood glucose variability\nEpigenetic changes:\n\nJake says it could be the variability or it could the exposure to high peak levels of blood glucose could actually cause epigenetic changes\nNow there’s a whole rich field that’s devoted to this idea of these windows of hyperglycemia permanently altering these important cells that ultimately contribute to diabetes complications\n\n“Very short exposures to high blood sugars can completely change gene expression in a whole bunch of genes, like endothelial cells. So there’s a school of thought that says that diabetes complications are really around the exposures to these weird toxic levels of blood glucose that can occur.”\nDepression, anxiety and other challenges of living with T1D [1:15:30]\nChallenges of managing blood glucose\n\nThere is no perfect formula to manage it that is also practical and easy for a patient\nJake said many doctors still struggle with this:\n\n“We this fantasy that we’re just going to sort of make people live in what I call the Diabetes ICU, which is a prescribed number of carbohydrates and timing and then we’re going to work towards making sure that everything was very predictable and the blood glucoses would be near normal much of the time. . .And I lived in that fantasy world unperturbed by reality until I became close friends with several people who have type 1 diabetes and then I began to see what they do.”\nThe ultimate bio hack\n\nJake tells a story of a friend of his who lives with T1D\nShe meticulously combs through her food to make sure she doesn’t eat anything that perturbs her glucose levels too much\nBut it’s not just carbs she has to watch, she has to understand the balance of fats and proteins which can affect things as well\nBut ultimately, she is finding a way to live her life while keeping her blood glucose “near normal”\n\nParenting a child with T1D\n\nSending your small child to a birthday party where they eat 2 cupcakes and it can have devastating ramifications\nJake has seen kids die when they go to college from fatal hypoglycemic episodes when they suddenly have tempted college kid stuff (drinking and eating) and they can’t manage their blood glucose even when taking the same insulin dose they did before\n\nCognitive Load of living with diabetes\n\nJake defines the cognitive load as the burden of having to think nonstop about your diabetes\n“Nobody ever really just gets to be a parent or a kid, because there’s this constant fear of what’s my blood sugar? Is it high or low?”\nThis leads to anxiety and depression for many of those with T1D ⇒ About 40-50% of people with T1D\n\nQuantifying the cognitive load with the “diabetes distress scale”\n\nIt’s a 1 to 10 scale that the patient answers\n1=you know you have diabetes but it’s not holding you back at all. It’s there it’s in the back of your mind, it’s not bothering you. You get to do what you wanna do.\n10=you have diabetes and you can’t think about anything else and it’s pretty much omnipresent and it alters your ability to carry out the things you wanna do.\nAverage score of a teenager on a high-carb diet=7 or 8\n\nGuilt and shame\n\nJake says these people, especially teens, are rarely ever asked, “How do you feel?”\nJake has teens burst in tears the moment he asks the question and they say “Ten”\nUp until that point they’ve been told they are listening and are being “non-compliant”, when in fact they are constantly thinking about it and living with the burden\nJake says the medical establishment is reinforcing this:\n\nSo this endless cycle of blame and shame and negativity is unfortunately in many cases, reinforced by the medical establishment. ‘Cause now you come and you got a hemoglobin a1c of 14 and what do you get? . . . you get a lecture about how you need to do a better job. You’re told you’re not compliant. You might even be threatened with being fired by your doctor unless you do a better job.”\nChanging lives with treatment\n\nJake says when he can connect with a patient and manage to get their A1C from 14 down to 7, for example, it changes their life (and Jake’s life)\n“They are finally able to think and feel and see the world around them and the love all these people who were trying to help them have that they couldn’t even recognize.”\n\nJake’s realizes that the current standard of care of T1D is inadequate [1:26:15]\n\nJakes original career plan upon finishing his fellowship and getting his first job as a professor at UPenn was that he was going to use basic science to advance outcomes for people with T1D by figuring out ways to grow new beta cells safely and reliably\nMeanwhile, he also had a clinical practice focused on T1D and other endocrine disorders\nHe starts to become close friends with T1D and he is following them closely and watching the challenges and hacks they use\nIn 2007, Jake is introduced to the original model of the continuous glucose monitor (CGM) made by Dexcom\nJake is very excited thinking that this device will change everything\nHowever, it turns out that this first device was frustrating for patients because they didn’t really know what do with the information \nAnd the doctors involved in treating these patients didn’t have much advice other than to badger them to do a better job with managing their insulin doses and carbohydrate feedings\nDoctors would tell patients, “Oh, you need to check your blood glucose 20 minutes before the meal and give yourself insulin 20 minutes before the meal and do that in a very reliable way so that your blood glucose is normal.”\n\n“There’s a major problem in that we live in this fantasy world in medicine, where we think people just need to carry out their lives with more precision and that will be the answer but the reality is variance is contained in human behavior. It’s just what we do. So that idea of badgering people doesn’t work.”\nManaging diabetes with exercise [1:30:15]\nInsulin-dependent vs insulin-independent\n\nThe non-athlete gets most glucose into muscle via insulin-dependent pathway whereby insulin signals GLUT4 to move to the cell membrane (as described earlier at xx:xx)\nBut there is an insulin-independent pathway to get glucose uptake into muscle\n\nExercise\n\nPeople can use exercise can help people control their diabetes\nPart of the mechanism is via the insulin-independent glucose uptake into skeletal muscle via AMP kinase\n\nAMP kinase\n\nAn enzyme that is sensing the energy status of the cell\nIf you alter the energy status of the cell through a tremendous amount of work (exercise), it signals the GLUT4 to translocate to the membrane of the skeletal muscle\nSo now you get insulin-independent glucose uptake into skeletal muscle\n\nThe unanswered question Peter still wants to know:\n\nWhat explains the increase in insulin sensitivity through exercise?\n\nIs it that you are more sensitive to insulin itself (i.e. 1 unit of insulin invokes more GLUT4 translocation in someone who is exercising vs when they are not exercising) OR…\nIs it more about AMPK and its effect on GLUT4 translocation?\n\n\n\nPeter’s amazing patient with T1D\n\nOnly takes 5 units per day (many people takes 60-70 per day)\nHe walks 6-10 miles per day\nOnly carbs he eats come from veggies\nSuper low body fat, “I’ve never seen a higher adiponectin and lower leptin in a human I’ve ever measured. He is a lean, mean, machine.”\n\nAerobic vs strength training\n\nJake believe aerobic is better for this purpose\nWhat about HIIT training versus long durations?\n\n\nJake says he sees long distance aerobic being most effective at dramatically reducing their total amount of insulin\nHowever, it’s not known for sure… “there’s relative debate and this is not well-studied so you’d like to really carry out a proper study with high-intensity exercise versus very slow, long duration exercise.”\n\n\n\n“But this idea of trying to sort of hack the system to reduce the total exposure to insulin and therefore reduce the volatility and the hyperglycemic excursions, that’s really exciting, and I suspect that the people like your patient, who are done to [five] units of insulin, these people have really cracked the code.”\nThe Bernstein method, and protein’s impact on glucose and insulin [1:36:15]<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6725\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dr-berstein-book-670x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"726\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dr-berstein-book-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dr-berstein-book-196x300.jpg 196w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dr-berstein-book-768x1174.jpg 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dr-berstein-book.jpg 1675w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" />\nFigure 6. Cover of Dr. Bernstein’s Diabetes Solution. Image credit: amazon.com\nDr. Richard Bernstein\n\nHe has a clinical practice in Westchester, New York treating specializing in diabetes\nHe himself has type 1 diabetes\nHe has been his own self-experiment for years and year\n\nDr. Bernstein’s book transformed Jake’s thinking about treating diabetes: Dr. Bernstein’s Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars\nThe Law of Small Numbers: \n\nIf you consume more carbs, you need more insulin and therefore there’s a greater opportunity to make a mistake\nIf you consume fewer carbs, you will consume less insulin and you’ll have fewer mistakes\n“It’s a very simple idea. It’s laid out along with a ton of practical tips in his book. He’s incredible.”\n\nMore details about his book and method:\n\nThe book helps both those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes\nHe figured out that if you avoided carbohydrates and if you give medium and long acting insulin to cover protein and fat and basal metabolic requirements, that you could get blood glucoses very, very close to normal\nHe typically prescribes a low carb, high protein diet ⇒ It’s not low carb, high fat, it’s not ketogenic\n\nProtein’s impact on insulin and how the Bernstein method manages it\n\n“In my patients with type one diabetes who consume protein and don’t cover it with insulin, they can get these massive glucose excursions.”\nwe think in general there’s a ratio of around 10 grams of protein to end up being 6 grams of carbohydrate\nBut the problem is the kinetics are not immediate, you don’t get gluconeogenesis in a matter of seconds, it’s delayed over hours\nAnd the essence of the Bernstein method is to try cover protein with insulin\nAnd he uses regular insulin (i.e. human insulin), not fast-acting insulin (i.e. Novolog)\nAnd the idea is that regular insulin, which is human insulin, has a peak of onset within approximately an hour or two, and it lasts for six to eight hours\nSo the regular insulin very roughly corresponds with the kinetics of what protein will do to your glucose\n\n“Unfortunately the insulin pump companies and even the insulin companies have advocated an approach that says, ‘Look, people who live with type one diabetes have tough lives. We need to support them, and they should be allowed to eat what they want. And they should just cover for it.’ . . .And the problem is you end up with these crazy oscillations. And the oscillations are associated again with a tremendous burden of illness and this cognitive load and this fear and this anxiety.”\nJake radically changes his approach to treating patients [1:45:00]\n\nJake’s patients are seeing great results\nTheir average A1C is 5.7 (“normal as normal gets” says Peter)\nThey also have fewer hypoglycemic events than most T1D patients with a A1C of 7\n\nHow is he able to achieve this?\n\nCGM by Dexcom has been tremendously helpful\nHe encourages his patients to join the facebook group, TypeOneGrit\nAnd he has fully implemented the Bernstein method with his patients\nHe also now sees way less patients so that he can spend much more time with each person\n\nWhy see less patients?\n⇒ Jake says the question he wanted to answer is… if doctor’s have limitless resources that they could make available to a single patient, and the doctor would really try to listen and understand and support people, could these patients have transformative outcomes?\n“Medicine has essentially given up on these teenage kids who have hemoglobin A1cs of 10 or 12 or 14, who are basically on a super highway to death. These are the people who are going to have their first heart attacks when they’re 35. And they feel paralyzed. And they’re looking for somebody who can really understand how difficult it is and to provide a level of comfort and compassion.”\nWhat other tools are there for controlling T1D? [1:49:45]\nFirst and foremost, a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) by Dexcom is essential (current model is the G6)\nNext, it’s important to be informed:\n\nBernstein’s book: Dr. Bernstein’s Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars\nBook by Adam Brown: Bright Spots & Landmines: The Diabetes Guide I Wish Someone Had Handed Me\nFacebook group: TypeOneGrit\nVarious podcasts (here’s one as an example)\nYoutube videos: Low Carb Down Under created by Dr. Rod Taylor\n\nMust watch video of lecture by Dr. Troy Stapleton:\n<iframe title=\"Dr. Troy Stapleton - &#039;Low Carb Management of Type 1 Diabetes&#039;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6LXtQqu0Ow?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nIs the ketogenic diet appropriate for those with T1D? [1:52:45]\nPeople with T1D that are trying to get into nutritional ketosis have a few unique problems:\n1 Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)\n\nThe normal person has an insulin response that suppresses ketones once it reaches the 6 or 7 millimolar level, where someone with T1D does not have the insulin to do this\nSo they could reach dangerous levels of ketones resulting in DKA\nIn other words, prolonged fasting in a person who lives with type one diabetes\n\n2 Euglycemic DKA\n\nThis is a new phenomena \nThis is seen in T1D patients that are using sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors)\nMostly seeing this is people with T1D, not so much T2D\nWARNING: These are not safe (yet) for type 1 diabetics, however, Jake is involved in clinical trials looking to add safety and monitoring mechanisms\nHow is euglycemic DKA happens:\nWhile taking the SGLT2, your CGM could be artificially showing a “normal” or low level of blood glucose\nSo if you were to forget to take a shot of insulin, or your pump doesn’t recognize you need insulin, you could be in danger\nBecause elevated blood glucose is the primary biomarker of life threatening insulin deficiency for people who live with type one\n\n3 Nutritional ketosis and hypoglycemic awareness\n\nPeople who are in hardcore ketosis who have circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate may become completely immune to low blood glucoses\nIn other words, there can be cases where someone has dangerously low blood glucose (say 25) and yet they feel fine due to the presence of ketones\nThe problem, however, is that they may go from feeling fine to fatally low blood glucose without warning\n\nThe most important lessons that can be applied by the non-diabetic population [1:59:00]\nHyperinsulinemia leads to cardiovascular disease\n“I think you have this unique population [type 1 diabetics] where you see the insulin that goes into them and you see it’s direct impact on weight gain. So we know that people consume very high carbohydrate diets and gain a bunch of weight in type one diabetes. They’re at risk for cardiovascular illness. And to me that just says that there’s something about the Standard American Diet that’s making us sick. And ultimately we will be at risk for cardiovascular disease.”\nLessons from observing treatment options for type 2 diabetics\n2 types of treatments\n\nMetformin, which lowers blood glucose\nDrugs that raise insulin (to indirectly suppress blood glucose)\n\n\nBoth of these groups have the same amount of microvascular outcomes (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy)\nBut the higher insulin treatment groups get more macrovascular diseases (coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease)\nThis suggests that insulin is playing a bigger role on the macrovascular disease, and the glucose is playing the role in the microvascular disease\n\nIn the case of SGLT-2 inhibitors…\n\nThey are the first drugs to have really shown a profound impact on cardiovascular diseases, says Jake\nEmpagliflozin, for example, which directs glucose to the urine and therefore reduces circulating insulin, reduces cardiovascular diseases by 40%\nJake cites the work of Cynthia Kenyon (see the “Selected Links” section for more)\n\nLessons learned from Peter’s patient with T1D\nJake believes there’s something to learn from people like Peter’s patient who has type 1 diabetes:\n\nLow BMI\nVery active\nLow doses of insulin\n\n“And I just wonder whether carrying out these tricks to try to reduce your circulating insulin could be incredibly beneficial.”\nThe two dream measurements Peter wishes were available [2:04:00]\n\nFirst, metabolic signature for autophagy\nSecond, a way to measure the amount of insulin made by your pancreases over the previous 24 hours (a.k.a.
