  "title": "#133 – Vinay Prasad, M.D., M.P.H: Hallmarks of successful cancer policy",
  "content": "Vinay Prasad is a practicing hematologist-oncologist who doubles as a “meta-researcher,” studying the quality of medical evidence, health policy, and clinical trials. In this episode, Vinay discusses the differences in clinical treatment from the existing medical evidence, often leading to useless, or even harmful, outcomes for patients. With a focus in oncology, he takes a deep dive into the field’s structural problems, which include the disconnect between progress and funding, drug costs, and financial conflicts of interest. He concludes with his “six hallmarks of successful cancer policy” as a potential roadmap to sustained progress against cancer and a way to avoid repeating the policy and practice mistakes of the past.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#133 - Vinay Prasad, M.D., M.P.H: Hallmarks of successful cancer policy\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#133 - Vinay Prasad, M.D., M.P.H: Hallmarks of successful cancer policy\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#133 - Vinay Prasad, M.D., M.P.H: Hallmarks of successful cancer policy\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nVinay’s background and unique perspective [3:15];\nMedical reversal—the disconnect between research findings and clinical applications in medicine [10:15];\nThe uniquely challenging field of oncology [22:45];\nThe importance of bedside manner with cancer patients [30:00];\nStructural problems in oncology—Problem #1: Huge costs for small improvements [37:00];\nStructural problems in oncology—Problem #2: Medical reversal—when medical practices are adopted based on low levels of evidence [40:15];\nStructural problems in oncology—Problem #3: Slow progress in cancer research (despite all the hype and propaganda) [45:00];\nStructural problems in oncology—Problem #4: The burden of payment is not matched with those making treatment decisions [54:45];\n“No-brainer” moves in oncology [1:06:45];\n“Fool’s gold” treatments in oncology [1:09:30];\nThe six hallmarks of successful cancer policy [1:16:00];\nCancer policy hallmark #1: Independence [1:18:00];\nCancer policy hallmark #2: Evidence [1:28:15];\nCancer policy hallmark #3: Relevance [1:31:30];\nCancer policy hallmark #4: Affordability [1:32:00];\nCancer policy hallmark #5: Possibility [1:47:00];\nCancer policy hallmark #6: Agenda [1:52:00];\nTumor genome sequencing and liquid biopsies [1:54:30];\nVinay’s clinical philosophy, being skeptical without being too contrarian, and practicing medicine without perfect information [2:03:30];

It was an intense place. “\n“I remember yelling in the operating room was common, throwing things was common, people getting chewed out was common.”\n\n\n\nThe medical school experience\n\nThere is a relevant book called Forgive and Remember written by a sociologist from Penn, Charles Bosk. Bosk spent 18 months late ’70s / early ’80s with a group of surgical residents to understand the culture of surgical training; the place not named but was likely Chicago, very toxic environment\n\nPeter says, “There’s a real east coast / west coast divide in medical education. … when I applied to my residency on the east coast at Hopkins, there was a real view that no one from Stanford could go there and do general surgery because the last guy who had gone and done general surgery who had come from Stanford had committed suicide.”\n\n\nVinay did not really like med school, especially the first two years in the classroom where the focus was on memorization.\n\n“Those first two years I found it really demoralizing. I wasn’t somebody who was used to memorizing lots of things in a disconnected way, I was somebody who liked to think about things and think about them rigorously.”\n“It was only when third year started and I was there on the wards, and I was on internal medicine first as my clerkship, and I had some really great and influential practitioners of medicine who would teach me how they think about cases, that was when I started to feel okay. That’s the first moment that this felt like the right choice for me.”\n\n\n Assumed he’d practice clinical medicine in a private practice\n\n \nMedical reversal—the disconnect between research findings and clinical applications in medicine [10:15]\n\nVinay finished medical school with the belief that he was going to pursue private practice\nBut that started to change in residency where he saw disconnect between clinical situations and research findings:\n\n\n“There were things we were doing that were not supported by strong evidence, there were some things that appeared to run counter to the best evidence. It didn’t make a lot of sense to me.” – Vinay Prasad\n\nThis realization began his foray into medical research\n\nHe started doing studies on ineffective practices that had become part of medical culture, termed “medical reversal,” and has published papers about it\n“I got into it from the point of view of a clinician who was struggling to make sense of what was going on around me, and that was really how I fell into research. I didn’t know that research would become my career, but the funny thing about life is you do something long enough and it starts to define you. …Eventually it starts to turn into a career.”\n\nStents — An example of medical reversal\n\nSome indications are questionable, which is problematic if patients suffer a complication\n\nA stent is a little flexible metallic tube that expands and is placed in a coronary artery when there is a blockage\nIn a critical situation, a stent is a transformative, life-saving intervention (an AST elevation-related myocardial infarction, a total blockage of the artery)\nBut it can also be used more broadly\n\n\nWhat about somebody who just has a little bit of narrowing of the arteries and maybe just a touch of angina? \n\nAngina is the reproducible chest pain that comes on when you shovel your driveway or go for a long walk\nCan’t just extrapolate from a critical situation to a less severe situation\nBut less severe situations are much more common than severe ones, so they are a big driver of market share\n\n\nStents became very popular for chronic stable angina\n\na large, mega randomized control trial called Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) asked whether or not stents lower the rate of heart attack or improve longevity\nfor people with chronic stable angina, there was no improvement in survival and no reduction in subsequent myocardial infarction\nYet patients receiving stents thought that it was being done to improve survival or to reduce risk of later MIs \n“There was a disconnect between what patients felt it was for, and what doctors knew it could do.” \n\n\nStents have complications: cardiac arrest occlusion of the stent, a thrombus that forms within this foreign body\n\n\n“All things in medicine have some complications, but the question that plagued me was it’s okay to accept the risk of a complication if the procedure has a net benefit, but if the procedure is questionable as it’s being done and the benefit is questionable, you’re just taking risks without any upside.” – Vinay Prasad\n\n\n\n\nThis issue motivated Vinay to look deeper and understand why doctors do what they do\n\n\nPeter: there are conflicts of interest in medicine, like interventional cardiologists being compensated for the number of stents being placed.\n\n“If I were in their situation I’m not sure how I would self-police.”\nNot bad people but, like all of us, suffer from their own cognitive biases\n\n\nIn this case, there are two parts to the equation that make stents so seductive\n\n1) patients are happy to have a stent because they believe the doctor has saved or extended their life. They may even believe they feel better\n2) Doctors also earn more money for each stent they do\n\n\n“When you combine that powerful, psychological stimulus of gratitude with a little bit of financial remuneration, I think that’s the methamphetamine of being a doctor.” \nBut then the Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Stable Angina (ORBITA) study says that when patients thought they had a stent but didn’t, they actually had the same exercise tolerance improvement on a treadmill test as those who got a stent\n\nThis can be hard for doctors to accept: it doesn’t fit with their experience or the way they’ve been paid. It becomes very hard to dispel established practices\n\n\n\nMedical reversal beyond just stents\n\n“The moment you start to recognize some of the classic research pitfalls, the evidence pitfalls, you … start to see it everywhere.” – Vinay Prasad\n\n\nOne theme is “mechanical interventions done to alleviate a subjective symptom” like angina or pain or dyspnea—Studies suggest this is a placebo effect, no better than a sham intervention\nSham interventions not commonly done anymore, but once were\n\nFor example, with degenerative osteoarthritis of the knee, can do surgery to debride the cartilage, which might get better results than PT or taking ibuprofen. But if you just put scope in but not actually do anything, patients still report feeling better. So it’s not the surgery but the idea that something is being done for them.\nThis has also been shown true for other procedures: injecting polyacrylamide cement into osteoporotic fractures of the vertebra, a couple of shoulder procedures\n\n\nAlso with stenting chronic stable angina (ORBITA trial)\nPeter asks: In ORBITA did they actually cannulate the femoral artery?\n\n\nThey cannulated the artery and performed a diagnostic angiogram\nBut patient had headphones so didn’t know if got stent\nprimary outcome that they’re looking at is the modified Bruce protocol treadmill exercise test\nThe difference was 16 seconds, and it’s not statistically significant, and it’s not clinically meaningful\n\n\nNow Vinay is in oncology and hematology and doesn’t get to see other specialties as often\n\n \nThe uniquely challenging field of oncology [22:45]\n\nAt Chicago, had really good mentors in internal medicine and many students chose it\n\nWanted to have a broad look at the body and think broadly\nConsidered a few other specialties like cardiology and critical care\n\n\nHad a great experience with oncologists at Northwestern\n\nOne was Hidayatullah Munshi, who’s still there on faculty: he knew basic science, clinical trials, and evidence, and also had great a bedside manner\nVinay saw them making decisions he thought were “substantive and important” and decided to go into oncology too\n\n\n\nTell me about your first days as a medical oncology fellow when you’re seeing multiple things (GI cancers, liquid cancers, etc.) again. \n\nVinay went to the National Cancer Institute, it’s a unique and fascinating program\nInternal medicine doesn’t teach you much about oncology—so steep learning curve, new drugs, diseases, genetics.\n\n“To be honest I probably think that’s one of my favorite years of training, my first year as an oncology fellow. … We were learning 20 new things every day. I thought it was really a terrific and transformational year for me.”\n\n\nPeter says NCI is a special place: “It’s not hyperbolic to say there’s no place like it on earth. I still remember that first day I stepped foot on that campus as a third year medical student just thinking, how can this place exist? It is so marvelous.”\n\nA lot of fundamental work took place there\nAnyone training in medicine should spend some time there\n\n\n\nThe challenge of oncology as a field\n\nOncology is challenging because what we call “cancer” is really very dissimilar diseases\nThere is variation even within cancer types \n\nExample: non-small cell lung cancer, which itself is a category of lung cancer, can be further divided into categories like EGFR mutation type, ALK rearrangement type, RET, and ROS1\nWe have all these molecular categories, we have RAS, this undruggable target. We have superimposed that with the role of immunotherapy.\n\n\nTo keep up, Vinay reads an article or two every night, reads Up to Date and looks at the references\n\nStill so much he doesn’t know\n “I once heard somebody say 1963 was the last time a scientist died who knew everything. It’s just impossible to know it all.”\n\n\nHe sees patients about half the time and bases what he needs to learn off that\n\nStart with the patient and work your way outward, he’s still learning 6 years into practice\n\n\n\n \nThe importance of bedside manner with cancer patients [30:00]\n\nPeter observes that bedside manner is important, but there is tension between how draining medicine is for the doctor and the need to connect with patients\n\n\n“I think there is a misconception among many people outside of oncology that oncology is often doom and gloom, and tough situations. … We also have many patients in whom we cure and we have to follow for long-term side effects.” – Vinay Prasad\n\nAn anecdote to provide some perspective:\n\nVinay tells a story about a senior oncologist who’d been practicing for 30 years talking with a patient he’d seen for more than a decade.  The patient had reached a point where no more could be done for him.\n\n“I go into the room and he does what would be the stuff of legend. He’s compassionate, he’s caring, he’s hearing the patient, he’s seeing the patient, he’s keeping a little bit of distance, he’s giving the information he needs to give, but he’s also giving the emotional support he needs to give as well. It’s very hard for me to even describe how he did it. It felt like magic to me as a trainee.” And the patient thanked the doc for taking care of him all of those years.  It was “a rare privilege moment of being a doctor.”  \nVinay asked doc how he did such a good job with those hard situations, and doc said he tried to get better every year – never allowed himself to become complacent.\n\n\nOncology is not just prescribing the right meds, it’s also being there for your patients – part of what makes field interesting and satisfying\n\nPeter worked with a doctor who did not allow residents to say a patient failed the medicine, only that the medicine had failed them \nPeter’s mentor Steve Rosenberg said, “Patients who are dying need us more than patients who are living.” \n\n\n\n \nStructural problems in oncology—Problem #1: Huge costs for small improvements [37:00]\n\nOne year at the National Oncology Conference everyone was celebrating a new drug\n\nYet, the median survival before drug was about 6 months, and the drug extended it to 11 months but didn’t cure it\nA non-doctor friend of Vinay’s pointed out how inadequate that was and told him medicine needed to do better than that. Was eye-opening for Vinay\n\n\nIn 71 consecutively approved drugs for solid cancers, as a famous study showed, the average improvement was 2.1 months.\n\nAnd the cost of those meds is 100,000 to $200,000 per year of treatment, need to take it for 8-10 months to get the two-month benefit\n\n\n“Why are we spending so much money on these drugs that appear to offer less than what we would want and hope for for our patients? … Why aren’t there fewer, but better drugs coming? What are the sort of structural problems in this space that create a glut of often me-too drugs? … And so that was … one of the core questions that started me on this path.” \n Vinay’s book Malignant is about cancer drug research and policy: “I realized that there’s a story that could be told across all these different domains and that it makes more sense when you tell the whole story. And so that’s why I decided to write that book.”\n\n \nStructural problems in oncology—Problem #2: Medical reversal—when medical practices are adopted based on low levels of evidence [40:15]\n\nVinay looked at clinical situations that didn’t seem to match the best available evidence \nHe and Adam Cifu asked: how many medical practices are adopted based on low levels of evidence, how they were adopted, and what happens if later evidence shows they are not effective?\nThey weren’t just replaced by something better, but reversed, so they termed them medical reversals: when either doing nothing or doing what had been done in an earlier time was actually better than the current practice\nLed to the book Ending Medical Reversal\n\nSome examples of medical reversal:\n\nHormone therapy\n\nSince premenopausal women have low rates of heart CV events but postmenopausal women don’t, maybe estrogen is protecting them and we should give it to postmenopausal women (drug company Wyeth was instrumental in driving prescriptions of hormone replacement therapy)\nThere seemed to be a lot of evidence supporting this (basic science and observational studies) \nBut in early 2000s, a randomized controlled trial called the Women’s Health Initiative randomly assigned postmenopausal women to estrogen supplementation or not. The study was stopped early because of an increase in thromboembolic and cardiovascular events; seemed to do opposite of what it was thought to do\n\n\nPremature ventricular contractions (PVCs)\n\nPost MI, EKGs show PVCs, and the more a patient has the more likely they are to have sudden cardiac death. Led to the idea that PVCs could precipitate cardiac arrest.  So gave drugs that suppress PVCs \n But when they did a randomized trial (CAST), it turned out that the drug increased the risk of dying. Docs didn’t even want to do trial because they thought it unethical not to give some patients the drug.  (These studies have led to the abandonment primarily of Class Ic antiarrhythmic agents like flecainide)\nThe advocates of this treatment were backed up by “plausible pathophysiology” and a retrospective observational story, but it was still wrong. \n\n\nThis made Vinay wonder if it had happened elsewhere\n\n\n“We started investigating. Now we have lists of hundreds of items. They span everything from ways in which we screen patients, ways in which we test patients, drugs we give patients, procedures we do on patients, surgeries you do on patients. It really spans the gamut. There have been these medical reversals across broad domains of medicine. They are quite common.” – Vinay Prasad\n\n\nPeter wants to point out that “the WHI is arguably the worst study that’s ever been done” and that it can be challenging to figure out whether your own patient is represented in a study population. The biggest WHI headline was that HRT increased breast cancer, which later turned out not to be a correct conclusion.  It also raised questions about the difference between relative risk and absolute risk. Now back to oncology …\n\nHere’s a paper indicating that WHI’s initial conclusions about breast cancer had been wrong\n\n\n\n \nStructural problems in oncology—Problem #3: Slow progress in cancer research (despite all the hype and propaganda) [45:00]\n\nPeter tells his patients that there are three broad pillars of disease: 1) cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, 2) cancer, and 3) neurodegenerative disease.\n\nThe foundation of metabolic disease (hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes) makes these three disease processes get a lot worse\n\n\nPeter points out that we’ve really only had any success against CVD\n\nyou have a much better chance of surviving a heart attack now that you did in 1960 (advanced cardiac life support, better drugs to lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure, stents in patients who are having an MI or immediately after). We now have a greater pathophysiologic understanding of it.\nBut not much improvement in metastatic breast cancer or Alzheimer’s disease, which is hard for people to understand especially given the resources out into it\n\n\nVinay says hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in cancer research. We’ve made great progress on a few diseases like chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but the average patient still has “a very grave prognosis.”\nPeter remembers going to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference and seeing a presentation about a drug that increased survival for about 20 days – at a cost of $38,000 for the extra days.  How do we decide if that’s an appropriate cost?\n\nFirst, the .7 months / 20 days applies to the study subjects, who are not average cancer patients.  They tend to be younger and have fewer comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, CVD, kidney disease, etc.)\n\n“One of my colleagues describes clinical trial patients as somebody who could run a marathon who also happens to have cancer.”\nThey can handle side effects better than the average cancer patient.\n\n\nAnd yet, even in these individuals, the drug only gives them .7 months longer.  A frail patient who can’t handle the side effects won’t even get that much.  Some empirical studies question whether the average American gets any benefit at all from these drugs\n\n\nSorafenib, a drug for liver cancer patients for whom surgery isn’t an option\n\nIt has a median survival of 11 months compared to 8 months with a placebo but got a standing ovation at a national meeting \nResearchers who looked at Medicare data sets found that the median survival for Medicare (Americans over 65) taking sorafenib was 3 months\n“So in other words, in the real world, somebody taking the drug that improves survival lives 50% as long as the person taking a sugar pill in the trial, which just shows you the Grand Canyon of difference between real world patients and clinical trial patients.”\nBenefits evaporate when use them in board populations\n\n\n Peter refers to his recent interview with Azra Raza, who made the same point\n\nClinical trials are the best case scenario “by a log order” based on patient selection\nDrug companies are trying to get the drug approved, so they are motivated to pick the healthiest patients\nYour patient is not likely to be nearly as healthy as the trial subjects: won’t tolerate the drug as well or have the same “physiologic reserve”\n\n\nVinay says “we can’t blame the tiger for being the tiger” – pharma needs to recoup their R&D costs\n\nIf the product is successful they will earn, on average, $12 billion in the next 14 years (with a p of 0.049. But if p = 0.051, you lose a few hundred million dollars, your outlay on the drug\nThey’re going to handpick patients and test against drugs that might be the weakest and not what is typically prescribed. Some trial patients end up getting substandard care \n\n\n\n \nStructural problems in oncology—Problem #4: The burden of payment is not matched with those making treatment decisions [54:45]\n\nIn med school, Peter read about the luminary oncologist Judah Folkman‘s idea to cut off the blood supply to a tumor.  This was a new idea when he proposed it; the usual treatment was surgery, chemo, and/or radiation\n\nSteve Rosenberg and Jim Allison were also working on immunotherapy ideas\nJudah eventually proposed using anti-VEGF (blood growth factor) compounds\n\n\nBevacizumab (Avastin) was the first such drug approved (for colon cancer) \n\nCost about $100K for a year \nHurwitz paper originally led to approval; increased survival by a couple of months on average\nSome countries (like the UK) wouldn’t pay for it because didn’t meet their payment threshold guidelines\n\nquality adjusted life year (QALY) – was about 100K pounds per QALY then\nIn US, insurance companies (government or employer) paid\n\n\nWhen you’re a clinician you do what the patient wants, base toxicity on whether it’s worth it to the patient \n\nMight be different than what a national policy should be\n\n\n“Every dollar spent on Avastin is a dollar not spent on a lot of healthcare interventions that may have better bang for your buck.”\n\nAvastin for 100 people might equal getting 100K people to take their lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide (blood pressure medications) more religiously\nThey might exceed the benefit of Avastin in terms of life years added “by an order of magnitude”\n\n\n\n\nWhen we pay for our own healthcare, we should get what we want.  But if society pays, consider the common good because healthcare is considered a human right\n\nThis can mean making tough decisions… E.g., Instead of giving cancer drug that extends survival for a few months to 20 people, give pregnant women access to something that might benefit future generations\n\n\nAll countries have to grapple with the question of how to spend limited resources\n\nBut other countries have open discussion about rationing\n\n\n\n\n“In the US we do ration, but we ration in a way you don’t see because some people don’t get anything. … And so we rationed by discriminating against people. That’s a different type of rationing. It’s cruel and irrational, but it is rationing nonetheless.” – Vinay Prasad\n\n\nIf people spent their money as they chose, might not choose this drug for themselves if it meant more money for their kids, but they could choose it [(00:59:46]\nIf spending society’s money, more obligation to make sure you’re getting a clear benefit\n\nHow does Vinay’s philosophy background shape his thinking on these issues? \n\nVinay often uses utilitarianism – doing greatest good for the greatest number of people – as a framework. This approach would suggest not paying for expensive cancer drugs with minimal lifespan extension\n\nPeople criticize the UK for having worse cancer outcomes than the US (may be overstated), but they have better life expectancy. Care might be better there \nSome people might value end-of-life care regardless of how it impacts others\n\n\nDeontological perspective: saying don’t use Avastin is not saying don’t treat the patient – there are other options\nPeter has an American friend who lives in Saudi Arabia.  He spends summers in the US but leaves on the AC in his apartment in Riyadh all summer. About ten years ago it only cost him $4/month for all the extra energy because it’s subsidized by the government. He would never do that in the US\n\nPeter says “when we don’t have skin in the game, we are incapable of making rational cost decisions.”\nYou chose very differently when you only have to pay a fraction of the price\n\n\nThe question is how to reconcile doctor and patients not having skin in the game with the fact that costs of these cancer drugs are so high when it’s not clear how to make them have any \n\nif you only pay 5% of the price of a car, you’ll get a McLaren\nBut what if you pay 5% for the price of the car, but you never actually get the car and you don’t get to drive the car? You just get told how good the car is and are not in a position to judge how good the car is\n\n\nPeople think that if there is any benefit, and they hear someone else is paying, “I’ll try the drug”. But these drugs have downsides that patients might not be aware of – they might even have a net downside\n\n1) they don’t actually improve survival\n2) they may have an opportunity cost: patients end up tethered to a hospital and infusion machine for their last months rather than doing more meaningful things with their remaining time. Might be spending 40% of their extra life in the clinic lobby\n\n\nPeople make choices at odds with drugs’ actual benefits\nThey might be better off if we did not promote options that are not in patients’ best interests\n\n \n“No-brainer” moves in oncology [1:06:45]\nWhat do you think are the “no regret” moves in oncology today?\n\n1: surgery to remove localized cancers  \n\nNot much different for the last 50 years\nAlthough some procedures (like Whipple) have improved\nAnd, as with radical mastectomies, now more localized surgeries are often done \n\n\n2: radiotherapy\n\nreally useful in many situations \nlike the Michael Douglas case: localized in head and neck\nAnything stage  4A or better has “a great shot of a long-lasting cure with chemoradiotherapy”\n\n\n3: drugs\n\nHodgkin’s Lymphoma can be cured with a four-drug combination\nDrugs can cure 95% of patients with testicular cancer that has spread\n\nPeter asks: even seminomatous types?\nDepends on the subtype, sometimes need a combination of both chemotherapy and surgical therapy (e.g., for teratoma) \n\n\nChronic myeloid leukemia (CML): the transformative Gleevec story\n\nPeter points out that some will argue that CML is not cancer\n\nIt’s a blood-based cancer \n\n\nFind it sooner because can be detected with blood test\nSole driver is essentially BCR- ABL fusion, a genomic event\n\nIf you give a drug that inhibits that fusion event, change life expectancy from 3-4 years to normal\n\n\nIn a Swedish dataset, they’re living until a year shy of normal life expectancy. That is a tremendous advance in medicine\n\n\n\n\nIn summary: the no-brainers are when there’s some benefit and the toxicity is low or when there’s a benefit but the toxicity is reversible (giving you a chance to at least try it) \n\n \n“Fool’s gold” treatments in oncology [1:09:30]\n\nBut some things are much more dubious\n\ncaustic, toxic treatments with long-term toxicity\n\n\nPatients are in a very difficult position – they don’t know all the science or how to think about the data.\n\n\n“[Patients are] in a vulnerable position. Their life is on the line. And that’s not always a great position to make choices. And people often tend to make choices that may not be compatible with their best interests.” – Vinay Prasad\n\n\nDecision-making is a thorny process; sometimes there is pressure to make certain decisions from family members\n\nWhat’s an example of something currently getting a lot of attention that might not run out to be a significant advance? Cell-based therapies for immunotherapy? Or maybe checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda?\n\nThe cell-based therapies (things like CAR T cells) have a lot of promise and show great responses in some people, but it’s not clear how wide a range of conditions they will benefit \nFor multiple myeloma, get remission but it doesn’t last (different than what we found with lymphoma and with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL)\nKeytruda trial results have been mixed\nSo it’s on a case-by-case basis depending on cancer and patient\n\nVinay’s example: pancreatic cancer \n\nSome patients have a germline mutation in the BRCA gene that confers susceptibility to cancers (breast as well as pancreas)\nPancreas Cancer Olaparib Ongoing (POLO) trial: a randomized trial that gave people a minimum of four months of the standard of care (FOLFIRINOX therapy), then randomized to Olaporib or sugar pill\n\nOlaparib had a progression-free survival benefit compared to sugar pill, but no overall survival benefit. \ncontrol arm shouldn’t have been sugar pill, it should have been continuing FOLFIRINOX\n\n\nDrug costs about $12,000 a month\nSounded good because it was a targeted drug based on genomic signature unique to individual tumor, but was not better than traditional chemotherapy\nAn example of hype being greater than benefit\n\nProgression-free survival\n\nOften interpreted in the lay press as the time it takes for cancer to get worse, which is not quite right\nIt is the time from when a patient enrolls on a study to one of four things happening:\n\n1) death.\n2) a new lesion on a CAT scan\n3) tumor gets 20% bigger (arbitrary cut point) \n4) tumor gets smaller, then bigger (it could then be 20% from the smallest it ever was) \n\n\nOften trials are driven by the latter two events. The tumors look 120% bigger.\nAlso, measuring on a CAT scan is not like measuring your height – it’s much less precise and doctors don’t always agree about where the tumor ends and where the normal tissue begins\nGoing back to POLO trial:  the only thing the drug improved was progression-free survival, “which is an arbitrary line in the sand for tumor growth” and tell you if people are living longer or feeling better \n\n \nThe six hallmarks of successful cancer policy [1:16:00]\nCan you walk us through your six hallmarks and explain what they mean?\n\nThe Six Hallmarks of Cancer\n\nProposed by Hanahan and Weinberg in probably one of the most cited papers in oncology\nIncludes the biological hallmarks such as invasion of the basement membrane, poor immune surveillance, angiogenesis, etc.\n\n\nVinay thought of also distilling cancer policy into six essential hallmarks as well\n\n \nCancer policy hallmark #1: Independence [1:18:00]\n\nThis hallmark is about conflicts of interest\nIndustry ties to those who should be watching: it funds patient advocacy groups, rotating door with industry and FDA, most expert oncologists get drug funding and sometimes support questionable drugs\nDrug reps buy residents lunches, unique pens, etc.  It’s small but a hook, the beginning of a slippery slope\n\n Peter asks: have things changed in the last 20 years? I assume that pharma is not allowed in the hospital anymore.\n\nIn some but not every place\n\n\n“There is evidence that shows even so much as a meal that is paid for by the industry is associated with a statistically significant, but very small, increase in prescribing patterns. So it is a strategy that pays dividends.” -Vinay Prasad\n\n\n\n\nThese problems have largely been curtailed through a number of well-intentioned efforts\n\n\nBut reform has focused too much on the low end – pens, meals – than on the high end (e.g., oncologists who get $100K+ per year in funding, even millions in research funding)\n\nEven when controlling for research funding, prior publications, and seniority, Vinay found that “personal payments from the industry are associated with greater publication in the future.” \n\n“It’s likely it’s a positive feedback loop. Working with the industry helps your career, which helps you work with the industry, which helps your career.”\n\n\nGuidelines written by people making large amounts of money from industry.  And the guidelines, by law in the US, make Medicare pay for drugs for off-label purposes.\n“So those relationships, I think, are, in order of magnitude, more concerning than the hungry resident taking a meal. In fact, I try not to talk too much about those sort of little things.”\nThe solution is not to set hard rules with punishments, because that doesn’t change behavior\n\n\nInstead create a different set of incentives\n\nWe still need guidelines to help decide what to cover off label. Why don’t we incentivize people who don’t have conflict to join those guidelines?\nWhat if we had rules and policies that favored faculty members who didn’t take money from the industry to be on the guidelines? Suddenly career incentives look very different.\n\nPerhaps should have to make choice between drug consulting and sitting on a guidelines committee\nSo change incentives: “create opportunities for academics to not take money and still have robust and rich careers.”  Right now all opportunities are tied to taking money from the industry\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there evidence that physicians are, for the most part, honestly disclosing these things? I know there was a very famous case at Memorial Sloan Kettering, where there was a huge blow up over this. So if a system like the one you described were in place, do we think that we could believe people?\n\navailable evidence suggests that disclosure is incomplete and often inaccurate\n\nmany people don’t even believe they have a conflict\n\n\nJosé Baselga: did not mention highly relevant conflicts in many articles\n\nPushed out of  Memorial Sloan Kettering\nBut became vice president of the drug company AstraZeneca, a job that likely pays a few times as much money as he was making earlier.  Not exactly a punishment\n\n\nWe don’t really take disclosure seriously\nSome psychology / business evidence suggests that if someone discloses you might actually trust them more\nDivestment is a better way\n\nSay a drug costs $100,000 a year and alters the (somewhat subjective) tumor size on CAT scan but we don’t know if it increases lifespan or improves quality of life\nWho decides whether or not we should recommend that routinely or not? The guidelines will shape how many doctors practice and they should be made by doctors without a conflict of interest\n\n\n“It’s like a courtroom where the prosecutor and the defense are both being paid by the defendant”\nWe need profit to drive innovation, but it needs to be separated from the people who are supposed to monitor and push back on drug companies\n\nWhat is the opposition to this idea? \n\nThe people who are best in the position to fix the situation are the ones who are personally getting the most money \n\nOur professional societies and senior leadership at universities and academic medical centers are driven by industry payments\n\n\n\n\n“I think it’s hard in any system where the people you need on your side to change the system, the people with the power, are the ones benefiting most from the system” – Vinay Prasad\n\n\nMost people rationalize their actions, seeing themselves as products of their circumstances and not an unethical person\nThe real way to fix this problem is to have somebody external to the medical profession come in and do it \n\n \nCancer policy hallmark #2: Evidence [1:28:15]\n\nMeasure what matters and do it fairly\n\nwhen we give cancer drugs, we care about two things: increased survival or health related quality of life.\n\n\nIn our current system: \n\nOne third of approved drugs shrink tumors more than 30% in a fraction of people\nOne third delay tumor growth by 20%\nOne third allow you to live longer and/or better.\nSo we’re spending all this money on costly drugs, but only about a third actually affects what actually matters to people. The other two thirds you’re measuring tumor size on CAT scans.\n\n\n\nWhy do we use tumor shrinkage of 30% as a cutoff?\n\nGoes back to a 1976 paper where oncologists measured marbles under foam rubber with calipers\n\nThe size difference at which two doctors could reliably tell the marble had gotten bigger or smaller became the cut point\nAnd that cut point is what we still use today\n\n\nSo why put so much stock in drugs with a 10 or 20% response rate? Cutoffs are arbitrary and tell you nothing about whether patient lives longer or better\n\nDoes this mean that two thirds of the treatments out there go in the waste bin?\n\nThey won’t be approved at the same moment in time. It would change a lot of things in the industry\nWould do more trials in patients with relapsed cancer because that’s where the event rate is highest\nCompanies would be more selective about drugs they advance in the process\n\nWould it actually change the number of drugs that come to market? \n\nWe’ll likely have fewer but better drugs coming to market\n\n \nCancer policy hallmark #3: Relevance [1:31:30]\n\nNeed more studies done on subjects who are more representative of average Americans\nNeed to study average people to see if the drugs work as they will be prescribed\nWill reduce drug success rates due to both decreased tolerability and actual poor response [but ones that make it to market are likely to be more effective for the average patient]\n\n \nCancer policy hallmark #4: Affordability [1:32:00]\n\nAffordability is a thorny problem\nVinay has written a number of review articles that have looked at many different solutions; here he will just put them into buckets\n\nTwo kinds: solutions that rely on existing legal structures vs. those that require novel legal structures.\n\n\nIf a drug is approved in the US, Medicare has to pay for it and can’t negotiate the price\n\nIt also has to pay for any drug recommended at a level 2A or higher by guidelines (like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s), by many people writing the guidelines are funded by the industry\n\n\n We should give Medicare the ability to decline to pay for drugs \n\nYears ago, a couple of states asked Seema Verma and colleagues at HHS to let states make different standards for what Medicare would pay for, but no experimentation at the state level was allowed\nWe should encourage state-level experimentation to explore new ways to bring down drug prices\n\n\nAlso are a number of technical solutions\n\n\n“A drug that you cannot actually get in the hands of somebody is no better than no drug at all.” – Vinay Prasad\n\n\nMany drugs, for the most part, are out of reach of billions and billions of people \n\nThere are some drugs that are transformative but the best centers globally do not have access\nExample:  Trastuzumab, a drug developed in the late 1990s for a certain type of breast cancer \n\nAn Indian study found that only a small number of people who were eligible for that drug had access\n\n\n\n\n\nDo we have a sense of on average, how much more a drug costs in the United States than, say, in Europe or Asia? \nAbout 50% of pharmaceutical spending in the world comes from the US even though we account for maybe 4% of the world’s population \nDo we know how much of that is volume versus price? \n\nPeter says it seems like the US has a “deal” with the pharmaceutical industry that it will do most R&D in the US, so the US basically subsidizes the cost for the world in exchange for first access to the drugs\nIf you compare the US and Norway, which have comparable GDPs, we pay roughly double what Norway pays for cancer drugs\nWe should ask why we subsidize marginal drugs the same way we subsidize transformative drugs\n\nFor example,  Avastin has multiple approvals for many different tumor types.  It has a median survival of about one to two months without curing the disease. Global lifetime earnings are close to $100 billion.\nAnother example: Gleevec. It doesn’t cure everybody, but works dramatically well when it does. Lifetime earnings in the several billions and billions of dollars.\n\n\nMarginal drugs \n\nToxic drugs that don’t do that much and still can accrue billions of dollars\n\n\nTo correct the market, incentivize drugs that have more substantive benefits and don’t pay so much for those drugs that really don’t add a lot, don’t cure people and just prolong survival very modestly in very select cohorts\nWhile the cost of innovation is staggering, pharma also grossly overstates the risk they’re taking \n\nResearch has essentially been outsourced to biotech: drug discovery is now a venture capital problem, which means it’s a risk funded by private citizens\nPharma only comes in at Phase 3 after risk reduced, increasing success rate\n\n\n\nWhat’s the knockoff effect of a new system going to be in terms of incentivizing pharma?\n\nPeter says it seems obscene that Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), doesn’t have the ability to negotiate\nBut at the same time, he doesn’t want anybody in the US government making a decision when it comes to healthcare because he no longer trusts them\n\nThere are 550 or 600 people in the US Congress, but maybe 2 of them have science degrees, so they are not the right people to make scientific decisions. Same for the Supreme Court \n\n\n\nSo how do we think about balancing this? \n\nPeter says maybe it would be better to let the states do it so there’s less collateral damage, but that carries its own problems\nthe problem remains unsolved\nCMS as it is provides a kind of incentive: if you can get FDA approval we’ll pay no matter what the cost\n\nNo company wants to be an outlier in this system\nAlso make CMS pay when docs use drugs off label, so companies have incentive to convince doctors to do this\nThe hurdle for a drug is drug approval, and then you can charge whatever you want \ndon’t have to look at cost to bring to market or what the benefit of the drug is\n\n\nhappened with CAR T cells: cost $300K or $400K but justified it because it’s one-time dose and other drugs with more frequent dosing cost $200K a year\n\ncreates cycle of high cost justification\n\n\nThe fact that CMS can’t negotiate is a decision to incentivize approval\n\nHow do drugs get approved?\n\nBar for approval is getting lower and lower – need fewer subjects, some trials don’t have a control arm, etc.\nA drug (Vinay forgets the name) “lowers the rate of a blood protein” but also causes ocular impairment in almost everyone who takes it, in some cases severe\n\nWe don’t know if it makes better live longer or better, but ophthalmology costs are high\nWhy is this drug approved?\n\n\nValue based pricing model:  we should pay more for drugs that provide us more value with more incremental survival benefits\nWith any policy, you will get unintended consequences and people finding unforeseeable paths of least resistance\n\nSome policy experimentation is good to see what works and course correct\n\n\n\nCMS might be 25-35% of insurance in the US, but why haven’t private insurance companies banded together to negotiate prices? \n\nPeter says part of reason is because they don’t bear much risk because majority of their business is probably administrative services only (ASO)\nIf companies don’t cover what CMS covers, they look bad \n\nThere have been many news reports about patients’ personal battles with health insurance companies’ drug coverage denials over the last 30 years\nSmall population that needs drug, so it might be cheaper for them just to pay for the drug than it is to deal with the pushback from not paying for it\n\n\nAffordable Care Act  capped insurance company profit on revenue to 20% profit on revenue (minimum medical loss ratio or MLR) \n\nIf can’t earn more than 20%, have high incentive to make as much as possible\n“So if I tell you you’re really hungry and you can only eat 20% of the pizza, what size pizza should I order? The answer is going to be extra large.”\n\n\n\nWhy do insurers impose pre-authorization requests and other requirements that make things difficult for doctors? \n\nOne, the insurer’s incentive is to make sure year-to-year variability of costs is predictable and that they can model that out and make sure their premiums go where they need them to go to ensure their profit revenues\nAlso, insurers don’t have enough skin in the game to keep costs down, so they really don’t care\n\nPeter thinks it’s the employer that has the most skin in the game\n“But the problem is they’re so disaggregated and so spread out that they can’t speak in a unified way and they can’t fight in a unified way.” \n\n\nAlso a “tragedy of the commons” problem\n\nWhy would one company fund the proper trial if all their competitors will also have access to the info?\nA few companies ran clinical trials for autologous stem cell transplants for breast cancer that ultimately debunked that procedure \n\n\n\n \nCancer policy hallmark #5: Possibility [1:47:00]\n\nThe preclinical pipeline must be expanded\nWe talk about fledgling biotech, the pharmaceutical industry, etc. but forget the role of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in drug development\n\nNIH bears some of the risk, funds some “science for science’s sake,” identifying targets that are then clinically exploited\nWe spend about $30B a year on NIH, but that’s not nearly enough\n\n\n“That science is like the greatest thing that people have ever done, and if I were in charge of anything, I would crank up the funding for science. Because I think science is possibility.”\n\nWe should increase science funding slowly and steadily (if increase it too fast, not used yet used it and will result in waste) \n\nMust separate science from politics – funding should be stable and not dependent on elections\n“science needs slow, steady growth.”\n\n\n\n\nWe give out billions of dollars in research funding but have never really studied how it should be distributed\n\nSome labs are flush with money while others get almost none\nWe need to do some studies on measures of equity of who gets the money, the research satisfaction, burnout, measures of how translation occurs, etc.\n\n\nBlue sky science: where it’s just science for science’s sake\n\nNot aimed at a specific cure but on understanding how things work; very hard to get funding for that.  Shouldn’t be that way\n\n\n\n\n“Some of the greatest advances in science were people who pursued things purely because that interested them and the finding and the translation was serendipitous.” – Vinay Prasad\n\n\nPeter agrees – people who give money at NIH are not really allowed to take big risks\n\nMust go back and show you did x, y, and z to get continued funding.\nMakes sense to avoid waste but also discourages exploration \n\n\nPeter suggests having two research funding arms: \n\ntranslational funding arm that is meant to be incremental: is this ready to go to the next step on a clinical pathway?\nAnother arm for basic inquiry and the advancement of natural knowledge, regardless of where it takes us\n\nsome of the most exciting discoveries in the history of the last 400 years came from nothing other than pure inquiry\n\n\n\n\nPeople thought that some work (like the work of immunotherapy doctor Jim Allison) “was foolish and misguided and that was never going to succeed” \n\nBut the work ultimately led to a blockbuster class of drugs and he won the Nobel prize \n\n\n\n \nCancer policy hallmark #6: Agenda [1:52:00]\nWhat happens when you take a 30,000-foot view of cancer and look at the clinical trials’ agenda? \n\nIn some spaces in cancer medicine, people are running redundant and duplicative trials\n\n“They’re all testing them in the same tumors, in the same setting, with the same old controls.”\n\n\nThere are also many different clinical trials with drugs that have low promise\nBy chance alone, aren’t some of these trials going to be positive?\n\nUsing a non-stringent nominal cutoff for significance (p =0.05)\n\n\nPeter says it’s like you need a Bonferroni correction factor for the number of trials \nVinay wrote a paper where they used a Bonferroni\n\n“We got a lot of pushback from those peer reviewers” \nTotally novel application of how it was used \n\n\n\n\n“Within a study, if you do a lot of comparisons, you take into account the number of comparisons to some degree. … When you’re running many, many studies, shouldn’t you also do the same?” – Vinay Prasad\n\n\nMore a philosophical than a statistical question\nThe most scarce resource in cancer medicine are the patients themselves\n\nFor some tumor types, there are now more trials ongoing than there are people with that condition\n\n\nThe big picture\n\nIt’s like when little kids play soccer – they don’t play positions, they all run after the ball\nLots of people are running duplicative trials\nSomebody has to think about the big picture and recognize what the agenda looks like across the entire field.\n\n\n\n \nTumor genome sequencing and liquid biopsies [1:54:30]\nIs there a role in oncology for tumor genome sequencing?\n\nPeter doesn’t know what to say when people ask his advice about essentially incurable cancers. He doesn’t really have any advice because their oncologist has already said there is nothing more to do\nPeter’s perspective is that there’s nothing wrong with hope, and for a lot of things we don’t know if they work or not\n\nBut ask about the cost, because “I’m certainly pretty squirrely when someone’s offering a panacea treatment for $20,000.” \n\n\nIs there anything out there that’s in the “holistic” world that’s going to work?\nPeter has sent people to Foundation Medicine, but it has never been a game changer\nHe had one dramatic experience: a friend had pancreatic cancer related to Lynch Syndrome, which is more likely to involve checkpoint mutations\n\nGot him into a trial of Keytruda\nHe turned out to be a remarkable responder and has now been cancer-free for almost a decade\n\n\n\nWhat are your views on tumor sequencing, off-label drug use, targeting therapies, that sort of thing?\n\nVinay doesn’t take a strong stance against alternative or complementary therapies as long as 1) they aren’t too expensive, 2) don’t have an opportunity cost, and 3) don’t interfere with his treatment plan\n\nHe gets irritated with docs who “want to die on that hill” and destroy their relationship with a patient\n“At the end of the day, if it doesn’t cost too much, it’s not really too harmful, And somebody really is motivated to do it and it’s not going to interfere with what you want to do, have at it”\nPeter adds that we must recognize there’s a lot we don’t know\n\n\nNext generation sequencing (NGS) and  tumor genomics: some cancer patients need to be tested for mutations\n\nLung cancer\n\nat least six or seven mutations that we now have FDA-approved therapies for\nneed to know about EGFR and ALK (particularly if the person is a younger non-smoker)\n\n\nMelanoma: you need to know about BRAF\nColon cancer: you need to know about microsatellite instability (MSI) high status\nThere are maybe 20 or 30 mutations a good oncologist should know\n\n\nMSI high: no matter what tumor type, that’s something that we have an approved drug for, so it’s quite reasonable to test for it\n\nAppropriate to use NGS to pair your patient with a clinical trial \n\n\nBut sometimes you have gone through the steps and find a mutation that you might have a drug for, but no trial\n\nDo you use the new drug or standard treatment?\n\n\n\n\n“It is so seductive to believe that because we found the mutation and the target, it’s better to use the targeted drug than that older drug that may have a longer track record. And I think that’s where people get into a bit of trouble, that sometimes you actually end up eroding outcomes, not enhancing outcomes. You actually make worse choices in those cases.” – Vinay Prasad\n\n\nSome tumor mutations vary widely by site, so would use different drugs depending on where biopsy was done \nHas also been variation with same tumor sent to different lab companies, which is concerning \nLook for fusion events in people with rare tumors at young ages; important to know about and there are some trials at Sloan Kettering\nIf patient has tried various therapies and we don’t really know about mutations for their tumor, not obligatory to do sequencing:\n\n“be careful that you don’t just gravitate to what is a key in a lock, what sounds like a key in a lock, but it may be sort of taking you away from something that has a better track record.”\n\n\nLiquid biopsies are done for leukemia\n\nWhat about the phase two data on liquid biopsies for solid organ tumors and lymphomas?\n\nLeukemia is always a few steps ahead of everything else because it can be more easily detected and measured volume wise\nThere are a number of approved liquid biopsy tests which will have a role\n\n“If you can find out that mutational information without having to stick a needle in someone, everyone is going to be grateful for that”\nBut ask if the test is sensitive enough in this case: will you still need to do a biopsy? \n\n\nAn advantage of liquid biopsy if that you can track something over time\n\n \nVinay’s clinical philosophy, being skeptical without being too contrarian, and practicing medicine without perfect information [2:03:30]\n\nExample when Vinay took a different stance and others gave him a hard time: the use of dexamethasone for COVID\n“Medicine by press release”\n\nThe drug company Eli Lilly announces top line results are positive, this drug improved outcomes (hazard ratio = 0.7)\nBut the press release did not include how long patients lived or if they had side effects\nPress releases are primarily for shareholders and generally doctors should not be making decisions based on them – need to wait for the paper to get more information\n\n\nA recent UK study found that people who are hospitalized requiring oxygen when their oxygen saturation levels are less than 94% or people who are mechanically ventilated get an all-cause mortality benefit from dexamethasone\n\nBut maybe people who are hospitalized but do not require supplemental oxygen did not benefit\n\n\nDuring COVID, docs were trying everything and doing whatever they could think of for COVID patients\n\nThis particular study’s protocol was available and defined pre-specified endpoints, so Vinay thought the evidence in the press release was enough\n“I like to say a press release and a protocol, that’s like a driver’s license and a social security card. And a paper, that’s like a passport. Do I have to show you my passport? I can show you the other two. It’s another form of identification.”\nHe was criticized by those who thought they should wait for the paper\n\n\nThe best way to keep a balance between skepticism blind acceptance is to go into the clinic, where patients are taking drugs you might be skeptical of \n\nVinay’s clinical philosophy\n\nThe doctor’s role is not to determine what treatment is right for someone, it’s to convey to the patient what they know about the drug: what has and has not been shown, potential benefits, uncertainties, known toxicities and risks\n\nThen walk the patient through the decision-making process so they understand if it’s worth it to them to take the risks\nDifferent people will choose differently\n\n\n\n\n“The more you practice medicine, the more you realize that it’s an art. You’re never going to have perfect information. You’re going to have to make decisions today with less than perfect information.” – Vinay Prasad\n\n\nPeter reflects that the art/science of medicine is very different from a field like experimental physics where you can debate the experimental results\n\nif you’re too much of a skeptic, there’s a cost of doing nothing\nif you blindly accept everything, you are almost unquestionably subjecting patients to unnecessary treatments\n\n\nPeter and his colleagues debate with each other, “but we never lose sight of the fact that it’s not an intellectual pursuit.
