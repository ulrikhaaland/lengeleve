  "content": "Whenever I’m stumped on a patient case, or in my thinking about lipids, Dr. Ron Krauss is one of the first people I turn to for insight. I’m not alone. Ron is recognized globally for his research into lipidology and has worn many hats in his career, including clinician, lipidologist, nutrition, genetics, and drug researcher. He received both his undergraduate and medical degrees from Harvard and is board certified in internal medicine, endocrinology, and metabolism. He’s currently the senior scientist and director of atherosclerosis research at Children’s Hospital in Oakland.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\nMy hope is that both the curious patient and the physician can get a lot out of this episode by being more informed about dyslipidemia and the interventions used to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\tRon Krauss, M.D.: a deep dive into heart disease (EP.03)\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRon Krauss, M.D.: a deep dive into heart disease (EP.03)\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRon Krauss, M.D.: a deep dive into heart disease (EP.03)\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nThe pathogenesis of atherosclerosis;\nHow early atherosclerosis begins;\nRon’s motivation for getting into lipidology;\nHow reading an article series in the NEJM in 1967 had a profound impact on him and his career;\nThe “battle” between LDL particle size and particle number;\nThe use of statins;\nThe role of chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis;\nWhy niacin may have been unjustly dismissed as a therapeutic option;\nThe HDL paradox: why drugs that raise HDL-C seem to elevate (or have little impact on) heart disease risk;\nMendelian randomization: nature’s randomized trial;\nHow PCSK9 inhibitors work and why they may be underutilized;\nLp(a); and\nMore.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEpisodes\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNow playing\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDetails\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#03 - Ron Krauss, M.D.: a deep dive into heart disease\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#03 - Ron Krauss, M.D.: a deep dive into heart disease\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#03 - Ron Krauss, M.D.: a deep dive into heart disease\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nWhenever I’m stumped on a patient case or in my thinking about lipids, Ron is one of the first people I turn to for insight.

Ron is recognized globally for his research into lipidology and has worn many hats in his career, including clinician, lipidologist, nutrition, genetics, and drug research. In this episode, we explore heart disease at its origins before diving into the highly discussed, largely misunderstood, role of LDL and inflammation in atherosclerosis. Ron also shares his insights on the evidence for and against statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. My hope is that both the curious patient and the physician can get a lot out of this episode by being more informed about dyslipidemia and the interventions used to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic disease. We covered a lot of ground on this critically important topic.   We discuss:  The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [7:00]; How early atherosclerosis begins [12:40]; Ron’s motivation for getting into lipidology [43:00]; How reading an article series in the NEJM in 1967 had a profound impact on him and his career [43:30]; How PCSK9 inhibitors work and why they may be under-utilized [47:00]; Mendelian randomization: nature’s randomized trial [49:15]; The “battle” between particle size and particle number [52:00]; The use of statins [1:04:45]; The role of chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis [1:24:15]; Why niacin may have been unjustly dismissed as a therapeutic option [1:40:45]; The HDL paradox: why drugs that raise HDL-C seem to raise (or have little impact on) heart disease risk [1:43:00]; Lp(a) [1:47:45]; And more.

Relative prevalence of familial forms of hyperlipoproteinemia.\nImage credit: Wikipedia\nRon wrote a review article on the history of lipoprotein research (Siri-Tarino and Krauss, 2016). [44:45]\n“Anybody that’s seriously interested in this field,” Ron said, speaking about lipidology, “should probably understand its origins.” Ron said he received an email after the paper was published, from Joe Goldstein, a Nobel Laureate for his work with cholesterol, who told him that everyone who goes into lipid research should read Ron’s paper.\n“The remnants are probably the most pathologic particles of all.” [45:30]\nXanthomas. [46:00]\nPCSK9 and PCSK9 inhibitors. [47:00]\nMendelian Randomization. [49:15]\nLDL particle size and particle number. [52:00]\nSmall and very small LDL and how Ron’s testing a hypothesis that these very small particles may be secreted directly (rather than through the VLDL pathway). [1:01:15]\nCan LDL-C / LDL-P / ApoB be too low? [1:02:30]\nStatins. [1:04:45]\nDementia and desmosterol AUC of the ROC. [Sato et al., 2012; Attia, 2005 for more info on AUC & ROC interpretation] [1:07:30]\nAdverse effects of statins (different types of statins may have different side effects). [1:10:45]\nStatins and diabetes risk. [1:13:00]\nRon was part of a consensus group on statin side-effects. The first paper came out in 2015 (Stroes et al., 2015) on myopathy, and the second one just came out (Mach et al., 2018), and it describes the data related to diabetes, cognitive function, etc. [1:20:30]\nWhat if statins reduce events, but not by lowering LDL? Maybe the benefits come from the endothelial health and/or inflammatory reduction? [1:24:15]\nThere was a trial (Ridker et al., 2017) that said we can make no change to the lipoprotein, we can reduce inflammation (in a subset of patients with an elevated CRP, using canakinumab [the CANTOS trial], a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β), and see a lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events. [1:26:00]\nWe may or may not see the same thing with methotrexate trial (CIRT trial) results (the study was stopped early, not based on any safety concerns) on the horizon. [CardioBrief, 2017] [1:26:00]\nThe JUPITER trial analyzed the associated benefit of LDL-lowering against CRP-lowering, a marker of inflammation. A potential double-whammy. Statins may have a unique ability to hit inflammation and LDL metabolism. [1:27:00]\nHow does Ron rate the strength of the evidence in primary prevention of statins in men and women? MACE and death? [1:29:00]\nStatins and cognitive function. [1:33:30]\nStatins, muscle effects, and adverse effects on the mitochondria. [1:36:30]\nRon’s involvement with the last ATP panel (ATP IV), a part of the NIH, which handed it off to the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology. [Stone et al., 2014] [1:38:00]\nWhy niacin has fallen out of favor, and why Ron still uses it for patients. [1:40:45]\nThe HDL-raising effects of niacin are not protective. That’s the conclusion to take away. [1:43:00]\nHDL function. [1:45:00]\nDoes niacin specifically target smaller LDL particles over larger particles? [1:46:30]\nLp(a). [1:47:45]\nHow statins and PCSK9 inhibitors can widen the discordance between LDL-C and LDL-P, lowering medium- and larger-size LDL particles, and have less of a therapeutic effect on smaller particles, and none on the very small LDL particles.
