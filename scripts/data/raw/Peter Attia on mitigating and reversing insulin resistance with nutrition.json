Nutrition\n\nBy definition, insulin resistance is a carbohydrate tolerance disorder\nAny doctor who is clinically taking care of patients will say insulin resistance patients generally respond better to carbohydrate restriction than any other form of restriction\nThey respond very well to calorie restriction by definition typically includes carbohydrate restriction\nIt doesn’t have to be a ketogenic diet \nRather tell everyone to stay under XXX amount of carbs, Peter sets a standard in terms of average blood glucose and a standard deviation from that average\nPeter uses a Dexcom CGM to monitor this (see podcast episode with Kevin Sayer, CEO of Dexcom)\n\n“As those numbers start to come down and the insulin starts to come down and all these other things start to go, that’s exactly what reversibility looks like.” \n \n§"
