New York\nHe specializes in both routine and complex problems in the upper limb\nAlton was Peter’s surgeon\n\nPeter had shoulder surgery in March of 2022\nHe’s documented that recovery process along the way and promised to do a deep dive on the upper extremity\n\n\nIn this episode we focus on the upper limb\n\nElbow, shoulder, hand, and wrist\nNerves located throughout\n\n\nAlton goes through the structure, anatomy, things that can cause pain and injury, and how and when to think about surgical intervention\nIn addition to our conversation on the podcast, Alton runs through what a typical physical exam looks like\n\nThis is really important\nCertainly surgeons rely on MRI imaging, but any good orthopedist Peter knows has always said the same thing, “The exam and the symptoms matter usually more than what the image shows” \nThis is also something you can do on yourself to understand if something you are feeling is problematic or is going to get better over time\n\n\nThis is one episode you are going to want to watch on video\n\nDue to the discussion of physical exams and sketches of anatomy\n\n\nDue to long length of this podcast, we have broken it out into some specific videos\n\nIsolating the videos of the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, and the innervation\nVideos of the various exams Alton does, demonstrated on Peter\nYou can find all of the videos on the show notes page or YouTube page\n\n\nOne other thing that comes up in this podcast is the foundation he founded, the Musician Treatment Foundation\n\nThis is a nonprofit that provides direct orthopedic shoulder surgery/ hand interventions along with non-surgical care to uninsured/underinsured musicians\nAlton is incredibly passionate about this as he is also a musician\nHe talks about the amazing work he has done so far, where they want to go with it, how they are putting funds to use\nThe foundation has their big annual event in Austin, coming up on Dec. 2 \n\nHead over to their website to learn more\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAlton’s path to orthopedic surgery [3:45]\n\nPeter did general surgery, but outside of trauma, he knows very little about orthopedics\n\nThis it probably true for a lot of doctors\nHow much more is that true for patients?\n\n\nOrthopedics is a broad field and pretty specialized at the same time\nAlton agrees, in medical school we only do a subset of rotations\n\nHe knows nothing about urology, brain surgery\n\n\nIt depends on the luck of the draw, on what we get exposed to\nThen we narrow ourselves down like a funnel in terms of knowledge\nThere has been a knowledge explosion for the past 2 decades in terms of research and new science\nThere are subsets of orthopedics and then there are subsets of shoulder surgery that involves just research versus just clinical practice\nAlton’s well informed patients ask him about things, and hopefully he knows a lot of it, but he doesn’t know all of it\n\nSome of them are very good at looking at true scientific articles and approach him with new articles\nHe is learning every week from his patients about shoulder surgery\n\n\n\nWhen you went to med school, did you think you wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon? \n\nHe didn’t know\nAlton had a very circuitous path\nHe was an engineer at UT in Austin\n\nMechanical and biomedical\nHis dad was an engineer so he went that way\n\n\nAt the end, he wasn’t sure about going into industry\nOn a whim he went to dental school for a year\n\nHe had 2 uncles that were dentists\nHe didn’t like that at all, but he loved the science\n\n\nHe was exposed to the anatomy of the entire body \n\nHis anatomy instructor at dental school was a MD, PhD and when he confided in her that he was leaving, she suggested he try medical school\n\n\nHe came back to Austin, TX and painted houses for a year, then applied to medical school\nIn med school he loved invasive cardiology\n\nAll the aspects of the physiology and the electricity going on in our bodies\n\n\nThen he was exposed to orthopedics and knew he liked it\n\nIt felt so natural putting things together, like a jigsaw puzzle\nIt felt all in perfect line with his engineering background\n\n\n\nAt the time when you went through orthopedics, was it common for people to also do a fellowship after 5 years of residency? \n\nIt was\nHe went to Tulane, this was pre-Katrina\n\nIt was a big program\nThey had 8 residents per year\nAt the time, about 4 going to general practice\n\n\nFellowships were not ubiquitous then\n\nNow they’re almost mandatory because you need to have a special interest because the groups you’d apply to work for want you to have some subspeciality\n\n\nPeter agrees, this is the case in medicine\n\nEven if you did general surgery and didn’t do a fellowship, you’d be hard pressed to go into the community and do everything\nYou’d probably focus on one part of the body\n\n\n\nWhere did you do your fellowship? \n\nUpper extremity\nHe did a shoulder fellowship at Columbia in New York\nThen he did a hand fellowship at Roosevelt Hospital in New York\n\n2 separate fellowships\nMost people didn’t do that at the time, but he just really like both very much\n\n\nHe dabbled with spine during residency\nThe reason he wanted to do upper extremity is because there’s nothing cookie cutter about it\n\nThere were very few cutting jigs, very few linear things\nThere’s so much variability in the upper limb, both anatomy and the specific pathology \nIt was more creative for him\n\n\n\n \nEvolution of orthopedics and recent advances [8:45]\nWhat year did you finish your training? \n\nHe started practice in ‘96\n\nWhen did minimally invasive orthopedic surgery become common for joints?\n\nPeter recalls, there was a day when the shoulder surgery he had would have been done with a big open incision\n\n\nKnee arthroscopy was the first big arthroscopic realm to develop\nDick Asbury was hugely innovative in that space\nShoulder arthroscopy was primitive by the time Alton was in residency\n\nThey had the basic equipment to get into the shoulder, but they couldn’t do much\n\n\nBy the time he finished his shoulder fellowship, they were doing open shoulder arthroplasty\nHe was at one of the meccas of shoulder surgery, so everything advanced was being done there at the level it could be done\nBut it was open shoulder arthroplasty\n\nThe incisions were smaller but it was still open\nThey did open instability repairs, open labral repairs\n\n\nThey didn’t appreciate the slap tear\n\nThey knew it existed, but they didn’t know the impact\n\n\nThere were certainly no arthroscopic repairs of the labrum (see the figure below) except these early devices where you’d get in there, see it, and you’d just drill a little hole and mallet in this big broad tack\n\nThat was just so primitive, and they would fall out\nThey had a high failure rate, but that was the state of the art at that time\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\"

is patients would have a big scar and the surgery would tear a bunch of muscle, so the recovery would be longer\n\nBut, once they got in there, they would know what to do\n\n\nIn contrast, the minimally invasive way that has all these advantages\n\nBut the drawback is a high failure rate\n\n\nThis was the discussion that went on with patients\nThe FDA was involved a little with approval, but not a lot\n\nSo you could go ahead a try these humanitarian devices and so forth \nThe patients had to sign a release and it was all fine\nThere were trusted surgeons that were doing it\n\n\nThere wasn’t clinical trials\nThere were a lot of retrospective analyses going on\n\nWe did this in 107 patients and 47% failed\n\n\n\nThe spectrum of Alton’s work, early on \n\nIn Alton’s early years, they were still doing mostly open surgery and waiting for the industry to catch up with better devices\nSome of his colleagues (and occasionally him) were adding little bitty innovative aspects of these, whether they’re application devices or the style of implants\n\nToday, we’ve gone from purely metal to now often purely braided polyester as an anchor device \n\nThis is super cool because there’s no metal in your body\nAnd the transition through that was plastic\n\nThat plastic could be either hard plastic (which stays in your body), but it’s still benign \nOr a bioabsorbable tacks that Alton has his my own issues with \n\nIt create an inflammatory response in the body \nIt creates a little cavity in the bone and so forth\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we are using tiny drills, tiny suture anchors, and you can put many in \n\nNow if you have to do a revision of some failed repair, you’ve got plenty of real estate to work with (that’s nice)\n\nOne other aspect, which shows how much the field has changed, is that slap tears were not appreciated as a clinically relevant entity \n\nSlap tears were just viewed as another type of labral tear, but a benign one that didn’t matter\nA lot of overhead athletes were coming in with secondary problems as a result of that, and the secondary problems were being treated without treating the underlying stuff\n\nThey were having recurrent pain\n\n\n\n \nAnatomy of the upper extremities [13:30]\n\nPeter thinks to understand and appreciate the complexity of the upper extremity, you have to appreciate what we did during evolution\n\nWhen we stood up, that became an enormous force multiplier\nIf you think about this through the lens of warfare, people talk about having night vision as a force multiplier in war\nFor us to be able to stand and walk with amazing efficiency on two legs was a force multiplier, and then also to have these incredible upper extremities\nBut you pay a price for it, which is stability \n\n\n\nWe paid an enormous price in these joints, not as strong, not as stable \n\nWhen we went from the ball on socket joints or the very stable, simple hinge joints to these cup and saucer type joints (specifically the shoulder, which is intrinsically very unstable) \nOur opposable thumb at the basal joint is terribly unstable\n\nWe call it a biconcave saddle, but it’s barely that\nThere’s really no intrinsic bony stability\n\n\nThe shoulder is similar, Alton uses an analogy that’s slightly off, “A golf ball on a tee”\n\nThe tee is a little bigger, but that’s what it is, very flat and shallow\n\n\nAlton draws quick diagrams for his patients (see the figure below)\nIf we look at just the glenoid‒ that’s the socket, that’s the “golf tee”\nThen you add a humeral head to it\n\nThis portion to the right of the dotted line is what’s covered by cartilage\nThat’s the nice smooth Teflon cartilage in this space\n\n\nFor orientation, if you’re looking straight at a person, this is the right humeral head\nThat little space we’re going to talk about is the glenoid fossa\n\nThis is the flat end of part of the scapula\nThis is a real complex looking triangular bone with a big ridge on it and collarbone attaches to it\n\n\n\n<img

Physiology\n\nThe high level point here is in the hip you have the acetabulum, which creates a true socket for a big ball\n\nAlton drew the hip joint above the right shoulder joint, 3 figures above\n\n\nHere the heavy lifting really is done by soft tissue, not bones\nThe difference between the shoulder and the hip‒ the hip is a joint that is completely contained versus the shoulder, which is a shallow one that can slip and slide all over the place\n\n“The best way to describe the shoulder joint being a delicate balance of mobility and stability, and it’s very easy to get out of whack because it is biomechanically so complicated”‒ Alton Barron\n\nThe space between the humeral head and the glenoid is occupied by a nice thick layer or cartilage on both sides \n\nIt’s effectively articular cartilage there\n\n\nWhen you have arthritis, this gets worn down, chipped away, and begins to fissure, and then actually develop full thickness loss to the point where then at some point it’s not really functioning very well and it’s very painful\nIf we have this basic bony cartilage structure here, it would just fall off if it were just left there if there were no additional stabilizing structures (drawn in Alton’s figure above in red)\n\nSuch as ligaments or labrum or muscle tendons\n\n\n**Peter mentions that ligaments and tendons are not the same\n\nTendons are the connective tissue that connects muscle to bone\nLigaments are connective tissue that connect bone to bone\n\n\n\nIs labrum considered a ligament or is it considered its own entity? \n\nLabrum is kind of its own entity\nIt has a transition zone between fibrous tissue to osseous bony tissue\n\nIt’s a fibro-osseous structure\nAlton likens it to calamari, and it’s rubbery just like that\n\n\nAlton has drawn on 2 of the 4 rotator cuff muscles here\n\nThis is the one up above (supraspinatus muscle)\nThis is the one in front (subscapularis muscle), the big muscle that allows us to reach behind our back and pull our hand away from our back\nThis is also the one that helps us (along with the pectoralis) in front to pull things together (like doing flies and so forth)\n\n\n\nA tear in the supraspinatus tendon \n\nThe supraspinatus is the primary muscle that initiates elevation of the shoulders, so it’s very, very important\nWhat we see here is this zone is where the muscle transitions into tendon (highlighted in green in Alton’s drawing above)\n\nAnd then it becomes pure tendon\n\n\nFor the supraspinatus tendon which is commonly torn, there are some physiologic downsides to its location\n\nIt can be rung out\nIt doesn’t have a great blood supply\nThe key is it gets where those 2 arrows are (in the left of Alton’s drawing earlier) is essentially where the tendon tears most of the time\nAnd that is the part that attaches to the bone, and it gets blood supply from that bone (this includes nutrients and growth factors)\n\n\nSurgically, the goal is to get that reattached to that bone so it can get all of those growth factors and that new healing back\n\n4 muscles that make up the rotator cuff \n\nThe supraspinatus, the subscapularis, the infraspinatus, and the teres minor (shown in the figure below)\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19194\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f5-altonbarron-1024x326.png\"

1024px\" />\nFigure 5.  Muscles in the rotator cuff.  Image credit: Wikipedia\n\nThe infraspinatus, and the teres minor are on the backside of the joint\n\nYou can superimpose them over the subscapularis\nThey are very important as the external rotators\nThey give us our backhand in tennis\nThey give a lot of stability to the shoulder, whether you’re playing golf or lifting weights\n\nThey’re a dynamic stabilizer\n\n\nThey’re very important doing bench press, pushups, archery, all sorts of activities like that\n\n\n\n \nRotator cuff injuries, shoulder joint dislocation, and more [21:15];\nWhen a person “tears their rotator cuff,” that can be a very heterogeneous diagnosis\n\nTechnically it could apply to a tear in any of those 4 muscles\n\nOr a tear in the junction between the muscle and tendon\nOr a complete separation of the tendon from the osseous structure of the bone\n\n\nAlton notes it is critical to identify what the tear is\n\nYou can predict this somewhat based on the age of the person, their physiology, and the mechanism of the trauma\n\n\nTears are broadly classified into degenerative tears and traumatic tears\nFor younger people (under 40), it’s rare for them to tear their rotator cuff\n\nBut it can happen traumatically\n\n\nAlton had a young fellow who worked as a merchant marine years ago, and he was doing something with the anchor and the massive chain and his glove got caught in that\n\nBasically, it almost ripped his arm off\nHe was okay, except that he had torn traumatically as a young 26 year old \n\nIt ripped off 3 of his 4 muscles and they had to be repaired\nBut he was okay\n\n\n\n\nIt’s that rare, dramatic circumstance that leads to traumatic tears in young people\n\nWhere is the weak link in someone that young? Does it tear at the muscle itself or more at the tendon? \n\nThe younger you are, the strong the linkage of the tendon to the bone\n\nYou often pull off some bone\n\n\nIn the case of a skier’s thumb (a common injury in the hand from skiers), the younger you are, the more likely it is to pull off with a piece of bone\nAnd that’s actually great because bone heals to bone much better than tendon to bone\n\nFracture of the greater tuberosity in the shoulder joint \n\nThere are fractures that occur that involve this area of the shoulder\n\nAlton draws a common fracture with a squiggly line, highlighted in yellow in the figure below\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19195\"

1024px\" />\nFigure 6.  A fracture of the greater tuberosity in the shoulder joint.  Sketched by Alton Barron\n\nAlton drew a chunk of bone coming off \n\nThat’s the greater tuberosity‒ it’s a prominence of the bone that the biggest portion of the rotator cuff attaches\n\n\nThe supraspinatus and the infraspinatus pulls off\nAlton would rather pull that off and you have a good quality repair than have 2 tendons rip off that bone\n\nWhat type of athlete or person presents with this type of injury? \n\nThat isolated greater tuberosity is generally a fractured dislocation\nYou have a pretty violent injury\n\nYour rock climbing, you fall off, you maybe hit it directly, your arm is wrenched back\nOr let’s say a football player has a traumatic dislocation; they’re hit in just the right way mechanically, and it shears that off\n\n\nIt’s most often associated with the dislocation (subluxation of the shoulder)\n\nTechnically a subluxation is an incomplete dislocation; it’s the shoulder coming out, but it pops back in easily\nA dislocation is where the shoulder comes out and it needs to be put back in\n\n\nThe more dislocations (or subluxations) one has, the more stretchy and compliant the tissues become\n\nSo then it can slip and slide back in and out with regularity\n\n\n\nStability of the shoulder joint \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large

looking at the right shoulder socket and we’re looking at it en fosse (from the side, facing forward), the glenohumeral fosse \n\n\nThe front of the person is the anterior (labeled Ant. in the figure above), and the posterior (labeled Post.) is to the back\nSuperior is up above, and inferior is down below\nImportantly, around the outside (that second circle) is the outline of the labrum \n\nThat’s a rubbery calamari-like structure, really chewy like bad calamari\nIt’s very strong\nWhat is does is amazing because it effectively developed as a way to decrease the depth of the socket\nIt works like a suction cup\nAlton adds, “If you take a non arthritic cadaver specimen and dissect away all of the muscle, all the ligaments, and you stick it on the humeral head, on the labrum, it’ll sit there.”\nBut just like a thermometer held to the window with a suction cup, if you get your finger in there and break the seal, it falls away\n\nThat’s what happens here\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get a lot of static stability in our shoulder from this superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior labrum \nIn a nonpathologic state, when you have a young person (who has not experienced any shoulder trauma), is that contained space of fluid between those two cartilaginous surfaces of the glenoid fossa of the humeral head fully contained? \n\nAbsolutely, you couldn’t have suction without an aqueous, viscous fluid\n\nAnd as soon as you poke a hole in that you lose suction\n\n\nYou have a nice viscous joint fluid in all of our joints like that\n\nWhen a person has a subluxation, it doesn’t necessarily tear the labrum, does it? \n\nCorrect, and that’s another huge point that factors into Alton’s treatment recommendations and mechanisms of injury\n\nIf you are a young woman playing soccer, women in general have looser joints\nActually, because of the weird nature of the shoulders, there are men who also have super loose shoulders at baseline (they’re born that way)\n\n\n\nIn general, if you think of someone whether male or female who has super loose joints, then they can sublux out in and out without tearing anything \n\nThey just ride up over that because it’s just loosey-goosey\nThe tighter the shoulder is, the more you have to lose\n\nWhat happens to the fluid when they sublux?  \n\nNothing, the ligaments are stretchy and they’re bigger\n\n“It’s more like a balloon that you’ve kept blowing up repeatedly”\n\n\n\nShoulder dislocation in someone with a stable joint \n\nBut if you have someone who has a pretty stable joint (not loosey-goosey) and then they sublux, the only way you can do that is by tearing the ligaments, but usually you also tear/ separate the labrum (the inner arc in the figure above)  from its hard, bony cartilaginous, perfectly fused attachment\n\nThis attachment is very strong\nIt takes a massive force to dislocate the shoulder or perfect mechanics\n\n\nFor example, classically, if you’re reaching up to get a rebound and someone grabs your arm and jerks it backwards, that’s an unnatural leverage that makes the head tend to go out anteriorly inferiorly (in the bottom-left direction in the figure above)\n\nAnd that’s also a vulnerability based on where the muscles attach\n\n\nThis labrum is tough, but it tears off\n\nOn the right side of the drawing above is the classic location where you tear the labrum \nIt takes either a small tear that then is repetitively increased in size just from aggressive, but repetitive use\nOr it takes a one-time significant dislocation\n\n\n\nThe attachments of the 4 rotator cuff muscles  \n\nMuscles are drawn as ovals around the outside of the rotator cuff in the previous figure\nThese are the cross-sections of the muscles that are just outside the joint\n\nThese encompass and enshroud the joint\nThis is the cross-sectional muscle bellies\n\n\nAs you’d come further out toward the head (to the left of the drawing), they taper down and form the tendons\n\nThat’s so important because no shoulder can be stable alone just by these static stabilizers, the labrum and the ligaments \n\nThe ligaments lie in between the labrum and the rotator cuff on the right edge of the drawing\n\nWhen you’re referring to a SLAP tear, SLAP stands for superior labral anterior posterior \n\nThat is on the top side of the diagram (the superior), the green line labeled SLAP \nThat’s an odd injury\nThe first person that taught us about this was a fellow named Steve Snyder in Northern California\n\nHe was the first to categorize and identify these as clinically relevant entities\n\n\nSLAP tears are not clinically relevant for everybody\nThey are relevant for younger, very athletic people (overhead athletes, weightlifters, people doing CrossFit, people doing all manner of more aggressive sports)\nThis is different from having a tear in the right side of the previous figure\n\nYou’re active and you keep dislocating, subluxating in the direction of the arrow\n\n\nThis was Peter, he had a big anterior inferior tear\n\n \nPeter’s shoulder problems [31:30]\n\nPeter had his first subluxation in boxing when he was about 17\nHe remembers 2 injuries in high school\n\nThe 1st subluxation was boxing and just bad timing throwing a hard punch, and the guy gets out of the way and probably smacked his arm and it came out\nThe 2nd one (6 months later) was doing an absurdly heavy military press, and he remembers boom, it just popped out (and down)\n\n\nFrom then on, it was a vicious cycle of never ending subluxations with each couple of years having a really bad one\nAnother really bad one was during an open water swim race, swimming freestyle\n\nHe’s in the reach phase with his right arm in front, and the swimmer in front of him kicked down on that arm with some force (but not absurd), and the down kick of that arm took him out\n\n\nAlton notes Peter is describing so many great and different types of mechanisms that cause shoulder dislocation\n\nEspecially boxing, he’s seen a lot of these‒ the recoil where you don’t hit something your body is anticipating and it’s tightened up and ready for a contact that doesn’t happen\nIt’s no different than there’s an extra step in front of you that you don’t know about, and you step and you go, whoa, and then you feel like it shutters your whole body\nPeter probably did have a posterior subluxation\n\n\nPeter had a tear going all the way from posterior all the way around, about 240 degrees\n\nIndicated in the previous figure by the blue line\nYou don’t get that from 1 injury\n\n\nIt became looser and looser over time and because Peter is so fit, he was compensating for it very well\n\nHe was doing all the right upper body, shoulder strengthening exercises\nHe was using his dynamic stabilizers to compensate for the loss of static stabilizers\n\n\n\nDynamic stabilizers can compensate for the loss of static stabilizers but they will fatigue, leading to problems \n\nWhat happens is when you are maxing out and doing it repetitively, the dynamic stabilizers fatigue\n\nThis is one of the most common scenarios Alton sees in young swimmers (more often female)\nThey’re competing and they need the stability, especially they’re doing flying fly and backstroke\nThey acquire all this laxity in their shoulder and they’re so strong dynamically that they’re fine and it gives them that extra pull, that extra inch or two\nFatigue is a problem\n\nIf they have a weekend-long match (8 events in 3 days), they are fine the 1st 2 days, but by the 3rd day, they are fatigued and then they start subluxing\nThen they get all this secondary inflammation and pain and that’s when the damage occurs and they have to sit out\n\n\nThen we have to strengthen rehab, sometimes even tighten up the capsule when they get so loose\n\n\n\n \nThe structure of the biceps and common injuries [35:30]\n\nThe biceps tendon can be incredibly painful (tendonosis)\nPeter thinks for an average person, it’s not entirely clear where that pain is coming from if they feel pain there\nAlton notes that the biceps are a weird structure, and it’s part of that weird evolution we have\nThe biceps is 1 muscle in our arm, but it’s 2 tendons at the origin in the shoulder (see the figure below)\nIt has a single point of attachment in the forearm, crosses the joint as 1 muscle and then splits into 2 bellies with 2 attachment points\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19197\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f8-altonbarron.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"465\"

often gets inflamed\nIt can be quite painful and can affect everyday life\nThe 2nd tendon peels off and goes outside the joint (the short head in the figure above, also shown on the left most side of Alton’s previous drawing)\n\nIt attaches to a bony prominence in that weird scapula that they talked about\nIt attaches there and literally never tears\n\n\nBut people often do tear this biceps (labeled in Alton’s previous drawing)\n\nDue to wear and tear or acute trauma\nIt leads to a classic Popeye muscle where half their muscle is balled up and looks weird\nIt’s not really that much of a functional consequence\nUsually it stops hurting when it ruptures\nJohn Elway (the great quarterback from Denver) was having shoulder pain and was even thinking about retiring\n\nHis biceps tendon ruptured, the pain went away, and then he won another 2 superbowls after that\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a structure that’s not necessary and there’s a lot of argument in orthopedics about how important it really is\nIt is anchored up at the superior labrum\nWhen you tear that superior labrum, that biceps does funky things\n\nIt becomes unstable and it gets more inflamed often\nThen you get all that secondary pain\n\n\nSome people (not Alton) who fix a lot of these will automatically just snip that biceps and reattach it in the front so it’s no longer a pain generator (tenodesis procedure)\nAlton only performs a tenodesis when he sees tearing, splitting, something structurally wrong with the biceps\n\nHe knows he can get a good repair of the superior labrum, and once that’s stable, the biceps is fine again (it’s no longer symptomatic)\n\n\n\n \nLabrum tears in the shoulder and natural loss of cartilage with usage and time [38:15]\n\nPeter makes a comparison, “The torn labrum is to the shoulder what the disc herniation is to the back”\nYou could take a MRI of a person who has no spine issues and see many asymptomatic herniations, which mean nothing\nHe suspects a labral tear in the shoulder is the same\n\nAlton agrees, and this is such a point of frustration\nRadiologists do their job in reading abnormalities\nThe problems is that most of us by middle age will have plenty of positive findings, but they’re asymptomatic \n\n\n\n“It’s a very double-edged sword to get those MRIs.  Same thing in the labrum.”‒ Alton Barron\n\nThe labrum will naturally degenerate just by using it, so will the cartilage\nWe know there’s a genetic predisposition to arthritis\nBy arthritis, Alton means not just inflammation of the joint, but a true loss of the cartilage integrity\n\nThose two terms are used interchangeably by different people in different subspecialty\nBut for an orthopedic surgeon, it’s when the joint is degenerating and the cartilage surfaces are no longer pristine (just like you’re chipping the paint on your car)\n\n\n\nDoes loss of cartilage integrity occur preferentially on the humeral head or in the glenoid fossa?  Or is it one of those things where the second you get one chip, it starts happening on both sides? \n\nWe don’t have a good natural history of that\nAlton has done total shoulders on people who had no cartilage left on their humeral head\n\nIt was perfectly round and smooth bone, there was no cartilage left\nWhereas the glenoid still had cartilage on it\nThat’s a case where the loss on the humerus was smooth enough and gradual enough to where it didn’t dig in and eat away at the socket\nBut it doesn’t matter, you still have to replace the socket\n\n\nFor younger athletic people, who have a humeral head that’s been damaged and they have a big chunk, maybe a quarter size (maybe a 50 cent piece size) of full cartilage loss, that’s not great\n\nThat just keeps sloughing off cartilage and keeps getting inflamed\nThey’re on the young side so you don’t want to do a shoulder replacement on them\nInstead, they will do a humeral head resurfacing (a nice, new, smooth metal head), but they leave the glenoid intact and they have good cartilage there \n\nSo, it’s metal on natural cartilage\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of metal is used? \n\nCobalt-chromium alloys\n\nJust like the hips\n\n\nThe nice thing about those is, if you can get 5 years, they can be much more aggressive with their activities\n\nAton has some people who get 10 years and are fine\n\n\nIf it does wear down the glenoid side, then you just go back in and revise it and put a plastic cup for the glenoid\n\n \nShoulder evaluation with MRI vs. physical exam, diagnosing pain, and when to have surgery [41:30]\nThe contrast between MRI findings and the physical exam \n\nPeter remembers the first time he saw Alton (about a year before his surgery), he knew his labrum had been torn to shreds for years but didn’t want to have surgery unless he really needed to\n\nIn that first exam, Alton agreed, he wasn’t ready for surgery yet\n\n\n\nHow do you test the surrounding structures to elicit feedback on the labrum? \n\nAlton is glad Peter asked, “Because one should never make their clinical, especially surgical decision-making on just an MRI”\nAlton has written a couple of book chapters on this, including complete examination of the shoulder with provocative maneuvers and so forth\nIt’s important to get a good history of the mechanics of the injury\n\nWhether it was from shooting a bow and arrow, playing basketball, lifting weights, etc\n\n\n\nYou need to know a combination of the mechanism of injury, the symptoms, and the physical exam,  and if you do those compulsively and well, you will be 95% accurate without any MRI \nWhen to have surgery \n\nPeter remembers one of the things that changed before his surgery\n\nHe couldn’t serve a volleyball with his daughter\nHe couldn’t shout one basket\nBut he could pull a 95-lb bow back and take 100 shots\nThis didn’t make sense to him\n\n\nIt all comes down to the mechanics of each individual and this is where the MRI does come in\nAlton uses MRIs more to corroborate things that can be there\n\nThe difference between a partial thickness rotator cuff tear and a full thickness or a full thickness small and a full thickness large\n\nThose are variable based again on the patient’s activity\n\n\n\n\nAlton adds, “We know from good studies done with ultrasound MRI that walking down the street, half the people age 60 have rotator cuff tears”\n\nThey’re asymptomatic\nIt may not be a big tear, but it can be\n\n\n\nIt’s so important that we don’t ignore something that can get much worse and make treatment or recovery much more difficult.  But at the same time, we need to be more circumspect about who we’re operating and who we’re not operating on.  \nAre there indications where we operate on asymptomatic things in the shoulder? \n\nIn general, no\nUnless you have a tumor\nAlton was swimming with his dad about 6 months before he passed away (at age 95)\n\nHis dad was really vigorous, mentally and physically fit\nHe ended up having pancreatic cancer that killed him at 95\nHe had a great life, no complaints\nAt 86, he was a guy who could still do pull-ups, who was swimming in the lake\n\nPeter adds, “This guy is my hero”\n\n\nHe did all his own yard work, everything\nHe never took medication\nHe was running to get out of the way of the sprinkler, did a banana peel, and had a dislocation of his shoulder, ripped off two and a half of his four tendons\n\nRemember, one of them never tears, so he tore almost his complete functional rotator cuff\n\n\nAlton did a little FaceTime with his dad and noticed he couldn’t lift his arm\nHe urged his dad to visit and get an MRI\nAlton and his partner fixed him \nThey didn’t give him much sedation, just regional anesthesia, and he got a good 6 anchor repair\nAt age 94, you couldn’t tell he ever had a tear\n\nHe healed and went back to doing everything\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would have been the natural history for Alton’s dad if he didn’t have this surgery? \n\nA lot of doctors might have left him alone, and then he would have been miserable for the next 9 years of his life\n\nBecause he couldn’t lift his arm\nIt might not have been that painful, but he wouldn’t have been able to do everything he wanted\n\n\n\nPain shouldn’t be the only symptom we look for‒ we have to look for function \n\nIf someone came in with a traumatic motor vehicle accident where they tore their rotator cuff badly at age 60, 65\nAlton would tell them it’s not necessary to have them repaired\nBut if you don’t repair it, those muscles that lost their muscle-tendon connection are going to atrophy \nIt may not be painful, but if you want to do things you were doing before the accident, they need to be repaired\nThe 2nd caveat is you may start having symptoms in 6 months even doing those other things\n\nIf you do, don’t ignore it, go back to the orthopedist \n\n\nIt’s a dynamic state over a long period of time; so you need to be flexible\n\nIf you start having symptoms when you’ve been asymptomatic, something has changed (anatomically, physiologically or something), and it’s time to reassess  \nWhen a person comes in with shoulder pain, what is on your differential diagnosis in the exam (before the MRI)? \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19198\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f9-altonbarron-1024x559.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\"

and Wikipedia\n\nAlton drew the shoulder again and added the clavicle (collarbone) and the acromion (the bony roof of the shoulder, another part of the weird scapula), see the figure above\nWhen you hear about someone separating their shoulder, this is the acromioclavicular joint (AC joint)\n\nCircled in red at the top of the drawing above\nIt only rotates about 20 degrees\n\n\nThe collarbone is a stabilizer bar\n\nFor car lovers, it’s effectively a MacPherson strut on a car \n\n\nSome people are born without collarbones and they can bring their shoulders completely together in the center\nIn cyclists, collarbones are the most commonly injured because they land on the outside of their shoulder\nThe AC joint is what happens when people separate their shoulder (also super common)\n\nIt’s different from a dislocation\nIt’s usually from a force coming down from the top\nSo we’re pitched forward, we land on the point of our shoulder and it jams it down (we can talk about that later)\n\n\n\n \nHow anatomical variation can predispose one to injury and how screening may help [50:30]\n\nThe acromion is that bony roof, and under that roof is where the rotator cuff glides\nAs the head rotates back and forth around, the rotator cuff is attached here and it goes back and forth here, and it’s rubbing or moving underneath this\n\nSee the arrows back and forth in the previous diagram \n\n\nAny place in our body that there’s two structures, anatomically in the limbs that move differentially with one another, there’s usually a bursa that forms in between\n\nSo, that bursa is drawn in green (in the previous figure)\nThat bursa is just a thin filmy structure that can thicken up and become very inflamed and become bursitis (very painful)\n\nThat’s a common, common diagnosis\n\n\nOtherwise, the purpose of the bursa is to allow these things to glide past each other frictionless \n\n\nThen some of us are born with an extra kind of downsloping of that acromion (shown in the figure below), or a bone spur, or we acquire it from repetitive athletic use (there are multiple reasons)\n\nAlso indicated in Alton’s drawing by the red shaded area at the top left, on top of the bursa (which is green)\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19199\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f10-altonbarron-1024x577.png\"

bursa\nYou can imagine if this is running back and forth, it’s irritating the bursa, creating bursitis\nAnd it’s also frictionally rubbing against the rotator cuff tendon\nYou can get bursal-sided upper part rotator cuff tears from that alone\n\nAlton knows because he had a big spur like that in his shoulder\n\n\n\nFor Alton, the spur occurred because he was genetically predisposed to it based on the shape of his bursa \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19200\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f11-altonbarron-905x1024.png\" alt=\"\"

blue).  Sketched by Alton Barron\n\nYou can have a type I, a type II, or a type III acromion (drawn in blue, at the top of the figure above)\n\nType I is totally flat (this is the majority of people)\nType II is the second most common\nType III predisposes you to this problem (about 30% of people have this type)\n\nYou’re only at risk of you are an overhead athlete, lift weights overhead or do aggressive things\nIf you’re sedentary and never exercise, you’ll never have a problem because you’re not repetitively loading it enough to wear it down or cause a tear\n\n\n\n\nPeter relates that people often say “Well, I can do so and so and I’ve never had an issue. Therefore, it’s okay.”  \n\nIf you have the type I acromion, you can probably get away with a lot more overhead activity\nBut for somebody who’s in category III, every time they do excessive overhead activity they might get injured\n\n\nPeter thinks it would be interesting if we knew these things in advance and we could maybe modify and temper our activity around our genetics effectively\nAlton agrees, the anatomic/ mechanical predisposition to injury is interesting \n\nPeter’s personal example of anatomical predisposition \n\nPeter had an MRI for other reasons and discovered he has a narrow C-spine (there’s no wiggle room)\nAs a result, he takes” tech neck protocol” very seriously\nHe know he already has 2 small herniations\n\nLuckily, they aren’t doing anything to him\nBut nobody’s going to go in and remove one without doing the other, which means they’d fuse him out of the gate\n\n\nKnowing this is helpful\n\nIt tells him to do a lot of rehabilitative exercises even before having an injury\n\n\nHe thinks he’s fortunate he’s no longer a surgeon, because a lot of his surgery colleagues ended up having neck surgery (resulting from working in a certain position all the time)\nPeter never thought about this from a joint context\nAlton adds, “If you have a congenitally narrow stenotic spine and you’re playing football, you’re way more at risk for catastrophic spinal cord injury”\n\nScreening for anatomical predispositions to injury  \n\nAlton was team doctor for almost 15 years a college up in New York\n\nBut if you have your first stinger, then you need to be screened, and see if you are at high risk\nIf you are, then you have a very serious discussion about what you’re subjecting your neck to\n\nThere are a lot of sports to play, and you don’t necessarily have to be butting heads at high velocity\n\n\n\n\nBut it hasn’t been done in the shoulder\n\nIt’d be a simple, easy screen \n\n\nThis could be important for kids who have a lot of athletic potential, and at age 11 are going to decide what to focus on\n\nIf you knew you’d have a longer shelf life in one sport over another, that should weigh into the decision-making process\n\n\nFor instance, if you have super loose joints, then you’re going to need to pick the ones that you can keep dynamically stabilized but are not going to be subjected directly to unnecessary forces\n\n \nPain generators in

the drawing above\n\n\nThe AC joint is another one\n\nCircled in red in the drawing above\n\n\n\n“Almost everybody through wear and tear, middle age and beyond, has arthritis in the AC joint… it’s almost always asymptomatic, but it can be symptomatic”‒ Alton Barron\nThe little red structure you’ve drawn, that ligament that is connecting the clavicle to the acromion, is there fluid within that space? \n\nThere’s a tiny amount of fluid, but very little\nAny place there’s cartilage, there’s a tiny amount of fluid\nBut it can expand, and if it’s arthritic, you can get more fluid\nYoung weightlifters can develop fluid in the end of the clavicle from repetitive use\n\nThis end of the clavicle is shaded in red in the previous drawing\nDoing heavy bench press and other activities can result in distal clavicle osteolysis\nRepetitive jamming or bruising of the bone and cartilage causes the cartilage to disintegrate and the bone to lose its integrity \n\nIt starts to get very soft and it gets very inflamed\n\n\nAs soon as you start breaking up cartilage, all the macrophages from the body come in there and then you get a big inflammatory response\n\nYou get a lot of extra fluid and a lot of pain\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a chronic perspective, does this occur more in somebody doing bench press or military press or which direction? \n\nYes (in both) and also with heavy lat raises \nLat raises puts so much leverage on that joint, it just jams up\n\nAlton does not recommend his patients do these\nIf you are to do it and want to minimize stress, Peter is in favor of thumbs going up (not down), and not directly laterally but more in the natural plane of the scapula \n\n\n\nMore about the biomechanics of this joint \n\nIf you lie directly on the point of your shoulder and it jams that again, and causes a lot of pain there\nThat pain comes right down the front and kind of follows the biceps\nSo, you have to differentiate that between the 2\nThen you look at an X-ray (without an MRI), and you see these spurs that are down there\n\nThe area of the previous drawing circled in red, near the AC joint\nWell, those spurs aren’t ever going to tear the rotator cuff, because that tendon is out there (to the left)‒ it never gets that far\nBut it rubs, and we see it as an indentation in the muscle\nEvery time you’re working out, you hypertrophy your muscles, so if you have that constantly rubbing there and then you hypertrophy around it, it hurts\n\nPeter notes, “That’s an athlete who complains that when they’re lifting, it hurts more”\nYet when they’re relaxed and haven’t been exercising, they have rock solid strength\nBut if you get them up into positions, or if they’ve been working out and you test them, they’ll be weak (their brain stops them to prevent pain)\n\n\n\n\n\n The nuance of the shoulder exam\n\nThis reminds Peter of a book he read once he decided he was going into surgery, Cope’s Early Diagnosis of the Acute Abdomen  \n\nThe entire book was based on diagnosing appendicitis\nPeter thought it was the most fascinating thing in the world, because you had this old school general surgeon who said, “This is 100% a clinical diagnosis”\n\nThis was before anyone was using a CT\n\n\nAn appendicitis is the single most prevalent condition in general surgery\nNobody training today would ever dream you could waste an entire book to diagnose something where you could just shove somebody in the scanner and get the answer\n\n\nThis exam makes Peter thinks of Coope’s Appendicitis because things are more complicated\nPeter doesn’t think there will ever be a substitute for the nuance of the exam and the history of the injury and of what causes pain\nFor Alton, the guy who was his Cope was his Professor of Cardiology at Tulane, C. Thorpe Ray\n\nHe was in his 80s at the time\n\nHe had thyroid cancer and spoke in a very hushed tone\n\n\nHe could tell you exactly what was wrong with which heart valve just by listening to you with a stethoscope, with his hands, sometimes he just put his ear up there\n\nHe could tell by the nature of the subtle variations in the heart murmurs what the diagnosis was\n\n\n\n\n\n“I do lament the fact that that’s a dying art”‒ Peter Attia\n\nPeter acknowledges, the reality of it is that today with echo and stuff we’re better\nHe was probably such an outlier that most people could never reach that level\n\nJust like most people could have never attained the clinical acumen of Cope\n\n\nIt would be great to have both\nPeter adds, “It’s interesting to think that in orthopedics it might be one of those specialties where this judgment of the exam is still really, really relevant” \nAlton agrees and adds, you get pinpoint diagnoses with the various tests\nThere are plenty of things you find with tests that aren’t symptomatic\nAlton points out, “But our patients need us to be able to still diagnose, listen to them, hear what they’re saying” \n\nYou want to hear the patient’s story and know what’s really going on to determine whether they need surgical or non-surgical care or what kind of care they need\n\n\nPeter felt like this was a very important message in residency, “The single most important thing that you will learn is when to operate and when not to operate”\nWhen you start residency, you’re just so preoccupied with mastering the technical side of things (there’s so much to learn)\n\nIt’s like learning to master an instrument and learn a new language at the same time, and you’ve only got 5 years to do it\n\n\nAlton agrees, but unfortunately there are plenty of people who will operate on any MRI\nPeter adds, “We had one surgeon who the joke was, if you rubbed Betadine on the wall, he would operate on the wall. Don’t let Betadine near the wall, because he’ll start cutting it.”\nAlton agrees, there are economic incentives\nHe has to suppress that information because it makes him too cynical and sad, but it happens\nHe sees patients that walk in with their MRI all the time and say, “I’m scheduled for this surgery in my shoulder or my elbow. My friend said I should just come get one more opinion.”\n\nAlton does the exam and does not find a need to operate\nHe tells them, “Look, I wasn’t there at the time of your examination, so I can’t speak for what that person saw and what their statement is. But today, based on your MRI, your history and your physical exam, I will not operate on you… Maybe someday, but not now.”\n\nSometimes this is confusing for patients\n\n\n\n\nPeter notes, “The thing you always have to remember as a patient, and I think of this myself, is once you commit to doing something, the inertia to do it is huge”\n\nThere is an asymmetry in this decision‒ to not have surgery doesn’t remove any options\n\nYou can have surgery later if it is the right thing to do\nOnce you have surgery, the operative field never looks the same the second time\nSo, you want to keep in mind the asymmetry of a pause\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFrozen shoulder [1:05:15]\nShoulder pain can have many causes \n\nThe AC joint can be the problem\nBursitis\nA rotator cuff injury\nA labral injury\nBicep tendon inflammation\nArthritis\nAdhesive capsulitis (discussed next)\nNeck pain from the spine (discussed later)\n\nFrozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19202\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f13-altonbarron-1024x898.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f13-altonbarron-1024x898.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f13-altonbarron-300x263.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f13-altonbarron-768x673.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f13-altonbarron.png 1250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 13. The capsule in the shoulder joint.  Sketched by Alton Barron\n\nThe best place to see the capsule is with a MRI because it’s thicker there and more distinct (there’s not other structures obscuring it)\nNormally, if you have a super loose joint, you can have a very capacious capsule like that, that allows it to flop down and even sublux or dislocate\nWhen it’s very high and tight and thick there, that can be representative of something called adhesive capsulitis\n\nThis is very common, and it can conflate all sorts of diagnoses\n\nHe sees 2-3 new cases every week\n\n\nThe frozen shoulder is the layman term for adhesive capsulitis\n\n\nWe don’t know why this happens but it’s multifactorial\n\nLike many things, it’s worse if you have diabetes\n\nBut you don’t get it with more frequency if you have diabetes\n\n\nThere’s a lot of misinformation about it because the old literature says it will get better with time (not true)\nOnly about 1 out of 5 of Alton’s patients actually ever need surgery, and he never does this at the beginning\n\nSurgery would be a simple, 30-minute release of the capsule and reduction of the inflammation\n\n\n80% do not need surgery, they need some way to control the inflammation along with really good physical therapy and a home program\n\nTo restore mobility\n\n\n\n\nYou can get a stiff shoulder if you have impingement\n\nIf you have a big bone spur and your brain says “I’m not going to let you move it there”, then it just gradually stiffens up\n\nThat’s a secondary stiffness or adhesive capsulitis\n\n\nIt’s not the weird primary adhesive capsulitis that could happen to you or me just suddenly\n\nIt’s a spontaneous intense inflammation in the inner lining\nIf you take a little camera and stick it in there and just look, you see it’s beet red\nNormally in an arthroscopy, everything’s kind of off white\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes a frozen shoulder respond to NSAIDs or is this a part of the body that doesn’t have enough of a vascular supply in the capsule that you don’t get enough penetration? \n\nIt has a rich vascular supply\nAlton gives NSAIDs when people want them and are afraid of an injection\nBut he thinks NSAIDs aren’t strong enough\n\nThat inner lining is so robust\nHe likes to put a small dose of cortisone into the joint 1 time\n\n\nHe always injects cortisone from the back for 2 reasons\n\n1 – This part is more richly supplied by the brachial plexus, so it’s more sensitive\n2 – People kind of see you coming at them with a needle\nHe never uses an ultrasound, you can feel where you’re going\n\n\nHe puts local anesthetic in there as well\n\nPeople come in with a lot of stiffness and pain, and they walk out saying “Oh my gosh, it’s amazing”\nSo for these patients  they’re free in 10 seconds\n\n\nThey probably still need physical therapy, but they feel dramatic relief from such a simple treatment\n\nDo you recommend that a patient with frozen shoulder err on the side of earlier intervention with a cortisone shot to then allow them to do more rehab sooner? Or do you want them to do 3 months of rehab first? \n\nIt depends on their exam, their history and how long they’ve had it, and how acutely symptomatic it is\nWhen examining them, if Alton can stretch them and they say it hurts a little at the end, but they have decent motion\n\nThey are simply tight and need PT to really stretch them out\nThey don’t need anything else, not even NSAIDs\n\n\nBut if he can’t get them to move and they’re screaming, they’re not going to get anywhere in PT (because it will hurt too much to do it)\n\nSo he’ll inject them and send them to PT\n\n\nHe always sees them back in about 6 weeks\nMuch of them are dramatically better, but not all of them\nVery rarely they need a second shot\nThen some of them are just recalcitrant and they just stay stiff, and then Alton will do the little surgical procedure on them\n\n \nShoulder pain that originates in the neck [1:11:15]\n\nA big source of shoulder pain is referred pain from the neck\n\nAlton includes this in his shoulder exam\n\n\nAlton takes care of a lot of professional musicians; their necks are doing all sorts of crazy things (think of a violinist)\nAll types of musical instruments lead to having to maintain these certain postures that sometimes are very counterproductive to one’s overall musculoskeletal health\nPeople will come in with shoulder pain going down their arm, maybe even down to their hand\n\nThey’ve already gotten a shoulder MRI\nThey’re 55, and they have 4 findings on their MRI, but the pain is not coming from their shoulder, it’s coming from their neck \nAlton has to make sure and differentiate that, because the worst thing he could do to them is have them take time off from music to fix what doesn’t need to be fixed in their shoulder and then have them return\n\n\n\nWhat in the exam makes you think to look at the neck first with the MRI? \nFor intrinsic shoulder pathology, almost never does the pain radiate down below the elbow \n\nWhether it’s a rotator cuff, whether it’s impingement, or whether it’s arthritis\n\nWhereas neck origin almost always goes down below the elbow and into the hand \n\nWhether it’s a pinched nerves at any the lower cervical spine (where it’s more common to have pathology)\n\n\nOne odd ball is C7\nAlton learned this not that long ago from some really great cervical spine surgeons‒ if you have a deep posterior pain under your scapula, that can be C7 \n\nHe’s had two musicians recently, both with that diagnosis\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19203\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f14-altonbarron-1024x531.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f14-altonbarron-1024x531.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f14-altonbarron-300x155.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f14-altonbarron-768x398.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f14-altonbarron.png 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 14.

it produced a complete tightening of the capsule\nThere’s a school of thought in orthopedics that says, “We just don’t like repairing labrums and doing capsule repairs in older people because that’s the outcome you get,” and that’s valid\n\nHow does age factor into the decision to operate? \n\nSome people thought Peter was crazy to have a labral repair at age 50\n\nBut he hasn’t lost any mobility, which is remarkable\n\n\nIn Peter’s case, Alton doesn’t think there was a choice because of his subluxation with all the different activities\n\nHe already had some arthritis\nHe was wearing down some cartilage\nIt was this surgery or the inevitability of having a shoulder replacement in another 10 years\n\n\nFor Peter, knowing what he knows now (that there is a little arthritis there), he wishes he had had surgery sooner\nHe had a ton of pain 10-15 years ago, but got out of it with a lot of good tissue work and training\n\nHe made some modifications and decided there were certain things he couldn’t do\n\n\nAlton notes that people now are so much younger physiologically (in better condition)\nWe know that a 50-year-old now cannot be compared to data of 50-year-olds 20 years ago\n\nSo Peter is not a typical 50-year-old from the literature\n\n\n\nAlton based his decision on biological age, not chronological age \n\nThere are some people he scopes because there’s no other way than looking to see what’s there\n\nSometimes they have better cartilage than what the MRI is indicating and he can go ahead and do a repair\nHe’s done a couple of 58-year-olds, 60-year-olds, but their joint was pristine, it looked as good as a 25-year-old\n\nThey just had a discrete labral tear\n\n\n\n\nFor Peter this is an extension of what he thinks of as precision medicine \n\nWe use evidence-based medicine (which is incredibly heterogeneous) to make population-based assertions and general broad recommendations\nBut ultimately, the only patient that really matters for most doctors is the one right in front of them\nTherefore, you have to be able to make evidence-informed decisions based on the appropriate physiology that you see\n\n\nAlton agrees and adds it’s a conversation with the patient and not a unilateral decision\n\nPhysicians need to say, “Here are the possibilities, and what do you want to do?”\n\n\n\nScope imaging\n\nThe biggest ports are for the camera, and there are a few working ports in the front and back\nPathology is superior and anterior\nYou’re working in the superior in the front and go in through the back with a camera (to get a good panoramic view of everything)\nThey have 2 different kinds of angled lenses, so they can see around corners if needed\nHe can see the superior labrum; he can see the biceps\n\nDo you insufflate with carbon dioxide? \n\nYes, you’re shooting carbon dioxide to blow everything up\nAnd he uses water to do the same thing, but not at high pressure (35 mmHg)\n\nIt makes the capsule bigger\nLower pressure means less postoperative pain and less distention\n\n\nYou can still put in little retractors, kind of pull tissue out of the way and so forth\nSo that’s just a technique that’s more of an extension of what Alton does in the elbow\n\nBecause there’s a lot more peril because of the nerves being so close\n\n\nUsually you need 2 working portals in the front\n\nWhich are just basically canals to get in with instruments, that are long enough to fit through and do the work\n\n\nIn the case of a superior labrum, we use a percutaneous hole right through the top, just underneath… right under where that red arrow is going (highlighted in yellow in the figure below)\n\nAnd that just gets you to the superior labrum\nSo that’s a little percutaneous, a tiny little hole in the rotator cuff muscle-tendon junction\nIt just spreads the fibers apart, so it doesn’t do any damage to that\nAnd then you’ve got a perfect bird’s eye direction for the drilling and putting in a few anchors in the top\nAnd then that’s really it\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19204\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f15-altonbarron-1024x884.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"884\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f15-altonbarron-1024x884.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f15-altonbarron-300x259.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f15-altonbarron-768x663.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f15-altonbarron.png 1026w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 15. Front view of shoulder anatomy with highlighted arrows indicating direction of holes made during surgery.  Sketched by Alton Barron\nExplain how the surgical repair works \n\nYou drill a little hole in the glenoid fossa\n\nThe diameter depends on what kind of anchor you are doing\nUsually not more than 3 mm, and now we’re down to 1.8 mm\n3 mm seems big, but that’s what you fit the plastic or the absorbable anchor in that you tap in with the mallet\n\n\nYou’re drilling into the bone, and you have to get the angle right\n\nIndicated with arrows pointed right (see the small red arrows highlighted in blue in the figure above)\nAnd then the anchor inserts through that\nThey’re not circumferential, they’re straight in\n\nIf we did them open as we used to, we’d drill holes and use a suture going through circumferentially\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat holds the anchor in? \nIs it the pressure of putting in an anchor that is bigger than the hole? \n\nYes\nHistorically there were some that we screw in, but not anymore\nNow they are purely basically braided polyester\n\nThe suture goes in, and then as you carefully pull it back out, the way they’re designed, they ball up \nIt’s super strong; you can lift the shoulder off the table\nAlton knows if he tugs on it multiple times, it’s not going to come out\n\nIt would take fully traumatic force to dislodge it\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you examine the cuff while you’re in there? \n\nAbsolutely, he goes through and does a survey of the joint\nHe looks at the cartilage surfaces, all the nooks and crannies\nHe looks at the rotator cuff inserting on the bone, from inside out\n\nAnd you can see if it’s smooth, if it’s frayed\nIf it’s notably frayed, you can probe it\nOccasionally he may see a small, almost full-thickness tear (because they’re athletes)\n\nThen I might put a stitch or two in that to fix that\n\n\nYou look at the biceps\n\nYou can pull the biceps into the joint and see a pretty good segment of it and see if it’s inflamed, torn, something abnormal there\n\n\nYou can see the tendon of the biceps really well too, and if it’s frayed\n\n\n\nHow much damage do you need to see to do the tenodesis? \n\nNot a lot\nIf he sees a combination of a modest amount of fraying and a lot of inflammation around it\nAnd when he pulls it in the joint, that extends further out, then he’ll tenodese it\n\nIt’s important to understand how much your eyes are helpful here \n\nWhen you look at Peter’s intra-op images, it is very plain, banal sort of gray-white (normal)\n\n *See photos as an addendum at the end of the show notes* \n\n\nInflammation shows up as really red\nAlton likes to get a little electrocautery wand, and he paints the internal and gets rid of all that pink because it’s inflammatory  \n\nIt hurts, and that’s part of one of the big pain generators\n\n\nNow, theoretically, if you fix everything, that’s going to go away anyway\n\nBut it helps patients early post-op\n\n\nA recent patient that Alton did a pretty significant repair on, after 5 days, he said, “I haven’t had any pain. What’s going on? Did you do anything to my shoulder?”\n\nAlton repaired it, but he thinks part of it is just getting rid of that inflammation and so forth\n\n\n\n \nRepairing the rotator cuff [1:29:15]\nWhat is the most common athlete’s tear to the rotator cuff? \n\nIt depends on if they’re an overhead athlete\n\nIn that case, the supraspinatus is usually torn\nSometimes it can be the infraspinatus\n\n\n\nIf a guy has a straight-up supraspinatus tear, do you even need to enter the capsule necessarily, depending on how close it is? \n\nYou do, you need to make sure that you’re not missing anything, which is common in the athletes\nThere are a couple of interesting variations\n\n\nAlton drew 3 sequential axillary views, which are a bird’s eye view looking straight down on the top of your shoulder proper (see the figure below)\n\nWe’re sitting on top looking straight down\nWe’ve got the glenoid, the socket here, toward the head\nAnd we’ve got the ball out here toward the outside, where the deltoid lives\n\nThese muscles are shown in the second figure below\n\n\nThis is the supraspinatus I’ve drawn in here on the top\nIn the back, as we talked about before, that’s the infraspinatus\nAnd then in the front is the subscapularis\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19205\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f16-altonbarron-624x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f16-altonbarron-624x1024.png 624w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f16-altonbarron-183x300.png 183w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f16-altonbarron-768x1260.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f16-altonbarron.png 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" />\nFigure 16.

rotator cuff) is not really a relevant player in the pathology because it almost never tears\nPeter likes Alton’s birds-eye view of the shoulder as it allows you to see how the subscapularis and the infraspinatus are stabilizing the front and the back, while the supraspinatus is coming in over the top\n\nWe usually look at them from front and back\n\n\n\nIs the supraspinatus that wide, relatively speaking? \n\nIn anatomic diagrams it looks like a tiny little muscle, because you’re looking at it from the front\n\n\nBut it’s broad and has three-dimensionality, and it has roughly 3.0-3.5 centimeters of width going front to back\n\nBack to the 3 bird’s eye views of the shoulder in Alton’s drawing (above) \n\n#2 – The most common one is the middle one because that’s anterior\n\n The biceps is indicated with 3 blue arrows\nThat’s an anterior-superior tear\nThat’s the one that the overhead athletes get a lot (non-throwing athletes)‒ tennis players, volleyball players, and weightlifters\n“And that is one of the critical zones where it can get wrung out and not have good blood supply, and that’s where they tear” \nThe arrows indicate where they tear, that’s where Alton had little tears on both shoulders\nThat’s also the one that can be caused by a spur pushing down on it\n\n\nAlton drew a little arc in red on #2 because they’ll tear off, and then they’ll form a little arc of smooth tissue\n\nYou repair it, you freshen up the bone, and then put the sutures in that leading edge of the tendon and put it back just like you’d put a tarp with a tent stake back in\n\nYou get it back to the good bony bed, and you get that good biologic healing\n\n\nHe’s drawn a small tear in red, but they can be bigger and more chronic\n\n\n#3 – The one down below shows the subscapularis in the front \n\nThat is the one that can tear in young people or older people based on mechanism\nIf you have a linebacker who is going forward at full velocity, and then somebody is knocked into him and shoots him across\n\nHe’s got his arms out there ready to go, and he gets eccentrically loaded into external rotation \nThat’s how you can tear the subscapularis\n\n\nThe other way is people falling downstairs and grabbing the banister and wrenching back \nIt’s commonly torn with eccentric load \n\n\n#1 –  This upper one occurs in throwing athletes\n\nBaseball players and football players externally rotate dramatically, and that’s how they get their extra angular velocity to really get that zip on the ball\nSo they acquire external rotation starting at a young age, and their arms/ shoulders are very asymmetric\n\nOne side will externally rotate to 90 while the other one will go back another 45 degrees, and that’s how they get that whip\n\n\nOne of the consequences of that (in a subset of them) is that as this rotates and follows this area around (indicated by the red arrow in #1), that area of the rotator cuff (circled in black on the left) which is at the junction of the infraspinatus and the supraspinatus abuts up against the hard bony rim of the glenoid, and they get an internal impingement\nUltimately they get small partial-thickness or even full-thickness tears there\nWe have to be super cautious with those\n\nWe have to repair those, but you have to be really careful because if they lose 10 or 15 degrees of external rotation, they lose\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere does the Tommy John surgery fit into this? \n\nThat’s the elbow\nIt fits in because a lot of people add torque on their elbow because they have shoulder pathology\n\nIf they have a little weakness or something going on in their shoulder, they will overthrow with their forearm and their flexor-pronator mass\nThey’ll overthrow with the torque, and then they’ll tear their medial collateral ligament of their elbow\nAnd vice versa, if they have a partially torn medial collateral ligament that hasn’t yet been identified, they can overthrow with their shoulder to compensate, to get more angular velocity on that, because they can’t muster it through the elbow\n\n\n\nHow many years ago would it have been the case that a torn rotator cuff was the end of a pitcher’s career or a quarterback’s career at the professional level? \n\nProbably 15\nBut not today\nPeter can’t think of anything that could be more stressful, “throwing a baseball seems even more stressful than throwing a football because you do it more times in a game” and Alton agrees\n\nWhat has changed is earlier diagnosis \n\nNow at the Division 1 collegiate level, any pain is almost over-evaluated\n\nThis uses a lot of resources but can be good for the players because it identifies these things very early\n\n\n\nDo they repair very small tears before they become a bigger tear? \n\nIt depends\nYou’d certainly watch it carefully\nSometimes it’s not the tear that causes symptoms\n\nIt could be just some inflammation related to it and if you can cool that down, the tear is not biomechanically significant yet\n\n\n\nAlton has had patients with full-thickness tears that are minimally symptomatic and others with partial-thickness tears that are very symptomatic \n\nSo it depends on what you have\n\nBack to Alton’s drawing of muscles in the shoulder, explain a full-thickness tear \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19207\"

the subscapularis, in the infraspinatus, is just how long they are”\n\nWe are looking at the top, but these muscles cover the scapula\n\n\n\n\nBack to an earlier picture Alton drew of the supraspinatus tendon, that perpendicular distance through there is the full thickness \n\nIt varies depending on the size of the patient\n\n\n\nCould it be a tear across the entire 4 cm by 0.5 cm? \n\nWhen we speak typically about full thickness, we mean the depth of it this way (going up and down), so that you can have a partial-thickness tear that’s maybe half the tendon there, or full thickness\nNow, if you have half the tendon torn, you’ve lost enough biomechanics that if you’re a high-level throwing athlete, no way can this be ignored\n\nWhereas a partial-thickness tear off the tendon could easily be ignored\n\n\nThose muscle bellies are huge\nIn football players and guys who are so strong, sometimes they have that wrenching injury, and they don’t rip the tendon off the bone, but they interstitially tear at the musculotendinous junction\n\nAnd they have a tremendous amount of edema, weakness, pain, but that will heal without any intervention\n\nWith just some some anti-inflammatory and just time to heal\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAre platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections or stem cells beneficial for healing tears? [1:38:15]\nWhat role do stem cells or PRP play in any of this? \n\nPeter doesn’t think stem cells are going to replace a labrum, but if you have a tear in the muscle, they can be valuable\n\nAre people running randomized clinical trials on stem cells in that indication? \n\nAlton thinks so, but he doesn’t know that literature \nThere are a lot of terribly designed studies all around that are being used to justify using stem cells or PRP\n\nSo one has to be careful to extrapolate it to your individual practice\n\n\nThere’s a lot of money involved too\n\nAlton has patients that routinely fly to various places (including Germany) and pay a lot of money to get stem cells injected for things we’ve been talking about\n\n\nAnd there’s no data on there\nThere are a few anecdotal reports where people say there was a tear on the MRI, they injected PRP and it’s healed, gone\n\nAlton doesn’t know what to make of those\nThey’re just one-offs\nWe also don’t know what the natural history of that injury would have been without the PRP\n\n\nOne of the best scientific things Alton can relate goes down to the elbow\n\nHe was speaking just before COVID at the American Association of Sports Medicine to non-surgical, general medicine doctors who do sports medicine\n2 papers (listed in the selected links section) were presented before his talk, back-to-back on over a thousand patients\n\nDouble-blind, randomized studies on tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis), comparing cortisone, PRP, and placebo\n The placebo and the PRP were the same, while the cortisone was much more effective\n\n\nThese were back-to-back studies at different institutions\n\n\nThe literature is replete with studies that say PRP really helps\nAlton sees patients all the time that have had PRP injections\n\nAlton has a PRP machine in his office in Manhattan, and based on his current knowledge of the literature for rotator cuff repairs, for tendon ruptures, for lateral epicondylitis, certainly for Tommy Johns and medial tendon ruptures, he uses it twice a year (when someone begs him to do it) \nIs there a financial incentive for giving PRP instead of cortisone? \n\nCortisone is covered by insurance, and it’s only a couple hundred dollars for a shot\nPRP is $1,000 and it’s not necessarily covered by insurance\nSome people charge a lot more ($2,500) for a PRP injection\nThe concept of PRP is great‒ it has growth factors, it’s our own bodily fluids\n\nBut it hasn’t yet borne out to be a game changer\n\n\n\nThere’s not enough data to support benefits from PRP injection \n\nNow, if you take someone who’s the highest-level athlete and they have bursitis, and you inject some PRP in there, some stem cells, maybe it will be better, who knowns\nThere’s not really good data on it\nBut there’s no downside to doing it\nThe only downside Alton sometimes sees is more flare reactions from PRP injected into tennis elbow, where people are really painful for a couple of weeks\n\nThey end up coming to him for either surgery or cortisone\nThis is just anecdotal, he doesn’t have a comparative study\n\n\nPeter needs to spend more time in this literature, and notes the problem is we don’t have that natural history\n\nThere are a lot of anecdotes that say, “This injury was present. Stem cells were injected. The injury is gone radiographically.”\nWe don’t have the contra positive case\n\n\nAlton knows of a natural history study on asymptomatic rotator cuff tears that came out of WashU \n\nKen Yamaguchi was the lead on that article\nThey looked at ultrasounds which is great because they’re non-invasive, non-costly, and very effective if you have a good ultrasonographer\nThey looked at the natural history of these asymptomatic tears, and they found that they never repaired on their own\nAt very best, a subset of them stayed the same\nThe larger the tear, the more likely it was to become even larger with time \n\nAnd a subset become symptomatic \n\n\nNone got better spontaneously\n\n\nThis suggests to Peter that if people are saying, “Here’s my MRI pre and post stem cells, and it got better,” that would suggest in that individual it might have worked\nAlton agrees, but points out that MRIs vary significantly from machine to machine\n\nThat would have to be very well controlled\n“If you showed me even 20 patients done by someone that I know is legitimate and they did that and showed comparative MRIs that even 10 out of 20 showed healing and reconstitution, man, I’d be in.”\n\n\nPeter hopes that study is being done\nAnother thing to standardize is the process of generating the stem cell\n\nOne of the challenges of doing a clinical trial is everybody has to get the same drug\n\n\n\nHow standardized is the procedure for capturing and processing stem cells? \n\nIt’s non-standardized\nIt differs between different companies that bring the machines in\nIt differs between individual clinicians\n\n“It can be apples and oranges”‒ Alton Barron \n \nRepair of an AC joint separation [1:45:15]\nWhen does it just get left alone and you’re stuck with a little bit of deformation? \n\nAC separations are common injuries\n\n\nAlton sketched the AC joint with the glenohumeral joint removed (see the figure below)\n\nThe clavicle is coming across\nThere are the 2 stabilizers of the clavicle, one is the coracoid process\nThere are the coracoclavicular ligaments\nWe’re looking at it straight on\nIt’s a thumb that sticks out from yet another weird part of that scapula\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19208\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f19-altonbarron-902x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"902\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f19-altonbarron-902x1024.png 902w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f19-altonbarron-264x300.png 264w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f19-altonbarron-768x871.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f19-altonbarron.png 980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" />\nFigure 19. Separation of the AC joint.  Sketched by Alton Barron\n\nSecondarily, we have the acromioclavicular (AC) joint that we were talking about, and those are the ligaments that are circumferential around the acromioclavicular joint\nSo if you fall hard off your bike and you sprain your AC joint, we call that a type I \n\nYou stretch a little bit and injure these ligaments (drawn in red in part A of the figure above) and maybe even stretch those a tiny bit\nIt doesn’t look any different on x-ray\nThose can hurt, and those can damage the cartilage a little bit\nYou can get a grade I that persists in being painful, but generally they don’t\nThey go away\n\n\nAlton did this recently on some slime out in Dripping Springs on a bike ride \n\nThere was a low-water crossing and he just went out like it was on ice\nIt hurt for 6 weeks, and then it was gone\nIt wasn’t braced and now it’s completely normal\n\n\n\nDid you diagnose it just by pressing on it? \n\nYes, he knew by pressing right on it, it hurt like heck, but it didn’t blot\n\nIt didn’t move up and down, and he could lift his shoulder\nHe could feel it not moving\n\n\nThis is one of the things that’s biomechanically and we talk to the residents about when we’re teaching‒ it’s not that the clavicle pulls up, it’s that the shoulder falls away \n\nOne of the primary suspenders of the shoulder are these two ligamentous structures\nSo if you tear them, the shoulder kind of falls away\nSo that’s why we treat it by wearing a sling and get that heavy weight of the arm off\n\n\nBack to the figure Alton drew, in part B. there is a shadow (drawn as a dotted line)\n\nHere’s the clavicle\nWe have one acromion, which it’s sitting up about 30% or so, and that’s where you have torn the AC ligaments\n\n\nA grade II is where you’ve clearly torn the AC ligaments and it’s up by about 30%\n\nThis could be a partial or complete tear, but it just didn’t distort it too much\nAlmost all those can be treated nonoperatively\nAgain, like the I’s, they can hurt, persist, and you might have to do something later, but they’re basically stable\n\n\n\nWhen you treat it non-operatively, is the treatment that it will return to its position with elevation? \n\nSometimes, but usually not\nUsually it stays a little elevated, but people don’t really care\n\nIt’s barely asymmetric\n\n\nGrade III is where you it’s completely up\n\nWe measure that by the distance between the coracoid and the clavicle\nIn part B of the figure above, Alton drew a second coracoid process and a red arrow to express the difference in height (the coracoclavicular distance)\n\nIf it’s up to 30% widening, increase in that space, then that’s the grade II \nIf it’s 100% or more, then that’s a grade III \n\n\n\n\nThere was a good study done probably 20 years ago for NFL athletes who had sustained these, and the prevailing wisdom for the doctors who were treating the NFL teams was that most of that type III’s did not need surgical treatment\n\nBut a subset of them did go on to needing it later\n\n\nNow, in reality, when they’re up that high and people want to get back sooner, we have better reconstructive techniques now\nIf you’re a professional cyclist and you fix them, you can get back on the bike in 3-4 weeks \nSo there’s a gray zone, but the type III’s are that transition\nThe vast majority of the operative ones are in the III category\nAlton saw a weightlifter the other day and gave him the options\n\nWe can fix this tomorrow or next week\nBut you could also wait and see how you feel in 3-4 weeks because you can have the same repair then\n\nYou don’t lose anything by waiting\nBut you will lose something by waiting 3-6 months because you don’t have the same biology going on\n\n\nThis guy felt great 4 weeks later and ended up not wanting surgery\n\nThe pain was almost gone\n\n\n\n\nAsymmetry won’t have a functional impairment, generally speaking\n\nExcept if you’re doing certain exercises‒ heavy flys, heavy bench, high back squat\n\n\n\nHow the repair is done \n\nThis is where Alton differs from some people, a lot of people get in and get out quickly\nIf you have it fairly fresh and you have good ligamentous tissue in here, then we do what’s called a dog bone, which is basically 2 titanium grommets\n\nSee the blue lines in part A of the drawing above\nThis is heavy polyester suture\nWe drill through everything, drill through the clavicle, drill through the coracoid, and then, pass (these are some of his little tricks)\nPass the suture up through, pull everything down, have your assistant pull it down and you tie that over\nThen it is rock solid, and they really do well\n\n\n\nSo in other words, you don’t do it by going back to the acromion process \n\nYou get the torn ligaments to be in continuity again and then they can heal\nThe polymer is not biodegradable\n\nIt will stay forever\nThey’re super strong\n\n\nYou don’t let somebody go back to regular activity in a week, but depending on their sport, you can let them get back in maybe 3-4 weeks\n\nCertainly 6 weeks as by then, everything is pretty strong\n\n\n\nEmergency orthopedic surgery \n\nPeter just had a patient go through this, the clavicle and mediastinum separated\n\nThis is not common, but can be very problematic\n\n\nThis patient had a high fall (maybe off a horse), but what surprised Peter was the patient said, “Look, I just saw two surgeons at HSS and they said I need to have surgery right away”\nThis turned out to be one of those things in orthopedics that needs immediate surgery\nAlton drew a lordotic view basically of the manubrium sternum (see the figure below) \n\nOur breastplate is there\nWe can follow our clavicle across to that and we can feel the little nubs right there at the base\n\nWe can feel those sternoclavicular joints\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19209\"

Lordotic view of the manubrium sternum.  Sketched by Alton Barron \n\nYou can see it’s even worse than the shoulder; it’s a very shallow joint\nSo if you take a hard blow laterally (a common injury)\n\nCocky players get slammed up against a glass\nThe football players, the quarterbacks that get tackled by these 300 pounders, and their shoulders are wedged together like that\nIt just so happens that the injury that Quinn Ewers (the quarterback for UT) suffered when he was knocked out in the Alabama game\n\nHe’s now back\nSo he obviously didn’t have this full dislocation\nBut that’s what can happen, in weird circumstances such as Peter was talking about, the mechanics can be that\n\n\nIt happens a little more commonly in kids, but if the fall is just right and the mechanic’s just right, it will open this up, tear everything and then, displace it behind the manubrium\n\nAnd that’s where a major vein lives (red and blue circles at the top of the drawing above), and that can be hugely life-threatening \nWe have to be careful with those\n\n\n\n\nThis one, where it subluxes out the front are also a problem\n\nYou can see that there’s no way it’s going to fall back into place there\nSo either they stay out, they stabilize, and people just don’t do that much to irritate them\nOr they have to be reconstructed\nAlton has had to go in and reconstruct these, where he takes a tendon from the forearm and makes a figure of eight across the front to basically rebuild those ligaments to hold it back in place\n\nThis is stronger than doing an anchor or something like that\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it about the insult laterally that will determine a separation at the medial end (sternoclavicular joints) versus the lateral end (acromial end)? \n\nThese are two weak points at each end of the clavicle\nIt more frequently happens at the acromial end, but that’s usually a top down impact\n\nThat’s usually pitching forward and landing \n\n\nBut what happens more commonly than the SC joint (the sternoclavicular joint) is just a clavicle fracture (these are ubiquitous)\n\nAnd that just fractures somewhere over there \nWe fix them some and we don’t fix others (those heal)\nBut this weird little joint is very important\nDamage here is not common, but it’s not rare\n\n\n\n \nTotal shoulder replacement [1:55:45]\n\nA lot of people are pretty familiar with the total knee replacement, a total hip replacement\nFor Peter, the hip replacement has been one of the modern marvels of orthopedic surgery in the last 30 years\n\nWhen he thinks back to when he was in medical school, a shoulder replacement was a brutal procedure\nToday they are outpatient (unless you have comorbidities)\n\n\nAlton points out, “The types of implants we’re using now have evolved significantly”\nSo when you’ve worn down the cartilage completely (either on one or both of the surfaces), that’s incompatible with good function\n\nUsually because of pain \nPain is the primary indication\n\n\nAlton sees patients all the time who have the ugliest x-rays you’ve ever seen, but they have no pain and they can do whatever they want to do\n\nSo they’re fine\nOccasionally, they’ll say, “Hey, I’m going on a trip, where I want to be able to play golf for 2-3 weeks with my family.  Can you give me a cortisone shot”\n\nThey get the shot and they rock on\nThey get 3-4 months of relief and keep on going\n\n\n\n\nIt’s only the very active people who need to be able to do certain things, and age is not a factor\nAlton’s oldest patient who he did shoulder replacements on (quite a long time ago), she was 97 and she was spry and healthy\n\nShe walked the streets of Manhattan up and down, and she actually was still working at 97\nShe was the oldest and longest standing employee of a famous place\nAfter he did her surgery (back to back), he’d see her on the street, walking down 57th Street, and she’d say, “Hey doc, I’m doing great” \nIt totally changed her life, because she couldn’t use her arms and they were hurting so much\nSo age is not a factor \n\n\n\nWhat caused so much degeneration in her? \n\nSome people just get it\nIt doesn’t have to be constant subluxations\nOne of Alton’s attendings when he was in med school residence said, “Yeah, it’s like a paint job. You can have a paint job that’s a Mercedes or you can have a paint job that’s a Ford Pinto.”\n\nIt’s the quality of the paint you’re born with\nThat’s the main source of garden-variety osteoarthritis of the shoulder\n\n\nAnd then, there are the athletes who are separate categories based on wear and tear\n\nWhat is the youngest person Alton has done a shoulder replacement on? \n\nAlmost 55\nHe saw a 48-year old guy about 15 years ago who was booked for a replacement\n\nAlton told him he was too young for him to operate on and he should at least give him a shot\nHe also recommends a scope clean out \n\nThe data is not great, but anecdotally patients have about a 50% chance of getting better\n\n\nThese patients have arthritis, but they don’t have instability\nCleaning them out will buy them some more time\n\nIt’s a minimal operation, no recovery\nIf people have bilateral osteoarthritis, they don’t need both sides done and are happy with one good side\n\n\nAbout 15 years later, the guy came back and his shoulder motion was fine\n\nHis x-rays had not advanced\nHe came back for something else\n\n\n\n\nAnother of Alton’s patients was a very athletic woman who was still sailing in regattas at age 75\n\nShe was still going racing all the time, pulling lanyards, etc.\nShe complained that she couldn’t do it anymore and wanted to keep doing it\nAlton replaced both of her shoulders about 4 months apart\nShe gave up sailing for a year but is now back at it\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a shoulder replacement\n\nThere are 2 pieces to it‒ the humeral side and the glenoid side\nAlton draws what an arthritic shoulder looks like in the little picture labeled part A in the figure below\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19210\"

spur down here\nYou get some spurring around the perimeter of the glenoid, and all of that conspires to greatly diminish the motion of the shoulder and cause pain\n\n\nThere are 2 reasons patients come in\n1 – Dysfunction, because they can’t do what they desperately want to do, whether it’s recreational or work sometimes\n2 – Pain\nEither one of those is a solid indication, when the radiographic findings are there\nWe do these through a very small anterior incision and take down part or all or part or most of the subscapularis, the tendon in the front\n\nWe have to have a window in\nNow we can work through the interval, the space between the supraspinatus and the subscapularis, but only if it’s a more limited replacement\n\n\nBut anyway, you take some of the humeral head off (to the right of the diagonal black line)\n\nYou have a window there, you have retractors in, and you use an oscillating saw and just take that arthritic head off and all the bone spurs\nThen with that space that that creates, you use another retractor, push the head, what’s left of the shaft away\nAnd then, you get in and work on the glenoid and you ream that down to where it’s all smooth, get the bone spurs out of the perimeter, and then put in this little high density polyethylene socket (drawn in blue in part B of the figure above)\n\nThis is ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (very durable)\nIt’s the same thing on the tibial plateau \n\n\n\n\nWe use these little pegs by drilling holes, put in a little cement, and it’s a perfect new Teflon surface for the cobalt/ chromium (or whatever alloy it is) humeral head\n\nThe pegs are draw in black in part B of the figure above\nThe metal humeral head is shaded green to the right of the black diagonal line in part B of the figure \nThe bone has a central core and you clean that out (shaded in green to the left of the black diagonal line in part B of the figure)\nAnd this is press fit\n\nWe don’t cement these anymore, unless people have really bad bone or it’s a revision\nWe just press fit it into that cancellous bone and it’s super solid\n\n\nThe rotator cuff is still intact on top (the black line above part B of the figure), you’re working around that\n\n\nReattach the subscapularis\n\nIf you’re going to transect the subscapularis, what is the least traumatic place to do it? \nOn the tendon, where it inserts on the bone \n\nWe leave a sleeve, so we can suture tendon to tendon\nBut then, we also put this heavy suture into bone\n\nSo you’ve got bone reinforcement and you’ve got tendon to tendon healing \n\nBy doing that, you also maintain the normal length\n\nThe biggest thing this person is missing is a labrum \n\nYes, and they don’t really need it\n\nWhat stabilizes the joint? \n\nThe fact that it’s arthritic, it’s already stabilized itself\n\nUnless it’s a weird dislocating joint, which is a different entity (that you have to address that differently)\nFor the garden variety one, they’ve already stiffened up\n\n\n\n So what does their capsule look like when you go in, typically? \n\nIt’s super thick\nWe resect some of it\n\nIn a good case, what is the limitation on this person, a year out from surgery? \n\nReally nothing except heavy weights\n\nAlton doesn’t want people doing bench press or Iron Cross type things\n\n\nThey can throw a ball and play catch with their grandkids, for sure\n\nThey can play tennis and golf\nThey can shoot basketball\nThey can swim, that’s a big one what people love\n\nLater in life, it’s such good general action exercise\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this another one of those game changing operations? \n\nIt’s different than the hips and the knees, they allow people to live in the world again\nAlton won’t do them if he knows he can manage them and kick the can down the road and just inject them once a year with cortisone\nHe wants them to be dragging that arm in and saying, “You’ve got to do it now. I’m not getting enough relief from the cortisone.”\n\n \nThe elbow: anatomy, pain points, common injuries, treatments, and more [2:05:30]\nAnatomy \n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19211\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f22-altonbarron-1024x830.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"830\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f22-altonbarron-1024x830.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f22-altonbarron-300x243.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f22-altonbarron-768x623.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f22-altonbarron.png 1290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 22.  Anatomy of the elbow.  Image credit: Adapted from Wikipedia and Learn Muscles\n\nThe humerus bone is the arm bone is coming down\n\nYou see it’s a super weird undulating structure there, which makes it intrinsically quite stable \nSo different from the shoulder\n\n\n\n\nThere’s all these fun little almost jigsaw puzzle pieces that stick together\nWe have the radial head, which is the rotating bone of the forearm\nWe have the ulna, which is the fixed straight bone of the forearm\nWhat’s cool about the elbow is the tendons that go down to the forearm and to the hand originate above the joint \n\nJuxta-articular, close to the joint but above it\nAnd then, the ones that go from the shoulder and arm down attach below the joint\n\n\nIn tennis elbow a tear occurs on the radial collateral ligaments\n\nOn the inside of the elbow, where our funny bone nerve is\nThe funny bone nerve is the ulnar nerve\n\n\nOverlying that is the muscles, the flexor pronator muscles, that helps bend the elbow and pronate the forearm\n\nAnd those can tear right in this region (marked with a star in the figure above)\nThat’s actually where we get golfer’s elbow (medial epicondylitis)\nOn, the lateral side, which is the tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis)\n\n\nAnother common tendon injury occur to the biceps tendon\nThe 4th (less common), is shown in the lateral where the triceps comes down and attaches to the tip of our elbow\nWe talked about the bursa before, and there is a bursa that lives over the tip of our elbow\n\nAnd we can get the big golf ball size filling of fluid (olecranon bursitis)\n\n\nThis is beyond what we’re talking about today, to go into the fractures, but any parts of these can be broken\n\n“The elbow is a very finicky joint. You can see it’s stable, because of those undulating surfaces. But because they’re undulating, there’s less wiggle room.”‒ Alton Barron \n\nIf you don’t get those things perfect when you fix them, they can quickly lead to arthritis\nAnd some of the, even the subtle fracture patterns that happen and aren’t seen or appreciated, can lead to rapid destruction of the joint. So it’s a finicky joint.\nThere is a very thick ligament on the inside of the elbow, that is the Tommy John ligament\n\nIt’s not really Tommy John but he’ll clarify that in a minute\nThat’s the the ulnar collateral ligament, and that’s the one that’s torn in throwing athletes\n\nIt can be career ending, except now because of the reconstructive surgery, it’s generally not\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do tennis players get inflammation in the lateral epicondyle, whereas golfers get inflammation in the medial tendon? \n\n\n\nOf course, people who have never played tennis or golf often get these things\nThose are not dissimilar from the supraspinatus tendon, where they have a little ringing out and they can become degenerative and partially tear\nJust like we talked about rotator cuffs, there are tons of people walking down the streets with partial tears in those tendons, and they’re asymptomatic\n\nUse patterns are significant for that\n\n\nThe reason the lateral was historically associated and called tennis elbow is because of one-handed back hands\n\nIt’s a much less mechanically sound\nAnd we have less strength with our external rotators than we have with our pectoralis and our subscapularis for forehand shots, so it’s under more stress\n\n\nYou can get them at any age\nAlton treats a lot of people age 40-60 \n\nAnd now that’s creeping up to the 70’s\n\n\nNow in competitive tennis players, he’s seeing just as much medial epicondylitis, which is traditionally golfer’s elbow\n\nAnd the reason is because everybody is trying to hit massive top spin \nAnd they are hit using their pronators so much more than they used to, and that’s a reason why it is stimulated more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, even golfers were getting it\n\n\nAlton don’t know why, because you’re not supposed to be overhitting with your trailing arm\n\n\nMost people play right-handed and they were getting it on their right medial epicondylitis because they were overhitting, hitting stumps, hitting rocks, duffing\n\n\nAnd it was that jolt, again, the eccentric load on these tendons, which our tendons don’t like\n\n\nBut now he’s seeing, because golfers are hitting so much harder, they’re hitting bigger clubs (especially drivers and such) and they’re getting more left leading arm lateral epicondylitis\n\n\nThis causes damage on the leading arm when they’re just trying to hit harder and farther \n\nFirst line treatment \n\nThe first line of treatment is always rest, good stretching (just like you stretch your hamstrings to keep from tearing them as frequently or injuring them as frequently), and usually NSAIDs by mouth\nRarely does he use physical therapy for these formally, because it’s just not much to do\nSometimes they’re very painful\n\nSome people wake up in the morning, they can’t even straighten their elbow out\nThe elbow is spongy and really inflamed\n\nHe doesn’t splint those but has them stretch \nMore often, because they can’t use their arm, he will go ahead and give them a half dose of cortisone just to cool everything down\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter’s experience with elbow pain \n\nPeter remembers Alton injected him 4-5 years ago when he was in the transition of really learning how to control his scapula and had overcooked doing too many pullups\n\nThe pullup pain was translating into tennis elbow, which surprised him\nIt was a stubborn pain\nHe went to see Alton after 6 months of pain, but that 1 injection cooled it off\nIt never hurt again because he had already fixed the underlying movement pattern\n\n\n\nIs this a common scenario? \n\nYes, it’s common and this is one reason why Alton doesn’t operate right away\nHe operates on 20% at the most\n\nMost people get better after a cortisone shot and correcting the underlying movement pattern \nWhat are the indications for operating on the lateral versus the medial side? \n\nThe indications are the same‒ failing conservative treatment\n\nA lot of stretching and strengthening\n\n\nA lot of people get these\nIn Peter’s case, it was mechanics and overdoing\n\nMany people get these because they’re getting back into something that they haven’t done in a long time and they overdo it \n\nIt can be weightlifting or something more mundane like lifting your luggage around on a 2 week vacation\n\nThe theme is conditioning, if people don’t have grip strength and are weak\n\nStrengthening is a critical component\nAlton has a device he has patents squeeze, and if they can squeeze that without a little pain, he has them do that first\n\nOften it will cure it\nBut if they can’t squeeze it without undue pain, he gives them a little dose of cortisone\n\n\nIf it’s chronic, like Peter’s was, then there’s not that much to do\n\nPeter is fit, he’s got great tone and full motion\nSo he only needed a little booster dose of cortisone to knock it out\n\n\nWe think sometimes just sticking the needle in a few times kind of stimulates a healing response (we haven’t ever done the study to prove it)\n\nPeter has seen a lot of anecdotal stuff around dry needling\nJust increasing the influx of inflammatory cells and getting macrophages to come and clean it up\n\n\n\nOutside of fractures, how often does Alton see acute injuries to the elbow, that ultimately are surgical cases? \n\nAntecedent elbow pain or forearm pain is common in middle age in a very active/ fit person\n\nThey don’t know what did it but they ruptured their distal biceps and they get a Popeye muscle (see the figure below)\n\n\nThe bicep is the primary supinator of the forearm and a secondary elbow flexor\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19212\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f23-altonbarron-1024x741.png\" alt=\"\"

Credit: Riley Williams, MD\nSo when people tear their biceps, they don’t lose that much flexion strength, but they lose most of their supination strength  \n\nSo if they are used to turning screwdrivers, wrenches, surgical instruments, maybe depending on what they do, then it can be really disabling.\nIn the exam, patients will come in and they won’t be in pain but will have a deformity\n\nAlton will pronate them to wrap that tendon kind of around the radius, and then have them pull up, like they’re doing a pronated curl‒ and they scream\n\nYou get it just isolated\n\n\nAnd then, you test their supination, and they didn’t know that they didn’t have any supination strength\nThen you’d test their other side and they can lift you off the table\n\n\n\nWhen you surgically repair that, are you reattaching the tendon? \n\nYeah, it’s like a tendonisis \nAfter surgery, many patients say they feel stronger than before the injury\n\nBut they probably had a partial tear for a long time\nThey were working around, they were little decondition in their biceps, they were compensating with their brachialis, the big muscle underneath that\nAnd then, they get even stronger, because they have a good tendon again\n\n\n\n \nHow Tommy John surgery revolutionized Major League Baseball [2:17:15]\n\nThis is a tear on the medial side from the ligament being subjected to super physiologic torques\n\nThink high-level throwers who are throwing 90+ mph\n\n\nWhen the medial collateral ligament (aka ulnar collateral ligament) is subjected to such traction forces, it will rupture (see the figure below)\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19213\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f24-altonbarron-1024x764.png\" alt=\"\"

biceps, triceps, and so forth\n\n\nBy strengthening everything around it, you can protect that ligament\nAnd if you don’t, then it can rupture, because it’s being subjected repetitively over and over and over again year after year to super physiologic loads\nWhen it ruptures‒ instantaneously, they lose 10 miles per hour on their fast ball\n\nThey can still throw, but it just immediately downgrades their ability to throw\n\n\n\nMost of us can’t throw a ball 50 mph.  Does this mean I would go from 50 to 40?  Would I notice a difference? \n\nThis is a common fallacy\nYou would notice it\nIf we’re playing catch, we don’t need the ligament\n\nThis is really an operation only for the most elite throwers \n\nWhat was done on Tommy John was not the same operation\n\nIt was the same ligament, but it was totally different now\nIt’s good to refer to it as that\nThe guy who invented it was brilliant\n\n\nSome parents will bring their kids in asking for this surgery, who say, “We know our kid has this great potential” but their kid has no problem \n\nBecause so many people have had partial tears (like the biceps), and once they have a reconstruction, they can throw 5-7 mph faster \nNews of

William Littler, who was one of the most famous, living hand surgeon, for a few decades in the world, was exposed to that at Valley Forge and elsewhere during the war\n\nAnd that’s how he and other luminaries in the field developed these techniques that brought us where we are today\n\n\nThe most significant advancement, since Alton graduated and went into private practice, has been the the complete hand transplantation \n\nIt involves general surgeons, it involves hand surgeons, it involves a huge team to be able to do that\nAnd the results are mixed\nAs recently as 5 years ago, only a few had been done\nOnly in the last several years have these teams been built up at larger institutions to be able to handle this\n\nEven then, it’s fraught with peril\nYou have to have a patient in  perfect physiology as any comorbidities greatly decrease the likelihood of success\nAnd it requires a huge investment for the patients themselves\n\n\nA bilateral hand amputee is usually the one that can qualify for this surgery (as opposed to a single hand amputee), and they have to meet all the physiologic parameters\n\n\nThe hand transplantation is joined at the midpoint of the wrist\n\nAt the distal forearm where you’re beyond that transition zone and can link up tendon to tendon\nThe nerves need to be linked as well\n\n\nYou have to HLA match these things because they’re all cadaveric\nThe only other thing that’s changed a lot, that relates so much to the hand, is the spinal implants and the various types of full muscle transfers that can restore function in the hand for someone who previously had no ability to control even a prosthesis\n\n“These electrical prosthesis now that are linked to the brain, it’s cool”‒ Alton Barron\nAre there injuries in the forearm where they will take a muscle from the leg (or something like a sartorius) and attach it there? \n\nAbsolutely, and it’s really intended to just give some primitive function back \n\nTo be able to flex the elbow for instance, or extend the elbow or flex the wrist\n\n\nIt’s really more the elbow more than anything because most of these injuries, the patients can still control their shoulder, can position the arm somewhere \nBut if you just have an elbow extension contracture where you cannot flex better than 90 degrees, you can’t get your hand to your mouth, to your hair, to your face‒ you can’t do a lot \n\nThere are many limitations just trying to get through an average day \n\n\n\nWhat fraction of those injuries that require surgical intervention are the result of an acute trauma versus chronic injury (wear and tear)? \n\nIt varies depending on where you are\nAlton took trauma calls for a couple of decades, but not any more\nHe sees cold trauma that still needs surgery, but it’s not acute\n\n It’s subacute and it needs to be fixed in a delayed fashion\n\n\nIf you are in a practice such as a county hospital where there’s trauma coming in (whether it’s hunters, highways, etc.), then a much higher percentage of your day and your week is spent repairing acute, traumatic, often polytrauma injuries\nAlton is in a mature metropolitan type practice where it’s more in the area of 50/50\n\nThere’s plenty of arthritic conditions, of wear and tear conditions (gym work, or getting back into various forms of exercise, or the weekend warrior phenomenon)\n\nAnd those are not dramatic traumatic injuries\n\n\nAnd then there are the people that are falling off the scooters and water skiing and dislocating their shoulders, all that spectrum\nBut the actual acute… something as mundane as cutting avocados, he sees tons of nerve injuries and tendon injuries in the palm\n\n\n\nBut it’s usually spread pretty evenly between arthritic and sports related ruptures and injuries, and then fractures and dislocations and ruptures due to traumatic events \nPeter’s takeaway: If the bony anatomy of the shoulder is a little more straightforward, it starts to get a little more complicated in the elbow and it gets a little more rigid.  The hand is really complex. \n \nThe hand: anatomy, common injuries, and surgeries of the hand and wrist [2:29:30]\nAnatomy of the hand\n\nThere are 3 bones in each finger (except for the thumb, which has 2), so 12+2 = 14 bones\nThen you have the next layer, which are the metacarpals, 5 of those\nAnd then the carpal bones in the wrist are 8 small bones\n\nThey are are called coalitions where they’re fused together\nAlton had a resident that used to make fun of hand surgeons who would say, “Never operate on a bone you can swallow” \nHe was just, in a fun way, piling the fine smaller, caliber things that we’re dealing with in the hand and wrist region\n\n\nThe wrist owns the one bone that is the hardest to heal in the body, the scaphoid bone (see the figure below)\n\n“It’s like a carob coated cashew”\nIt’s almost all encompassed by cartilage\nSo there’s only a couple of little areas where tiny blood vessels can get into that bone, and unlike almost all the other bones in our body, we don’t have what we call antegrade flow into that bone (leaving the heart going down through the arteries and the capillaries and going into the bone from point A distally to point B)\n\nIt goes in retrogrades\nSo if you crack that bone in the middle (at baseline), it has very little blood supply, and you probably disrupt it\nThis one generally takes 10-12 weeks to heal (compared to 6 weeks for the average bone)\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19215\"

What is it about having the wrist in this position that for us, general surgeons, would be basically, “Let’s just let the hand guys look at this tomorrow morning. We don’t have to call them at two o’clock in the morning if this is a non-operative or non-urgent issue, but let’s at least put them in this safe position.””\n\nA neutral position in terms of the carpus, some wrist extension \n\nToo much flexion or too much extension increases the pressure on the median nerve and the carpal tunnel (see the figure of nerves in the arm below)\nSo people can get acute carpal tunnel syndrome (especially with some extra swelling from the injury) \n\nThat can be quite substantial in those more extreme positions\n\n\nSo a neutral position is best for function in terms of if you’re in a splint\nBut at least trying to get some finger movement, maybe typing at a keyboard or something, then that’s a good neutral position\nOn occasion if Alton has to immobilize a musician for example, he will immobilize them in the position they need to play their instrument\n\nEverybody’s different\nIt’s an important consideration\n\n\n\nWhat do we need to understand about the anatomy of the radial bone, the ulna bone, and these 2 big nerves (the median nerve and ulnar nerve)? \n\nThe median nerve and ulnar nerve are shown in the figure below\n\nThe ulnar nerve runs on the pinky side\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19217\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f28-altonbarron-1024x698.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"698\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f28-altonbarron-1024x698.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f28-altonbarron-300x205.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f28-altonbarron-768x524.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f28-altonbarron-1536x1048.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f28-altonbarron.png 1830w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 28.  A.

flexor tendons in each finger (shown above) and 1 in the thumb (9 total)\nIf we look at our palm up, the median nerve is running down almost the center of the wrist and it is vulnerable to compression \n\nSo that if we then flex our wrist down, those flexor tendons are trying to bow string down, they will press that median nerve up against that rigid transverse carpal ligament\nSwelling (edema) can compress that nerve as well (a problem with rheumatoid arthritis)\nThe tendons aren’t really vulnerable in that way, but the nerve is very vulnerable to compression, and that’s why it’s such a ubiquitous problem\n\n\n\nWhich functions are controlled by the median nerve versus the ulnar nerve? \n\nPeople often come to Alton thinking they have carpal tunnel syndrome (because it’s so ubiquitous)\nCarpal tunnel syndrome must have numbness and tingling in the median nerve distribution\n\nWhich is the palm side of the thumb, index, middle, and usually half of the ring finger\n\n\nHowever, if you have an arthritic process, without having as much numbness and tingling, you can have isolated atrophy of the muscles\n\nYou have atrophy of the thumb muscles\n\nIt can be very gradual\nIt occurs from the encroachment on that nerve of bone spurs that grow through he arthritic process\n\n\n\n\nRarely in a younger person, Alton will see where they have an odd motor branch, which is the nerve that comes off the median nerve that goes to those muscles\n\nThey’ll have a weird compression of just that without any numbness and tingling\nBut they will have isolated atrophy, and that needs to be addressed surgically\n\n\n\nPeople who often get carpal tunnel syndrome \n\nPregnant women often have carpal tunnel in the 3rd trimester simply due to swelling and fluid imbalances \nPeople can get carpal tunnel if they’re always pressing down and putting extra pressure on that area\n\nIt’s a dynamic situation\nPeople who use jackhammers \nOr people who are cyclists and they’re always pressing down and putting extra pressure on that area can get carpal tunnel syndrome only when they’re cycling.\nWeightlifters can get it, depending on the style of what they’re doing\n\n\n\n“Generally speaking, most people don’t get carpal tunnel just from typing”‒ Alton Barron \n\nThere was a massive class action lawsuit against IBM many years ago, and they lost the case because there was no data to suggest that it was caused by just using a keyboard\nHowever, if you already have it, typing will absolutely exacerbate it\n\nThat’s why ergonomics are so important, how you’re sitting\n\n\nDuring COVID, everybody went back home and worked from home and worked at random places (the kitchen table, with their laptop in bed)\n\nAlton saw a lot more of both wrist tendonitis and carpal tunnel syndrome after that\nThat doesn’t affect the ulnar nerve, it involves the median nerve\n\n\n\nThe ulnar nerve \n\nWhile our opposable thumb is critically important, that’s governed mostly by the median nerve\nThe ulnar nerve is so important because it supplies almost all the rest of the small muscles (intrinsic muscles) of the hand \n\nThese allow us to spread our fingers apart, pull our fingers together, do these weird funky positions that we do\nLike the intrinsic plus position, that is almost all ulnar nerve\n\n\nThe intrinsic flexors are ulnar\nThe extrinsics are split between the median (more approximately in the forearm) \nFrom an evolutionary perspective, the hand is a pretty primitive structure\n\nExcept for the opposable thumb\n\n\nOur foot is fantastically adapted and modified over evolution to walk\n\nWhen we stood up, our food completely changed\n\n\nOur brains grew when we started using our hands and making tools\n\nThat’s when our heads enlarged\n\n\n\n \nOther common injuries of the hand and forearm [2:47:15]\nThere are 3 categories of common hand injuries \n\n1 – Acute traumatic events (usually fractures, sometimes dislocations) \n2 – Wear and tear injuries (begin in middle age and go on into older age)\n3 – Degenerative arthritic types of problems \n\nThis will vary among individuals based on genetics and lifestyle\n\n\n\nFractures \n\nThe most common by far is the distal radius fracture (the big bone of the radius near the wrist)\nNow, the the forearm is super cool (shown in the figure below)\n\n<img

that we talked about is the elbow bone that we feel, the prominence of our elbow\n\nThat’s a straight bone and that goes down and it forms the bump here that we see on the back of our wrist\n\n\nThe radius is a curved, arching bone \n\nThe radius is flared and provides the biggest structure at the wrist level, but it’s much smaller at the elbow level\nIt rotates around through a fixed ulna (the ulna never moves rotationally) a\nSo any disruption of that can dramatically alter our ability to hold a bowl of soup or to pronate and type and write\nAnd that can be disrupted in many ways\n\n\nIt’s super common to fall and have a bending moment on the radius that fractures and displaces it\n\nAlton sees this commonly in kids who fall off jungle gyms\n\nThey’ll have both a forearm fracture and a mid forearm fracture, and that’s just another bending moment\n\n\nThat can very much disrupt the function there\n\n\nAt any different point along the forearm (depending on the mechanism), these bones can break\nAnd if they’re displaced, we have to often fix them (except in very young kids)\n\nNursemaid’s elbow \n\nA nursemaid’s elbow occurs when a parent grabs a kid by the arm to yank them across the road\nThis is a subluxation of that round radial head at the elbow\nAlton had the interesting and formative experience to create one in his first daughter\n\nHe remembers spinning her around, she was giggling and so forth\nThen he felt just the tiniest little weird movement in her elbow, it kind of threw her hand\nHe saw her face start to scrunch up and set her down\nThen he just had this vision, he knew what it was\nHe quickly did the reduction maneuver so fast that she hadn’t even started crying, and then it just immediately stopped hurting\n\n\n\n\nWhen you pronate, it will cause that radial head just to slip out (pop up) a little bit\nSo the easy maneuver is you supinate (twist the forearm towards the core so the palm faces up) and flex the elbow up with a little pressure (bend at the elbow to bring the hand up to the chest)\n\nThis is the most stable position of that bone\nAnd it will pop right back in every time\n\n\nIf it stays out and you sit in an emergency room for 6-8 hours, then it’s harder to get back in\n\nYou’ll often have to do it under anesthesia\n\n\nPeter has seen a lot of radial fractures in friends and kids and it really seems like one of those awful luck things\n\nIf you fall out of a tree, slip on ice, etc.\n\n\nThen the older we get, if we have a little osteopenia or osteoporosis, then it takes less and less force to fracture those bones\n\nDoes the ulna ever break on its own? \n\nThe most common cause is a direct blow\nFor example in football, it can be a weight falling\nIt can be a door smashing into you, that’s called a nightstick fracture\n\nNamed for the billy clubs in the UK where it would strike you when you had was up and it cracks the ulna\nThat’s the most common\n\n\nOften it is fractured in association with the distal radius\n\nThe styloid part can come off, it’s attached to a ligament or it can just both snap same time, and that complicates the treatment\n\n\nThen the other common one is really more of an elbow fracture, it’s the ulna (the olecranon) \n\nThat’s when you fall on your elbow\nThe only other way you can pull that bone off is if you fall really hard, say snow skiing\nWith the eccentric load, that triceps pulls it right off\nAlton loves that Peter educates so many people about eccentric loading because it’s more injurious in a way \n\n\n\nWhat chronic injuries of the hand and wrist ultimately require surgical care? \n\nOveruse patterns are more tendonitis\nThere are subtle differences between tendonitis and tenosynovitis\nTendonitis is just inflammation in the tendon\n\nIf the tendon is beginning to wear and tear and degenerate, you’ll get some longitudinal fissuring in those collagen fibers and then it fills in with some inflammatory tissue, and then that can envelope the tendon\nThis is a constant rubbing and further degeneration of that\nYou get chronic pain\nYou can inject it with cortisone, but ultimately they can rupture depending on how much force they’re being subjected to and for how long it’s been there\n\n\nTenosynovitis is a subset of that where we have these effectively watertight tubes, on our flexor tendons (the synovium)\n\nOur body produces a little bit of lubricating fluid to keep the tendons gliding smoothly in there \nIt can get inflamed from overuse and the tendon becomes trapped in there and it really hurts\nIt can limit mobility and can even cause the tendon to lock down sometimes\nHe often cures this with a cortisone shot, rest, or both\nA subset of them ultimately require surgery (which is very minor)\n\n\nThis is important for hand function\n\nIf you have one finger that’s really stiff, whether you dislocated it or even just sprained it, the other fingers, they’re all linked so indelibly together that actually it will make your whole hand feel stiff\n\n\n\n \nGrip strength [2:55:15]\n\nPeter is obsessed with grip strength and about a year ago he started experimenting with training the way rock climbers do, where you’re only using finger strength\n\nWhat blew him away was how much weaker he felt all the way through his lats when he would restrict the amount of fingers he used to do a pull-up\nIt took him a while to work up to 10, 4-finger pull-ups (a couple months)\n\nThen he moved to 3-finger pull-ups, and that was an order of magnitude harder\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it when I use only 3 fingers that all of my strength fades away? \n\nAlton has a couple of theories\n1 – It could be that your brain is holding you back\n\nFor example, this applies to the weakness you feel and detect asymmetrically in a rotator cuff \nIf you have a small partial thickness rotator cuff tear (tiny and  mechanically not relevant), yet you can be quite weak\nYour brain is so smart, it knows it doesn’t want to overstress that area\nAlton’s instinct is that the first reaction, especially when you’ve never done that before, is for your brain to say, “Whoa, that’s putting way too much tension on the other one. So I’m going to relax everything. I’m not going to give you what you need because they may rupture.”\n\n\nWhat’s ironic is that the ulnar nerve is much more important for grip strength\n\nThis innervates only 2 fingers‒ the pinky and ring finger \n\n\n\n\nLet’s say you have an ulnar nerve that’s completely in and a median nerve that’s out, you’re going to be pretty strong still\nWhereas if you have an ulnar nerve out and a median nerve that’s still in, you’re going to be much weaker\n\nThe middle finger, forefinger and thumb are under the median nerve distribution\n\n\n\nPeter’s takeaway: \n\nThe pinky and ring finger matter more to grip strength than middle finger, fore finger, thumb\nYou can engage your forearms much more with your pinky and ring finger\nHe is endlessly fascinated by what our hands are capable of\n\nIt’s such a force multiplier for our species\nIt’s an unbelievable asset in our ability to carry things\n\nMichael Easter has written about this in his book The Comfort Crisis, which introduced us all to rucking\nOther animals (domesticated) can carry a lot on their back, but we can carry our body weight in our hands  \n\n\nAlton adds, “When you look at the Vitruvian man and when you look at the standard anatomic position of in medicine, the elbow has a carrying angle built into it to get whatever we’re carrying away from our body so we can carry more. So we have a 12 to 15 degree natural built in, what’s called valgus or away from our bodies to give us more area to carry heavy things with.”\n\n\n\n \nArthritis in the hands [2:59:30]\n\nThere are 2 types\n1 – Rheumatoid arthritis \n\nAn autoimmune form of arthritis\nIt impedes function and physically deforms the fingers in the joints\n\n\n2 – Common osteoarthritis \n\nMore of a wear and tear problem\nIt’s doesn’t have an autoimmune component\n\n\nCurrently Alton sees very few rheumatoid arthritis patients because there is so much more medical therapy available for them now\n\nThe biologics are amazing, an absolute game changes in keeping people normal for a long time\n\n\nWhen he started his practice he would operate as often in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, but now he sees maybe 1 a month that needs surgery\n\nIt’s pretty rare\n\n\n\nFor Rheumatoid arthritis \n\nSurgery is needed because of functional limitations in the hand\n\nThis can also occur in the elbow and shoulder\n\n\nIt’s a tendon subluxation, joint deviation that weakens their hand and decreases their ability to remain independent\n\nFor Wear and tear osteoarthritis \n\nThis varies among individuals\nSome people have really good hands until the very end\nAlton compares it to a nice paint job on a car and a cheap one\nThere’s a big genetic component\nHe will see some young patients (50 years old) that already have a lot of visible alterations\n\nNot affecting function so much as they are getting the knobbiness and inflammation in the joints\n\n\n\nArthritis at the base of the thumb \nArthritis at the base of the thumb is ubiquitous, about 50% of all of us will develop this \n\nIt’s a biomechanics problem, there are 6 degrees of freedom\nIt’s this biconcave saddle joint that in order to come back and forth this way (radial and ulnar deviation), then straight up (palmar abduction), and then rotating around and pronating in order to oppose the thumb tip to the fingertips\nIt’s doing 3 different directional movements and it just wears out\nIt’s just subjected to so many odd stresses and it’s unstable like the shoulder\n\nIn what fraction of those people will osteoarthritis at the base of the thumb pose a functional limitation, more than something that is treatable with some Aleve here and there?  \n\nWe don’t know the exact subset\nMany people walk around with osteoarthritis and never have pain\n\nThey have some stiffness and some deformity\n\n\nOf the people that present with some pain, about 25% of those potentially are going to need surgery for that at some point \n\nThis would be around 12.5 % of the overall population\n\n\n\n“One fourth of the people that present with pain in the thumb are going to need surgery”‒ Alton Barron\nWhat is the surgical procedure? \n\nIt varies depending on what stage they present at, but it’s some form of reconstruction\nUnlike the hips and knees that are so ubiquitous and so wonderful, we don’t have those kind of great implants for this\n\nThey don’t work\nThere’s very high failure rates\nIf a hip replacement or a knee replacement has a 5% failure rate at 5 or 10 years, the thumbs are 70% failure rate\n\n\nWhat we use is basically a reconstruction using your own tissue\nBecause of the way we evolved, we have so much protective redundancy (this is super cool)\n\nWe have so many tendons\nAll of the flexor tendons that flex the fingers also flex the wrists and give a strength\nWe have multiple tendons that pull the thumb out\n\nThey do subtle differences\nBut we use those for tendon grafts\n\n\n\n\nGoing back to evolution, hold your hands out and touch the tips of your thumbs and pinky finger \n\nThere is a big tendon that pops up on the underside of the wrist/ forearm\nAlton has it on his right arm but not his left, and Peter has huge ones on both sides\nThat’s the palmaris longus\nThose are hugely developed in quadrupeds, in horses and so forth, a big important muscle\nBut they don’t do anything in us so they are used as a tendon graft all the time\nWe’re evolving, 15% of people don’t have this\n\n\n\nDoes that mean you’re not actually addressing the surface of the saddle joint, which is arthritic in this procedure? \n\nYou’re not recreating some artificial joint (at the base of the thumb)\nWhat we’re creating is a pseudoarthrosis\n\nWe stabilize it, get it stabilized back on top\nAlton takes a little bit of the bone off to create a space and then he rolls up the rest of that tendon and put it in there as a cushion\nThis relieves the pain and restores function\n\n\nThis operation has a high level of success\n\n“I don’t know how I didn’t realize you could make a case that roughly 5-10% of the population will require this at some point in their life.”‒ Peter Attia\n\nThis is the single most common, non-traumatic surgical repair of the hand along with a trigger finger\n\n \nTrigger finger [3:07:45]\n\nTrigger finger is what we were talking about before with inflammation of the tendon sheath\n\nRight in the middle of the hand, there’s a series of pulleys \n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19222\"

the figure above)\n\nThe metacarpal and 3 bones of the phalanges\nThe metacarpal is hidden in the hand\n\n\nThe flexor tendon is drawn in black, this allows you to do your pull-ups \nIf you had a muscle attached to this and you pulled on it and didn’t have those blue structures (pulleys), then this would bowstring just like a fishing pole\n\nIf you don’t put the fishing line through the eyelets, then it just stays way away; and it’s actually stronger that way, but you lose all the mobility, you lose the capacity to really curl your fingers tightly\n\n\nThe tendon is gliding through the tendon sheath and held closely to finger bones by pulleys\n\nThe A1 pulley is shown in the figure below\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19223\"

climbing)\n\nThey can rupture because you’re putting so much force on those in such funky positions and isolating 2 fingers, 1 finger, and so forth\nAlton sees that a lot in rock climbers\n\n\n\nThe point here is that as you’re rubbing constantly going back and forth (whether you’re playing a concerto or you’re rock climbing) and you can get inflamed along that sheath \n\nThis particular pulley here is down in the palm (A1), that’s the most common site to have inflammation to where you can even get some nodular swelling in the tendon \n\nAnd that thickening up of that pulley, then it just actually catches\n\n\nWe call it a trigger finger because it has a feeling like pulling a trigger on a gun\nThey’re ubiquitous\n\nTreatment \n\nWe frequently inject those with cortisone and frequently have to operate\n\nIf you take someone who presents within say 6 weeks of onset, there’s about a 75% cure rate with 1 or 2 injections\n\n\nThe longer you wait, the more potential damage and more chronic inflammation that ensues\nIn these types of soft tissue procedures, we don’t keep injecting cortisone because it can lead to soft tissue degradation\n\nAnd ultimately even tendon ruptures (Alton has never seen one, but it can happen)\n\n\n\nWhat is the rule of thumb for how many times you’ll put in a cortisone shot?\n3 in the lifetime of a tendon sheath \n\nUnless it’s very, very broad\nUsually, you don’t see someone back 10 years later who needs another injection\n\nExtensor tendons versus flexor tendons\n\nThe extrinsic extensor tendon will straighten up the knuckles, but then we look further out and see that tendon stops at the middle knuckle\nWhat pulls the whole finger straight is actually this intrinsic muscle that’s tapering down and has a very thin tendon\n\nIt turns into a lateral band and it travels from the palm side up above the middle knuckle, above that axis of rotation\nThen it goes all the way on and attaches to the tip\nIt’s a super cool mechanism that through a series of mechanical placements, it’s able to extend (straighten) the finger by contracting\nBut it doesn’t take much to damage that tendon\n\nIf you take a direct blow to that knuckle and that tendon slips because you’ve disrupted some soft tissue, it can slip below the axis of rotation, then it becomes a flexor and you get a Boutonnière deformity\nThen you cannot straighten your finger up because those lateral bands that are used to extend the finger have slipped down and become a flexor\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency surgery in the hand \n\nPeter vaguely remembers one emergency surgery in the hand where that sheath had become infected\nAlton notes, “Yes. It’s one of the few really orthopedic emergencies in the hand, which is tenosynovitis, and then it becomes separative (or infected) with puss in there. I mean, there’s so many nerves in our hand anyway, when you get even a few drops of purulent puss in the finger sheath, it hurts like crazy. And your posture is down like this. You can’t straighten your finger up at all. And it’s exquisitely tender and it looks swollen just along that sheath… It’s an operative emergency.”\n\nHow does a person get that infection? \n\nIt can be an open injury or even a pin prick\n\nSometimes an insect bite or sting\nIf you’re using sports equipment, you can get a little graphite puncture\n\n\nAlton doesn’t see them as much now because he’s not in the ER\nThey’re ubiquitous and they come in all the time, year round\n\n***\nHand & wrist exam:\n<iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"

[3:14:00]\nParsonage-Turner syndrome \n\nMany people present with numbness, tingling, weakness or pain in the upper limb\nIt can start from the neck where the nerve roots exit and travel under our collarbone through the brachial plexus in between the scaling muscles and then travels through our armpit and then comes down in through the arm and into the hand\nIt can be confounding\nAn example is Parsonage-Turner syndrome (aka brachial neuritis, as in brachial plexus neuritis)\n\nIt’s uncommon but a fascinating study in that whole process from the neck down\nIt’s an inflammation of those nerves\nWe think it’s probably viral related because there’s usually a viral prodrome associated, but it doesn’t have to be\nIt’s an acute dramatic onset of pain all through here\nIt is a mixed plexopathy can be in multiple different nerves\nIt’s a mixed bag of palsy, weakness, and numbness\nOne of the most common presenting ways is in the long thoracic nerve, which is part of the brachial plexus\nYou get scapular winging where you lift your arm up and it just falls down because your scapula cannot support the shoulder and arm weight\n\nBecause the muscle of the shoulder girdle cannot support that\n\n\nIt presents as a mix, it affects multiple nerves because those nerves are more common up here and then they diverge into the different nerves\n\nAlton still remembers trying to learn the brachial plexus in med school and it was brutal because it’s really complicated\n\n\nThese are people who show up and you certainly couldn’t attribute what they’re experiencing to any one thing\n\nIt’s like they would have to have six lesions simultaneously\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this self-limiting or do you give these people steroids? \n\nWe give them steroids and most recover completely\nA few have some residual defects long-term\n\nShoulder pain that originates in the neck \n\nAlton has a tone of patients who present with shoulder pain and they may have a little something on their MRI, but that shoulder pain is actually coming from their neck\nHe’ll have someone who will present with carpal tunnel syndrome, but there’s a little extra stuff going on\n\nMaybe some ulnar nerve in the little finger, maybe some shoulder pain, maybe some arm pain\n\n\nThe cool thing diagnostically speaking is an intrinsic shoulder problem (such as a rotator cuff tear, inflammation, bursitis, etc.) usually travels down underneath the pain, underneath the big deltoid muscle, but almost never goes below the elbow\n\nIf Alton sees pain that’s in the shoulder going below the elbow, he’s thinking maybe neck or maybe something else \n\nSecondarily, if someone complains of numbness here and some numbness on the back of the hand, the radial nerve is rarely involved in association with carpal tunnel or cubital tunnel \n\nThe patient will say, “Oh yeah, my neck’s been really stiff” \n\nJust subtle little cues that you can get by speaking with them\n\n\nThey could have something called double crush, and that is where you get pinching of the nerve in the neck\n\nMaybe through a disc, maybe through a foraminal osteophyte that narrows that little canal it passes through\nAnd then because the axoplasmic flow (or the nerve tube), the communication of it is disrupted or compressed, it renders them more susceptible to milder compression down at the carpal tunnel or the cubital tunnel at the elbow\n\n\nSo they’re getting a double crush now\n\n\nAlton doesn’t treat necks other than some initial PT and maybe steroids \n\nHe refers those out\n\n\nBut many patients will then see a neck surgeon who will say they don’t need surgery and they tell Alton to go ahead and treat\n\nHe’ll do a carpal tunnel release and their carpal tunnel will go away, but they’ll still have some upper nerve pain\n\n\nRecently Alton learned from a really smart neck surgeon about compression in the lower level, C7 nerve root\n\nCompression here goes deep under the scapula and gives a problem there\nThis was helpful as Alton often sees patients develop scapulothoracic bursitis\n\n\nYou can get scapulothoracic bursitis from lifting weights (especially if you’ve been out of the weight room for a long time, and you go back into it) \n\nYou can get a lot of upper trapezius, parascapular, rhomboid type pain from overuse and those overlap\n\n\nSo you really have to do the diagnostic work and talk to the patients and listen to the patients to differentiate that\n\nExample of a complicated patient \n\nThe one patient that illustrates how complicated it can be was someone who had a bad shoulder fracture\n\nHe was treated in the emergency department, put into a sling, but then also maybe told to do pendulum exercises\n\n\nWell, it was an unstable fracture, very unstable\nThe weight of the arm is enormous, and all that weight pulling on an unstable fracture, that put tremendous traction on the nerves\n\nIt ended up killing his ulnar and median nerve\n\n\nHe came and he couldn’t pose his thumb, he couldn’t do anything\nAll Alton had left to work with was the radial nerve innervate (which are the wrist extensors and the supinators), and he was able to transfer some things and give him back some pretty good function\nBut it was all just due to traction\n\nHow long did it take those nerves to die under traction? \n\nIt was super fast\nAlton saw him 8 weeks post-op\nHe said he began to lose hand function within 3 weeks of the fracture\nIt’s tragic that no one picked up on this\n\n***\nNerve exam:\n<iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"

the Musician Treatment Foundation about 6 years ago\nThis is indirectly how Peter met Alton, through a doctor in New York City who got to know  Alton through his work taking care of musicians \n\nAlton’s passion for music \n\nWhen he started his practice in New York City,  he was lucky enough to inherit caring for the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestras (mainstays of classical music echelon)\n\nThat spilled over into Broadway and then jazz musician, rock and roll, and so forth\n\n\nHe’s always loved music and had a passion for it\nTo be able to take care of musicians is both very stressful initially and incredibly rewarding\n\nThey’re like athletes, they’re doing this day in and day out\nIt’s their livelihood and if it’s disrupted, then both their mental health and their financial health is greatly jeopardized\n\n\nFor his whole career, Alton has been taking care of freelance musicians (and their significant others) who doesn’t know when your next gig is and can’t afford insurance\n\nHe was always discounting his cost (sometimes down to nothing)\n\n\n\n“The costs are absolutely exorbitant for healthcare”‒ Alton Barron \n\nWaiving his cost is one thing, but he can’t waive the cost of anesthesia or the surgeon center\nThe average cost for a rotator cuff repair is about $25,000\n\nIf you pay out of pocket at a surgery center (which is cheaper than the hospital)\n\n\nThe average income for a fully professional, freelance musician in Austin is about $16,000 a year (pre-COVID)\nThis was what was going on for years and it was always in my mind, always upsetting Alton\nAlton laments that our culture doesn’t support the arts more\n\nPatient zero \n\nAlton’s cousin Thor is a mainstay of the Austin music scene, he cut his digital nerve (his finger)\n\nHe’s a percussionist and now he couldn’t play because such a neuroma had formed and he didn’t have insurance\n\n\nHe called Alton weeks after he had a simple closure done and told him that he couldn’t feel his finger and couldn’t play\nHe used his air miles to fly to New York and Alton fixed it\n\nAlton knew the surgery center and anesthesiologist and called in a favor (they didn’t charge him)\nNow he’s fine\n\n\nThis was Alton’s patient zero and his aha moment\nHe has been lucky enough to treat a lot of other musicians\n\nHow the nonprofit got started \n\nOne day Elvis Costello and Diana Krall were in and he told them he was thinking about doing this officially and asked if they could help in some way (perhaps use their names)  \nThey got IRS nonprofit status in 2017 and then Elvis said, “I’m going to do the first concert. I love the Paramount Theater in Austin. Let’s do it in Austin. I’ll do a two hour solo show.”\n\nThey raised about a quarter of a million dollars\nThat was the seed money and people came pouring in\n\n\nHere in Austin, HAAM (the Health Alliance for Austin Musicians) is a big organization that does so much and for so long, but they don’t provide the actual care\n\nThey were struggling to get specialists to actually discount their care or provide the care\nAnd orthopedically speaking, not having your upper limb, your shoulder, elbow or hand, you can’t make music\n\n\n\nThe physical demands of playing a violin or the drums \nWhat are the types of injuries that high level musicians come in with? \n\nMusicians are people too, so they do all the stupid things that we all do to injure ourselves (that’s a separate category)\n\nThey can’t necessarily take the same rest when they’ve injured something\nThey have to be 100%\n\n\nIf you’re a violinist in the Philharmonic, there are 15 other highest level musicians waiting in the ranks for the opportunity to sit in your seat, your chair on the stage\nAlton points out one aspect of this, “I can do surgery with probably three fingers, but if you can’t flex down your index finger or whatever on the fret, then you can’t make the music.”\nThey’re not trying to jump higher, hit the ball farther, drive the car faster, all the different ways that athletes are trying to do to maximize their output\nThey are submaximal athletes, but it’s repetitious\nIn a standard NFL game, there are about 35 passes\nIn a typical Mozart violin concerto, it’s 20,000 bow strokes \nAnd they do that repeatedly over and over and over again\nA lot of these are very unnatural positions\n\nThink about violinists, they need their hands, they’re shoulders, they are abducted, they are externally rotated\nTheir other one is up in the impingement zone \nThey’re living 8 hours a day doing this\nThat is terrible for the shoulder\n\n\nThink of the drummers\n\nHigh hats and every which way they’re going and going massively for 3 hours straight\nIt’s just uncanny that they even survive\n\n\nIt’s very different from athletes\n\nAlton remarks, “I don’t even know how many passes Tom Brady has thrown in his career, but it’s not that huge of a number”\n\n\n\nWork at the Musician Treatment Foundation (MTF) \n\nThey were flooded with patients initially\nThere was this backlog of patients who hadn’t played for 6-9 months\n\nThey were just fallow, they were trying to get odd jobs, they couldn’t take gigs\n\n\nAlton’s very first patient (Jennifer Jackson) is a great singer songwriter in Austin and tours around\n\nShe had bilateral full thickness rotator cuff tears\nShe had already gone to try to see somebody, and it was going to cost her $10,000 or more\nShe had some very minimal insurance\nWhen Alton told her it wasn’t going to cost her anything to fix this, she just started crying\n\n\nIn 5+ years now they’ve provided over $2 million in free care to under and uninsured professional musicians\nThey’ve probably treated around 50 musicians\n\nAnd that doesn’t include the ones he’s been discounting\nThese are the one s they actually funneled through MTF\n\n\nThey’ve had 100’s of non-operative musicians, it’s mind boggling\n\nThese are just as bad\nOften a cortisone shot makes them better\n\n\nThey have an upcoming concert in December with Elvis, Roseanne Cash, John Leventhal, a bunch of great people\nAlton has been able to recruit over 60 colleagues who he knows and trusts\n\nThey have the same ethic, they want to give back\nThey are shoulder, elbow and hand surgeons at the best places around the country\n\n\nIn December they are launching P For M (Physicians for Musicians Network)\n\nUp until now, Alton had provided all the care but they they’re going to help provide the care \nThey have 60 surgeons signed on now\n\n\nBefore they were limited because Alton was the only surgeon\nPeter notes they need more dollars to help cover the other costs\n\nPhysicians waive their fee\nThey need to use the nonprofit resources to fun the surgeon centers and anesthesia fees\n\n\nThey’ve been unsuccessful in getting any anesthesiologists who are musicians as well, but are hopeful they will once they get the right momentum\nMost surgeons (Alton included) have some participation or partial ownership of a surgery center\nHis surgery center in Austin costs 1/10 of Medicare\nSo their biggest cost by far is the anesthesia\n\nAlton’s vision for the Musician Treatment Foundation \n\nPeter notes that every year their fundraiser gets bigger and more incredible\n\nIt’s a huge concert gala\n\n\n\nWhat types of fundraising go on outside of that each year? \n\nAlton is kind of a one-man fundraising machine because of all of his generous patients\nThey are applying for grants and starting to get some\nOrganizations that provide community grants and so forth are right in the thick of communities because it holds communities together\n\nIt develops relationships that weren’t there before\nAnd it’s all ages\n\n\n\n \nGratitude and rucking [3:34:15]\n\nAlton practices in 2 cities\n\nMonday and Friday he sees patients at his clinic in Austin\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, he’s in New York City\n\n\nPeter is grateful that he’s had the privilege of seeing him in both cities\n\nAnd has sent patients to him in both cities\n\n\nThe gratitude is likewise; Peter mentioned rucking at one of their mini meetings and Alton loves it\n\nHe’s carrying 35 pounds\nHe does run rucking because he loves running\nHe’s only been rucking for about 3 months, 2-3 times a week, but it’s changed his body\n\nHe feels lighter, stronger, better\n\n\nIt’s been a game changer for him\n\n\n\n§\nPHOTOS FROM PETER’S SURGERY\n<img
