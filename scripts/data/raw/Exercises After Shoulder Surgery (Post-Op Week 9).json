  "content": "As many of you know, I had shoulder surgery in March 2022. I was recently given clearance to expand my range of motion. I thought it would be helpful to film my entire week 9 post-op PT session with Kyler Brown where we walk through 11 shoulder exercises. Remember, these exercises are great even if you’re not recovering from surgery!\n<iframe title=\"Exercises After Shoulder Surgery (Post-Op Week 9) | Peter Attia, M.D. &amp; Kyler Brown, D.C.\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f6EuItnZNQE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nIn this video, we discuss:\n\n00:00 – Introduction\n05:15 – Isometric Shoulder Extension\n05:47 – Isometric Shoulder Flexion\n06:30 – Isometric Shoulder External Rotation\n08:33 – Assisted Flexion/Supination with Core Activation and Diaphragmatic Breathing\n09:59 – Ipsilateral Rotation With Banded Hip and Shoulder Facilitation\n13:23 – Bilateral Banded External Rotation (3 hand positions)\n15:38 – Kickstand RDL with External Rotation Isometric the Shoulder\n17:28 – Reverse Lunge with Isometric Row\n18:40 – Isometric Cuff walk-outs (Increases load tolerance without motion to the joint)\n20:35 – Rotator Cuff Eccentrics\n22:20 – Rotator Cuff Eccentric with Drop sets"
