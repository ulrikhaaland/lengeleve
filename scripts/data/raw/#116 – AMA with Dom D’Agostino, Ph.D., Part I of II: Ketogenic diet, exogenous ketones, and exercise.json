the laboratory science into human applications\nProjects:\nNASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations research\n\nDom was a crew member for NEEMO 22\nHis wife was a crew member for NEEMO 23\nThis project is evaluating the effects of hyperbaric environments, extreme environments on human physiology\nThey now have an IRB protocol for cognitive function, body composition, gut microbiome, sleep, heart rate variability, and stress\n\nEffects of ketones on cancer cachexia\n\nThey are looking at the effects of ketones on mitigating cancer cachexia and wasting associated with metastatic cancer \nDom just published a manuscript \n\nMetabolic therapies for various genetic diseases \n\nExample being Kabuki syndrome\nThey are developing ketone metabolic therapies as a means to treat these diseases not only from a metabolic perspective, but as a means to influence epigenetic pathways that may be used to treat the disease\nKetones may be a form of metabolic “epigenetic therapy” for genetic disorders like Kabuki syndrome \n\nBenefits of a ketogenic diet for an otherwise healthy person [7:00]\nIntermittent ketosis\n\nThe main benefit is that it promotes metabolic flexibility\nMost people are adapted to frequent carbohydrate feedings\nAnd they are not adapted to using fat as a major energy source during times of limited carbohydrate availability or calorie availability during periods of fasting\nKetosis (and/or fasting) activates a genetic program that allows you to burn fat and make ketones more efficiently\nIt may take some time, but you have an innate ability to be metabolically flexible, so the more you do intermittent ketosis (or fasting), the more benefits you derive from it over time\n\nGlucose-ketone index and insulin suppression\n⇒ The glucose ketone index calculator: a simple tool to monitor therapeutic efficacy for metabolic management of brain cancer\n\nThe thing to target would be the glucose-ketone index\n\nFor example, you could restrict calories by 50% on a ketogenic diet and do that for six days a month and achieve, a glucose-ketone index between 1 and 2\n\n\nInsulin suppression also occurs\nDoing a restricted ketogenic diet combined that with time-restricted feeding, you’re hitting all the major drivers of the benefits that you’d get from fasting such as:\n\nsuppressed mTOR\nsuppressed insulin\nIt’s also probably stimulating autophagy\n\n\n\n*Suggestion from Dom: Once a month, try to do 5-7 days of a ketogenic diet restricting calories by 50%\nBook recommendations for getting knowledgeable on the ketogenic diet [11:30]\n\nGeneral info: The Ketogenic Bible—comprehensive overview of the ketogenic diet and recipes \nFor the athlete: The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Performance by Jeff Volek and Stephen Phinney – “book that really influenced me”\nFor the layman: Keto Answers—great book for the layman, defines modified ketogenic diet, recipes, tips, troubleshooting, etc.\nClinical info: \n\nKetogenic Diet and Metabolic Therapies—for listeners that are interested in the science\nThe Ketogenic and Modified Atkins Diets, 6th Edition: Treatments for Epilepsy and Other Disorders by Dr. Eric Kossoff – for those interested in a modified ketogenic approach from a clinical perspective\n\n\nFor Alzheimer’s: Complete Book of Ketones\n\nBest devices for measuring ketones [13:45]\nUrine tests\n\nThe Siemens Multistix SG\n\nPretty good for a “yes or no” if you’re in ketosis\n\n\n\nBlood tests\n\nPrecision Xtra\n\nwell validated, very reliable\nmay be measuring slightly lower than an official lab test\n\n\nKeto-Mojo\n\nDom likes this one because it includes GKI (glucose-ketone index)\nStrips are less expensive\nKeto-Mojo may be measuring slightly higher when in the low ranges\n\n\nNote: When ketones get into the 2 to 3 range, the Precision Xtra and the Keto-Mojo will correlate\n\nBreath acetone testing\n\nBioSense Breath Ketone Analyzer \n\n“the most quantitative breath meter”\nIt’s “exceptionally good” and correlates well with BHB when in a fasted state\nBut if you have alcohol, a meal prior, or even chewing gum prior to the test it will not be accurate\nDom says this is his second favorite way to measure ketones after measuring blood\nBreath acetone is a very strong indicator of fat oxidation \nThe acetone is “basically derived from fat”\n\n\n\n–What’s happening when you’re measuring acetone?\n\nWhen in ketosis, you have beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood \nAnd as BHB rises, so does acetoacetate (ratio is about 4 to 1)\nAcetoacetate can then spontaneously decarboxylate into acetone \nNote: when you’re “using” ketones, then your acetone would go down\n\nFor example, exercise:\n\nExercise can really lower my acetone level breath ketone as it does with blood beta-hydroxybutyrate\nBut when you are at rest, levels will come back up because you’ve ramped up \n\nMetabolism\nfat oxidation\nKetogenesis\nand you start building up ketones, but you’re not using them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Cahill’s 40-day fasting experiment\n–Interesting takeaways:\n\nGlucose was relatively stable throughout\nIV infusion of 20 IU’s of insulin caused fatty acids and ketones in the blood to go sharply down\n\nIn other words, ketogenesis and fat mobilization for fuel is really a function of insulin suppression\n\n\nThis has implications in regards to exogenous ketones\n\nDoes exogenous ketones elevate insulin? \nIf yes, will it then decrease your own endogenous ketone production?\n\nDom says exogenous ketones have many therapeutic applications\nSo it’s really important to understand what’s going on in the liver, in the muscle, and in the brain when delivering exogenous ketones\nDom’s been focusing on that question in himself and in the lab\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic factors that influence how someone responds to the ketogenic diet [24:45]\nHow an individual responds to a ketogenic diet and/or fasting can depend on certain genetic factors\n\nSome people don’t adapt as well as others to keto diets/fasting\nAnd by “adapt”, Dom means they don’t adapt well to an insulin suppression state that would allow access to the body’s fuel stores in terms of fatty acid mobilization and ketogenesis\n\nFactors include…\n\nBeta-oxidation defects affect some people\nThere are about 30+ different enzymes that can be potentially affected by a wide range of genetic diseases or SNPs\nA class of enzymes called ACADs such as MCAD, LCAD, and VLCAD and those are disorders of not being able to metabolize medium chain fatty acids\nCPT1 and CPT2 deficiency\n\nHormone-sensitive lipase\n\nIt’s is induced by fasting and by the catecholamines that are released by fasting\nStimulation of beta-1 adrenergic receptor and beta-2 adrenergic receptor activates hormone sensitive lipase\nThat’s why things like Beta-adrenergic agonist like Ephedrine or Clenbuterol are very powerful fat burning agents.\nPeople who poorly adapt to a ketogenic diet and/or fasting may have lower sensitivity—meaning their hormone sensitive lipase is not activated by catecholamines as robustly as other people \n\nLipoprotein lipase—another thing to look at\n\nLow insulin with high glucagon would stimulate that. \nIn some people it’s very robust and in other people it’s not. \nAnd I think this is one of the biomarkers that we need to look at for people that adapt well to a ketogenic diet.\n\nBeta-ketothiolase deficiency—a genetic disease where you cannot make ketones\n\nThat person would need to eat frequent meals\nAnd if those people are subjected to fasting or even carbohydrate restriction, they become \n\nExtremely tired\nHypoglycemic, and\nHave seizures \n\n\n\nKetogenic diet for those with the APOE e4 allele [28:15]\nFor someone who has two copies of APOE e4, what do they need to think about or do differently when it comes to the ketogenic diet?\nFirst, Dom mentions a couple resources:\n\nDr. Dale Bredesen has influenced his thinking in this area\nDr. Mary Newport as well\n\nShe wrote a book about using ketones as a therapy for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)\nShe also has a book about her husbands battle with AD\n\n\n\nDom’s take:\n\nIf you have one APOE e4 (and especially if you have two) the main thing to do is manage glucose and insulin\n\n–Important things important to track:\n\nHemoglobin A1c is a really good indicator\nTriglycerides\nYour level of systemic inflammation using a high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) test\nYou want these to all be as low as possible: glucose, hemoglobin A1C, triglycerides, insulin, hs-CRP\nDom’s uses this at-home test: ZRT Labs CardioMetabolic Test Kit \n\n–Another important metric: Blood pressure\n\nHigh blood pressure correlates with poor outcomes if you’re APOE e4 positive\n\nHigh LDL when on a ketogenic diet\n\nSome people experience are huge spike in LDL when on a keto diet\nIf that is the case, a few suggestions would be…\n\nLimit saturated fat\nMaybe take a low dose of a statin (a half a pill two times per week, like on Monday, Thursday)\nRather than ketogenic, modify the diet to be higher protein, moderate fat, low carb diet may be with the fat source coming in the majority form of monounsaturated fat\n\n\n\nSleep and exercise \n\nBoth are important for prevention of Alzheimer’s disease, says Dom\nSleep might be most important for people with one or two copies of APOE e4 because it’s preventing amyloid accumulation and we know that the glymphatic system helps to clear out some of the toxins and amyloid accumulation as we age\n\nImpact of long-term ketogenic diets on thyroid function [34:25]\nLong-term keto diets and thyroid function\n\nDom has observed that some people see an see increase in their reverse T3 when on a keto diet (as well as when intermittent fasting)\nSuppression of insulin can contribute to an increase in reverse T3 (which could suppress thyroid function)\nA side effect of elevated reverse T3 is a decrease in body temperature and feeling cold\n\nWays to prevent this:\n\nDo not reduce calories too quickly\nWhen switching to a low carb diet, don’t eliminate all carbs immediately\nIf you’re doing a calorie restricted ketogenic diet, you might do a “refeed” every 3 to 4 days where you just eat a higher volume of keto-friendly foods \n\nThis would activate pathways that would prevent an increase in reverse T3 \nIt also could allow your metabolism to keep cranking and prevent a slowing of metabolism commonly seen with long term calorie restriction\n\n\nCertain micronutrients can help with maintaining thyroid function on a ketogenic diet\n\nHigh selenium and high iodine foods (salt) are important\nDom’s favorites are sardines, liver, and Brazilian nuts \n\n\n\nDom also points out that the some people have high reverse T3 even when not calorie restricted\n\nWhich implies that the thyroid issue may have more to do with the suppression of insulin than it does the restriction of calories \nIt’s more common in women than men\nThis suppression of thyroid probably affects up to 40% of women, says Dom\nBut it’s hard to deconstruct what’s happening because some of them are over-exercising or calorie restricted or taking intermittent fasting a little too often. \nDom suggests doing these things intermittently rather than continuously\n“And your body adapts to that state if you’re doing it all the time, so I believe it’s important to use it intermittently.”\n\nLow-carb and ketogenic diets for appetite control and weight management [39:00]\nBob’s experience with the keto diet\n\nBob gained about 30 pounds in college\nFirst, he tried just eating less, moving more, and found himself hungry and tired all the time\nNext, he tried the Atkins diet (meat, fish, fowl, eggs, cheese, leafy green vegetables) with no restriction on volume\nHe was surprised at how he was never too hungry and never too full \nFor the first time he found himself almost “forgetting to eat” at times\nThe keto diet lowers insulin and glucose to a point that allows you to then use your own body fat as fuel source (especially when you have fat to lose)\nIn a way, you’re not really calorie restricted—“I almost think of it as you’re eucaloric, but more of your calories are coming from within.”\nImportant: It might be better to give your body time to get into ketosis and/or adapt to using internal fat stores before dropping calories significantly\n\nDom on ketogenic diets for appetite control and weight management\n\nThe ketogenic diet allows you to control your appetite instead of your appetite controlling you\nDieting by cutting calories but still eating refined carbs can lead to people becoming “neurotic about food” and can produce really disastrous and damaging eating behaviors\nLow carb eating (not necessarily ketogenic) can really help to attenuate a lot of those cravings and is better for weight control in Dom’s opinion\n\n“If you restore insulin sensitivity. . .you’re better able to access and burn fat, so that becomes a key feature.”\nKetogenic diet and the microbiome [43:00]\nWhat’s the long-term impact of a ketogenic diet on the microbiome? \nHow to maintain proper gut motility, microbiome diversity on a ketogenic diet?\nThe ketogenic diet and the microbiome\n\nSome people respond very well clinically with a carnivore diet, i.e., no soluble fiber or “fuel” for your intestinal bacteria \nBut fiber does have an important role in the microbiome\nAfter eaten, soluble fiber breaks down to short-chain fatty acids (butyrates, acetate, propionate) \nThe colonocytes (epithelial cell of the colon) then use that for fuel\nButyrates are also an epigenetic regulator in the form of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor\nAcetate and propionate also play an important role so that microbiome diversity is key\n\nDom’s take:\n\nFor Dom, personally, getting some amount of fiber is important\nThat being said, Dom says some people respond very well clinically to a diet that’s completely devoid of carbohydrates, such as in the case of those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)\nBut generally, he would not recommend to completely eliminate fiber all the time\nHaving some amount of fiber in the diet promotes microbiome diversity\nBut it doesn’t necessarily all have to come from plant foods\nYou can get probiotics from fermented foods, like sour cream with cultures, or yogurt with certain cultures \nBut prebiotic fiber is really important for the long term, says Dom\n\n“Some prebiotic fiber is really important long term for gut motility, microbiome diversity, and just for the overall microbiome.”\nComparing monounsaturated fat versus saturated fat on the ketogenic diet [45:55]\n\nWhen first going onto a keto diet, he was following a mainly dairy fat based ketogenic diet and he noticed a skyrocketing of LDL\nHis triglycerides were also pretty high\nDom notes that he still eats a very high level of saturated fat\nHowever, he has made an effort to add more monounsaturated fats\nAnd that transition from saturated fat to more monounsaturated fat has given him a more favorable lipid profile\nSo for those seeing “abnormalities” in their lipid profile, that would be something Dom recommends\nDom’s approach is to simply limit his saturated fat intake to under 100 grams of saturated fat for one or two days a week\n\nWhat about polyunsaturated fat?\n\nAdmittedly, he doesn’t pay a whole lot of attention to PUFA\nHe mainly just focuses on getting a lot of omega-3\nHis omega-3 to omega-6 ratio is probably about 2:1 \nHe eats a lot of fish which brings up his omega-3 intake\nHe also takes an omega-3 supplement especially on days when not eating fish\n\nImplications of long-term genetic and epigenetic adaptations to a ketogenic diet [47:45]\n\nA lot of unknowns on this topic\nThat said, there are clearly some epigenetic modifications going on with a long-term ketogenic diet which may have implications as it relates to genetic diseases\n\nFor example, there is likely some activation of a genetic program to stimulate a wide range of fatty acid oxidation enzymes like hormone-sensitive lipase\n\n\n\nThe following indicators suggest that when on a keto diet you’re really activating epigenetic programs that are shifting your metabolism away from glycolytic to more fatty acid oxidation, ketogenic, ketogenesis, ketolysis, and ketone transport:\n\nAccelerating beta oxidation\nKetogenesis is likely upregulated over time\nKetolysis (breaking ketones down for energy in the mitochondria to make ATP) is upregulated\nKetone transport via the monocarboxylic acid transporters is upregulated over time\nIncrease in the proteins that are transcriptional translation of proteins that are associated with the MCTs\n\n⇒ Study showing ketones may be a form of metabolic “epigenetic therapy” for genetic disorders like Kabuki syndrome \nThe next frontier of research into a long-term keto diet\nDom’s really interested in specific genes that are impacting… \n\nOncogenic transformation \nNeuroprotection\nAmyloid degenerative processes associated with dopaminergic neurons degenerating\n\nWhy some people see a rise in LDL-C and LDL-P when on a ketogenic diet and what they can do about it [50:15]\nMechanism by which LDL seems to skyrocket in certain people on a keto diet\n\nDom admits this is a confusing topic which needs to be further investigated\n\n–What you can do about it:\n\nFor Dom, he drops his saturated fat intake down to below 100 grams for a few days a week\nFor others, saturated fat might need to be dropped to close to 25 grams per day \n\nThe important role of LDL particles (LDL-P):\n\nIt’s an important transport molecule for things like triglycerides and phospholipids\nIt also aids in growth and repair\n\nCurious cases of high and low LDL\n\nIn the case of athletes…\n\nThey tend to have a higher LDL when on keto because there’s a lot of turnover associated with the breakdown of protein and tissue, especially with hard training\n\n\nIn cancer patients…\n\nDom has observed that cancer patients have a remarkably low LDL which is correlated with a high tumor burden\nSome indication that having a low LDL predisposes you to cancer\n\nInitial thought was that it was because of some of the statins being used\nBut recent reports suggest that it’s independent of statins\n\n\n⇒ Science Daily: Low LDL cholesterol is related to cancer risk \n\n\n\nWhat does LDL rise dramatically for some people?\n\nDom says the reason for the skyrocketing LDL in the body is still unclear\nDave Feldman (previous podcast guest) has a hypothesis that he refers to as lean mass hyper-responders\n\nDue to higher trafficking of fatty acids through VLDL secretion, the VLDLs are getting pumped out by the liver and they’re delivering triglycerides\nThe lean person doesn’t have a lot of adipose to draw from\nAnd so there’s just really a lot of turnover of the VLDLs in the liver\nThe VLDLs then become LDLs, so essentially they’re remnants of those VLDLs, and they stick around a lot longer in the blood\nSo if you look in someone’s bloodstream, they’re going to show up with an elevated LDL cholesterol or LDL particle number as well in particular.\n\n\n\n⇒ Phinney and Volek’s paper: Paradox of Hypercholesterolaemia in Highly Trained, Keto-Adapted Athletes \nBut does a high LDL-p even matter when other markers improve?\n\nDom is partly convinced that it’s not something to be really concerned about if it’s independently elevated\nEspecially when arguably more important biomarkers are unaffected or even improved with a ketogenic diet, such as:\n\ntriglycerides down\nHDL the same or slightly elevated\n inflammation down\ninsulin down\n\n\nFurthermore, it’s pretty common that in the first three months of a keto diet the LDL numbers will go up only to come down and normalize later on\n\n“There just needs to be more research on this, but I’m not particularly concerned that the LDL is atherogenic.”\nShould someone with familial hypercholesterolemia consider the ketogenic diet? [55:00]\nThe keto diet is “worth considering” for someone with FH, but Dom has some important advice:\n*These tips are especially important for someone over 70 years old*\n\n1) Don’t transition from high carb directly to a ketogenic diet\n\nInstead, cut carbs over the course of 2 to 3 weeks \n\n\n2) Comprehensive blood work should be done to indicate normal liver function, kidney function, etc.\n3) Consider working with a ketogenic dietician (At least for the first week or so)\n\nThere’s a lot of trial and error with the ketogenic diet and you can really improve the learning curve\nYou can find a list of dieticians on KetoNutrition.org\n\n\n\n⇒ Dom’s new study: Metabolic Switching Is Impaired by Aging and Facilitated by Ketosis Independent of Glycogen \nMore resources:\n\nArt De Vany is in his 70s and he’s doing well on an approach of fitness training while on a keto diet plus intermittent fasting\nDom recommends the IHMC podcast episodes with Art De Vany:\n\nEPISODE 30: ART DE VANY TALKS ABOUT HOLLYWOOD ECONOMICS, THE PALEO WAY, AND THE ROLE OF FITNESS AND DIET IN AGING\nEPISODE 105: ART DE VANY TALKS ABOUT HEALTHSPAN, LIFESPAN AND HEALING THE WOUNDS OF AGING\n\n\n\nExogenous ketones—benefits, therapeutic uses, and ketone supplements that Dom has tested [56:45] \nWhat are some potential benefits from taking exogenous ketones?\nStill many unknowns, but benefits are likely very numerous for different medical conditions:\n\nSeizures\nMetabolic disorders are very responsive\nGlucose metabolism disorders, for example, where the ketones function as alternative energy substrates\nRange of neurological disorders where the underlying etiology is associated with glucose hypometabolism and/or neuroinflammation\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI)\nEnhanced wound healing\nMetabolic management of cancer\nAppetite suppression for weight loss\n\n-Traumatic brain injury (TBI)\n\nThis could be an example of neuroinflammation\nWith TBI comes a decoupling of metabolism as it relates to pyruvate dehydrogenase function, so a decrease in PDH function and overall PDH levels\nThe glucose transporter in neurons tends to be internalized when you have a brain injury or neuroinflammation\nAnd ketone bodies would bypass that and help to restore and preserve brain energy metabolism\n\n-Wound healing \n\nDr. Shannon Kesl did work showing that adding exogenous ketones to a standard diet of high carbohydrates enhances wound healing (in an ischemic model of wound healing)\nBut it also happened in younger animals too with trends for enhanced wound healing (work yet to be published)\n\n–The glucose lowering effect of ketones\n\nDom calls this the most important observation\nConsuming exogenous ketones can lower glucose and help people achieve a GKI that we know could be therapeutic\n\nThat has implications for the metabolic management of cancer\nAlso helpful in terms of appetite suppression for those needing to lose weight\n\nA lack of appetite is associated with just an elevation of ketones\n\n\n\n\n\nExogenous ketones in the form of ketone salts\n\nA ketone salt is the most common form of exogenous ketones \n\n(Another form is ketone esters)\n\n\nA ketone salt is when beta hydroxybutyrate is combined ionically with an electrolyte such as sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium\nThey are ingested orally\nTypically get your BHB levels in the range of one to two millimolar of D-β-hydroxybutyrate\nMany of the products out there are racemic, so they include both D-β-hydroxybutyrate and L-β-hydroxybutyrate and\n*Important Note: Ketone meters only read the amount of the “D” enantiomer\n\nSo, if you took a racemic ketone mixture and you see 2.0 millimolar of D beta-hydroxybutyrate on the meter, your total beta hydroxybutyrate are likely 4.0 millimolar\n\n\nDom suggests targeting a BHB level between 1.0-2.0\nMany suggest going as high as 2.0-5.0, but Dom calls that unphysiological ⇒ “I think that it’s an extra amount of energy that the body has to do something with. I believe you’re spending resources to eliminate that energy in the body and they could probably do bad things.”\n\nBenefits of exogenous ketones:\n\nFrom an everyday perspective, they can be a good source of energy\nStimulating a mild state of ketosis with exogenous ketones may be turning on genes and having signaling effects that are promoting a healthier metabolic state over time \nMany researchers in this field adamantly believe that beta hydroxybutyrate is a pretty potent longevity molecule\n\nDom says he’s “waiting for the science” on that claim\nHowever, if using exogenous ketones to optimize and preserve metabolic health then that can contribute to longevity \n\n\n\nDifferent functions of the D-β-hydroxybutyrate and L-β-hydroxybutyrate\n\nA pure D beta-hydroxybutyrate ester was not very efficacious against oxygen toxicity seizures\nThe most robust effect in preventing oxygen toxicity seizures is a molecule that elevated D and L beta-hydroxybutyrate in the blood, and also acetoacetate all at the same level\nAcetoacetate has a remarkable anti-convulsive effect\n\n–If you consume a racemic mixture of beta hydroxybutyrate…\n\nThe D form gets metabolized and used in skeletal muscle more efficiently, i.e., it’s generating more ATP resulting in greater metabolic efficiency\nWhereas he L beta-hydroxybutyrate sticks around in tissues longer and has beneficial signaling effects such as…\nSuppression of the NLRP-3 inflammasome\nHistone deacetylase activity\nIt may also activate different receptors that have anti-inflammatory effects (e.g., GPR109A receptor)\n\n–In summary, \n\nL-beta-hydroxybutyrate is more therapeutic… it could be a drug-like molecule that’s a drug that’s derived from an endogenously made molecule, but you’re delivering it and having drug-like effects\nThe D form may be more appropriate for an an athlete\n\n***\nList of ketone products that Dom has tested: KetoNutrition.org/ketones\nDom’s recent review article: History and Rationale for Ketone Esters and Metabolic Alternatives.\nInteresting study in Lancet using Ketone Salts: D,L-3-hydroxybutyrate treatment of multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD)\nKetogenic protocols for management of traumatic brain injuries [1:06:00]\nIn the case of a traumatic brain injury…\n\n80% of people with penetrating traumatic brain injuries have seizures\nTo prevent seizures, the ketogenic diet makes sense, but it’s hard to implement says Dom\nA more sustainable concept would be a low carb diet with supplemental ketones (esters or salts)\nThe goal would be to achieve a glucose ketone index of 1.0 to 2.0\n\nThis would lower inflammation\nAnd provide an alternative energy source to the brain\n\n\n\nShould you dose someone with ketones immediately after the injury?\n\nI don’t know the answer to that question, says Dom\nHowever, it might be prudent to do so in a way that’s not shooting ketones up to like five or six millimolar, but I think a mild state of ketosis anywhere between one to three millimolar would be beneficial\n\nLong term management of TBI\nSalt or ester?\n\nThe easiest way to do that is with a ketone ester\nHowever, a ketone salt is more efficacious therapeutically\n\nSalts plus MCTs\n\nDom says that the best approach is to mix the ketone salt with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT oil or MCT oil powder) in one-to-one combination\nExogenous ketones provides immediate substrate and the MCT molecule is stimulating ketones to be made in the liver\nWhereas if you bolus ketone salts, you could be potentially reducing hepatic ketone production\n\nComparing the benefits and therapeutic uses of various medium-chain fatty acids—caprylic acid (C8), capric acid (C10), MCT oil, and coconut oil [1:08:45]\nCaprylic acid vs. capric acid\n\nCaprylic acid (aka C8, aka octanoic acid) is more ketogenic than capric acid (aka C10, aka decanoic acid)\nIn self experiments, Dom sees about 20% more of an increase in ketones with C8 vs C10\nBut C10 may have anti-seizure benefits outside of the ketone production\n\nMCTs\n\nMedium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are not metabolized like long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) \nLCFA are packaged into chylomicrons and absorbed in the lacteal glands before getting into circulation\nMCTs, on the other hand, go right to the liver by a hepatic portal circulation and stimulates beta oxidation of fatty acids very robustly\nNot only do you get a burst of ketones entering circulation, but the MCTs also enter circulation and MCTs can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB)\nIn terms of energy for the brain, the C8 would offer a bigger advantage than C10\nHowever, C10 may have independent advantages in addition to being able to cross the BBB\nDom recommends just going with the cheaper MCT oil (he like the NOW brand)\n\nCoconut oil\n-What’s the makeup of coconut oil in terms of C8, C10, etc.?\n\nDepending on the coconut oil, about 20% to 30% MCTs\n\n-Lauric acid\n\nCoconut oil has lauric acid which may have immune boosting effects\nLauric acid encapsulates and surrounds viruses and can have antiviral effects\nDom says he’s “relatively convinced that the science is there”\nThat would give credence to the idea that the coconut oil should ALSO be delivered with the MCT\n\n-Mary Newport’s book mentioned she was giving her husband a lot of coconut oil\n\nShe gave her husband coconut oil and documented an improvement in a well-established test for Alzheimer’s disease (the clock drawing test, and the Mini-Mental Status Exam)\nPlus, he has an acute improvement in just the matter of a day or two\nDom had dinner with Mary Newport and her husband 10 years ago \n\nHe watched her husband consume a vial of MCT plus coconut oil and saw his tremors to slow down as well as his facial expressions become more animated\n\n\nDom says that Steven was evidence that there are people that are responsive to a metabolic intervention\nDom estimates about 30% to 50% of people are fairly responsive to a metabolic intervention\n\nKetone esters\n\nKetone esters are 10 times more potent than coconut oil\nDom says we need to direct research funding into evaluating ketone esters as a potential therapy, not only for Alzheimer’s disease, but for a wide range of neurological diseases\n\nBrain energy metabolism \n\nDr. Stephen Cunnane is spearheading research into imaging brain energy metabolism\nInstead of a FDG-PET, they can essentially look at ketone metabolism via a dual PET imaging to look at glucose versus ketone metabolism\n\n⇒ Study by Stephen Cunnane: Ketogenic Medium Chain Triglycerides Increase Brain Energy Metabolism in Alzheimer’s Disease \n-The bottom line is this…\n\nGlucose hypometabolism is a very well established hallmark of aging in the brain\nHowever, while glucose metabolism decreases with age, ketone metabolism stays relatively elevated \nThe implications are that a ketogenic metabolic therapy in the form of a ketone ester or just MCTs would be more efficacious as a means to energize the brain than a sugar based metabolism or sugar based intervention\nA lot of this research has been spurred by Mary Newport’s books:\n\nAlzheimer’s Disease: What If There Was a Cure?\nThe Complete Book of Ketones\n\n\n\nNootropics, caffeine, and other stimulants [1:16:15]\nCaffeine\n\nDom uses caffeine to enhance motivation and performance\nHowever, he acknowledges people can become addicted or habituated to caffeine \nDom recently listened to Michael Pollan’s audiobook, Caffeine\n\nThis idea that we wake up with caffeine withdrawal and we go for coffee basically to relieve caffeine withdrawal symptoms over time\n\n\nHow Dom uses it…\n\nHe likes the buzz from caffeine for a mild boost in motivation\nHe makes sure to stop consuming it around noon\nFor him, the “coming down” from caffeine actually facilitates sleep\n\n\n\n-Caffeine and ketones and brain energy\n\nSteven Cunnane demonstrated that when you administer caffeine with MCTs, you convert more of those MCTs to ketones\nMCT oil becomes more ketogenic when you consume it with caffeine because it stimulates the beta oxidation of fats\nIf you deliver caffeine with ketones, there’s a synergy that results in enhanced brain energy metabolism\n\nEphedrine\n\nEphedrine is very powerful stimulant \nIt can also stimulate ketogenesis\n\nIn a fasted state, taking a beta receptor agonist, which activates hormone-sensitive lipase, you can really boost your ketone levels\n\n\n\nModafinil\n\nModafinil is a drug that Dom uses very sparingly as a mild nootropic\nParticularly when he is sleep deprived and has to drive or work against a deadline\nHe generally takes only 50 milligrams\nThe dose usually comes in 200 milligram tablets\nDom gets splitting headaches when taking 100 mg or more at a time\nBut 50 mg combined with a cup of coffee provides a noticeable effect\n\n–More about modafinil\n\nIt’s a fairly moderate stimulant\nIt has amphetamine like effects, but it doesn’t trigger a pulse of dopamine like amphetamine \nThis is important because it doesn’t really have addictive properties like amphetamine\nThe literature also showed that you don’t habituate to it… meaning you can use it continuously use the same dose and you’ll get the same benefit\nThe military uses it as a “go pill” for combat readiness or in the case of a pilot needing to stay alert for long durations \nFor more on modafinil see previous episode of The Drive: AMA #4, AMA #7 \n\n–How does modafinil work mechanistically?\n\nStill unclear\nBut Dom speculates that it’s probably…\n\nThrough catecholamines (e.g., dopamine)\nMaybe also through anti-gaba effects\nIt may be enhancing glutamatergic neurotransmitter activation or receptors, so maybe AMPA and NMDA receptor activation through glutamate \n\n\n\nTheanine and phenibut\n\nDom sometimes will take theanine or phenibut which is a phenylated GABA that is crossing the blood brain barrier\nDom calls it a mild CNS depressant where he feels less inhibited and the thoughts flow making him feel smarter and more creative\nSort of the opposite effect of a stimulant (which might cause too many neurons to fire and create analysis paralysis)\n\nSupplemental use of testosterone, DHEA, and creatine for muscle growth and performance [1:23:45]\nTestosterone\n\nTestosterone is an effective compound that will help grow muscle\nIf you are deficient in testosterone, Dom is in favor of supplementing with a doctor’s help\n“I think it’s more important to figure out why your testosterone would be low in the first place.”\n\nDHEA\n\nDehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a precursor that will break down into other hormones \nDom takes 25 milligrams of DHEA as a single dose upon waking up\nAn hour later, Dom will have a 20 or 25% increase in testosterone\nAnd if he stops taking the DHEA, his testosterone levels are normal suggesting that taking DHEA isn’t messing up his body’s ability to make testosterone on it’s own\nHowever, if you’re using DHEA multiple times throughout the day, you’ll probably quickly shut down your own testosterone\n\n-DHEA’s effect on cortisol\n\nWhen taking DHEA, Dom notices that his morning cortisol is slightly below normal\nSo the one thing that has changed is that my cortisol is slightly below normal. \nThe lower cortisol may be contributing to a lower glucose level as well\nCortisol is an important hormone… it’s good marker for your adaptation to training and progress with training, I think cortisol correlates highest with gains from training (per Layne Norton)\nHowever, a slightly lower level in the morning may not be a bad thing, says Dom\n\nCreatine\n\nCreatine has always been a staple for Dom\nHe takes it upon waking every morning\nFor Dom, it’s a noticeable effect in terms of his strength levels\nAnd also seems to give him a brain boost\nCreatine can also help in the case of a mild TBI—creatine can help restore brain energy metabolism and mitigate effects of a brain injury if you’re already taking it\nIdeal dosage\nDom says everyone could benefit from about 3 grams of creatine daily\n“It’s cheap. It’s effective. And it has a very, very good safety profile.”\n\nEffect on strength\n\nDom says he does a loading phase of about 10 g per day for a week\nThis will put on 2 or 3 lbs of body weight\nHe will also be able to get an extra 2 reps or so on certain lifts\n\nImpact of fasted-state training on strength and performance [1:30:15]\nDom’s 500 lb deadlift after a 7-day fast\n\nDom once fasted for 7 days and then deadlifted over 500 lbs (watch this clip from Joe Rogan)\nHe didn’t want to “push it” but felt like he could have done more\nMost people think your strength is going to tank when you go a couple of days without eating, but your body is very adaptable\n\nWhen does Dom feel strongest?\n\nDom feels strongest when fasted for about 8 to 16 hours as long as he’s well fed the days before\nHe tends to always get his PRs when he 8-16 hours fasted coming of 2 days of a calorie surplus\n\nPushing vs. pressing in a fasted state\n\n“I wouldn’t try benching because I do think you might be a little bit dehydrated from depleting glycogen.”\n“That cellular leverage you have when you’re in a fed state, it’s going to transfer to pressing exercises, whereas pulling exercises not so much.”\n“I do feel better, lighter on my feet, and my CNS can just fire and recruit more muscle, if I’m in that fasted or semi-fasted state doing things like squats and deadlifts. and pull ups, too.”\n\nStacking exogenous ketones with MCTs for optimal effectiveness [1:33:30]\nStacking for optimizing efficacy of ketones\n\nBHB and MCT is a stack that you’d want to use if you’re considering exogenous ketones\nKetones and/or MCT can be stacked with caffeine\n\n⇒ For a list of products Dom recommends click here \nResearch\n\nDom’s research into ketones has mostly been studying them in isolation\nHowever, they’re now doing more stacking of compounds together\n\nExample, taking a ketone ester, ketone salt, and then MCTs and then trying to determine what combinations would be best to deliver ketone metabolic therapy for…\n\nSeizures, and\nPerformance optimization/resilience especially in the context of the high pressure oxygen\n\n\n\n\n\nBCAA supplements during a fast for muscle preservation [1:35:45]\nThoughts on branched-chain amino acid (BCAAs) and essential amino acid (EAA) supplements\n\nDom used BCAAs for years and more recently was using EAAS\nHowever, he generally feels they unnecessary in most cases\n\nWhen they might be beneficial…\n\nThey may have benefit for people in a calorie restricted state\nAnd if you use them intra-workout\nSomeone who is a bit older (65+) may benefit because you become anabolic resistant with age\nSo for that person, Dom might suggest…\nTaking a BCAA-EAA mix upon waking and intra-workout (two scenarios where you’re in a catabolic state)\n\nTotal muscle mass is a function of protein breakdown and anabolic activity\nYou’re slowing muscle degradation and probably stimulating mTOR in skeletal muscle (if the leucine content is high enough)\nIn the context of training, mTOR stimulation in skeletal muscle is important and also may have anticancer effects\n\n\n\nOne experiment showed that in mice on the ketogenic diet, there was mTOR inhibition, but there was actually more activation of mTOR in the muscle\nIn short…\n\nSkeletal muscle mTOR activation=good. \nCancer tumor mTOR activation=bad. \n\nDom’s work sponsored by Scivation on BCAAs\n\nScivation is a company that we use BCAAs with a ketogenic diet\nHypothesis: There was the idea that driving mTOR with BCAAs would it fuel tumor growth\nThe study did NOT find tumor growth and actually found trends for the opposite\nThere were trends for an increase in survival time\nThere was a small advantage weight management and a preservation of body weight when the BCAAs was mixed with a keto diet\n\nAre BCAAs helpful for muscle preservation during prolonged fasting?\n\nDom says the results would be minimal, if any\nBCAAs also have calories, so it would be sort of like eating egg whites\n“You’d probably see an effect with skeletal muscle protein synthesis soon after you took it, but I think it kind of all balances out in time.”\nBob’s input: For someone with a ton of weight to lose, they might actually have the ability to break down excess skin for example into “essential” amino acids that can be reconstituted and used for preserving some muscle \n\nCurrent Supplements Dom uses: \n\nCreatine monohydrate \nAlpha Lipoic Acid \nCoQ10 \nMSM\nGlucosamine\nChondroitin \nMelatonin \n\nWhat app is Dom using for tracking his macros? [1:42:00]\nCarbon – Smart Diet Coach\n\nDom hasn’t done too much with macro tracking apps in the past\nBut recently he was trying out the Carbon – Smart Diet Coach app \nIt was developed by a natural bodybuilder named Layne Norton (friend of Dom’s)\nLayne wanted Dom to evaluate the ketogenic diet option\nDom says he really, really liked it\nIt’s quite simple, and the database is fantastic\n\nFor example, Dom uses KetoLogic products and those are loaded in there and pop right up\n\n\n\nDom’s observations about himself from using the app:\n\nHe realized he’s eating about 10-20% more calories than he estimated\nBut his weight has stayed the same after 8 days\nHis baseline calorie needs are really 4,000 per day\nWas also eating more carbs than he thought but he was still staying in ketosis\nDom recommends using the app if just for the learning experience \n\nGetting enough micronutrients while on a ketogenic diet [1:47:15]\nDom’s take on micronutrients\n\nHe doesn’t worry about it\nYou can get all the micronutrients you really need with foods like liver, fish, egg yolks, and sardines\nThere may be some benefits from plants, but “I don’t think it’s absolutely necessary”\n\nIdeal macros for staying in ketosis while getting enough protein for strength training [1:48:15]\nOverall thoughts:\n\nYour macro breakdown to remain in ketosis depends on the individual\nThe “lowest fat macro percent for staying ketosis” depends on your total calorie intake\n\nCarb intake\n\nOn high calorie days, Dom can be at 125 grams of carbs (a third being fiber) and stay in ketosis\nCarbs being 10-15% of this macros\nYet, his ketones are anywhere between 1.2 and 2.2 throughout the day\n\n*Dom’s tip: \n\nPay attention to how you feel and take notice of your ketone levels when you feel your best\nFor Dom, he’s found that being in the 1-1.5 mmol range is when he feels best\n\nFat intake\n\nDom gets about 400 grams of fat per day\n\nProtein intake\n\n120 g on the lowest days\n200 or more on the highest days \nUsually stays in the 1.5 grams per kilogram\nBut he likes to pulse his protein once or twice a week up  to 200 grams (approx. 2 g/kg of body weight) to help with recovery after some harder training days\n\nPros, cons, and ideal macros of one meal a day [1:51:15]\nCons\n\nHard to get all calorie and macro needs into one meal\nHowever, this approach might work for someone with lower calorie needs (~1,500)\nBut it would be difficult for an athlete\nDom says: “I could never maintain my weight, or strength, doing that day in and day out. I would have to eat an amount of food that I think would just not be optimal for a nutrient uptake, and I would tend to eat it later in the day, and I think that would disrupt my sleep.”\n\nIn terms of macros for that one meal…\n\nTake in lower protein if you’re not training hard, and boost your protein if you are training hard\nDom does do OMAD often but will every once in a while\nHis one meal might be a ribeye, fatty salad with olive oil and feta \n~80 grams of protein, ~100 grams of fat, and ~30 grams of fibrous carbohydrates, so about ~1500 calories\nHe might also sneak in his favorite keto chocolate mousse for dessert (on Dave Asprey podcast)\n“I could not really take in the calories and the macros that my body needs in that small eating window. So, that would be the major con.”\n\nPros\n\nIt’s a very effective way to produce a calorie deficit for those needing to lose weight\nDon’t have to do it daily, could try every other day or even just once a week\nA narrow eating window could also enhance insulin sensitivity\n\nDom’s take on “carb backloading” [1:54:45]\nDoes Dom do carb backloading?\n\nSort of… \nHe eats all his carbs right with dinner and after dinner snacks\nBut it’s mostly fibrous carbs, so it’s like “slow-carb backloading”\n\nAdvantages to keeping SOME carbohydrates in the diet\n\nTaking in 50 to 100 grams of carbs per day of slow-burning carbohydrates is enough to aid in repair (especially if you’re working out)\nIt will also prevent you from completely suppressing pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH)\nIt will allow you to keep insulin sensitivity high with keeping the PDH pathway open\nFor Dom, carbs consists of \n\nfibrous carbs, \navocado, \nfruits like blueberries, grapefruits, nectarine \nNuts\nDark chocolate (which he has every night)\nFor Dom, that ends up at 70 to 100 grams of carbs\n\n\n\n“I like to restrict carbs enough to keep the body kind of ‘hungry’ for carbs. And that way, when I consume a little bit of carbs, you’re highly efficient at utilizing and getting that glucose where it needs to be to replenish some muscle glycogen, or to have a restorative, reparative, effect.”\nTotal carb restriction\n\nWith prolonged total carb restriction, you will produce a physiological glucose/carbohydrate intolerance \nAnd if you go back to eating carbs, you’re going to have a hyper-insulin response and hyperglycemia \nWhereas just keeping a little bit of carbohydrates in, you can maintain your carbohydrate tolerance\n\nCarb backloading concept\n\nKiefer came up with the idea of carb backloading\nIt basically looks like…\n\nBreakfast and lunch is low-carb/keto\nExercise later in the day or the evening, and that’s when you would ramp up the carbohydrates\n\n\nKiefer’s rationale:\n\nYou’re more insulin sensitive in the morning and a little more insulin resistant at night (just general circadian rhythm)\nTherefore, you may be more susceptible to storing your energy as fat when you’re more insulin sensitive in the morning\nSo you basically ride out the overnight fast, which increases fat oxidation, keep carbs at a minimum \nThen you train and exercise and eat the carbs right after your exercise\nThe thought is that after a hard workout you’d partition more glucose to the muscles and less to fat, in part because of the non-insulin mediated glucose uptake, and in part because the fat cells may be a little more insulin resistant at night \nFurthermore, the carbs Kiefer suggested eating were higher glycemic (e.g., cherry turnovers) which would spike insulin and spike the growth after a workout\n\n\n\n-Dom’s take:\n\nDom says the slow-carbs with high fiber are better for him personally\nA square of 80-85% dark chocolate is a good dessert option and doesn’t make him want to devour the whole bar ⇒ “It’s very satisfying just to have, so it’s kind of self-limiting.”\nEating cherry turnovers or other sugary hyper-palatable things is especially bad for those who are inclined to have binge eating behaviors\n\nDom’s take on “carb up” days for ketogenic dieters [2:01:00]\nCarb up days\n\nDom doesn’t do “carb up” days\nRather, he will increase his total calories by about 25% a couple days a week\nBut he just eats more of the same foods he already eats\nGenerally, this means a bit more protein around his heavy training days\nWhen “carbing up” in the past, it would trigger a roller coaster in energy levels for Dom\n“I get the same effect without the hormonal roller coaster.”\n\n*Beware if you have addictive eating behaviors \n\nSome people are proponents of carb up day and cheat days\nLike the cyclical ketogenic diet approach, or the Anabolic Diet by Mauro Di Pasquale where one day a week you flip the macros and go high carb, low fat\nBut Bob points out that for people who are addicted to bad foods, this can backfire\n\nSort of like a smoker who tries to just have one cigarette or smoke cigarettes “in moderation”\n\n\nDr. Steve Phinney describes something called “intrusive thoughts of hunger” where a person might have a voice in their head that says, “Wouldn’t you like to have that donut?” \n\nThe good news is that this voice goes away over time, “And it’s amazing that you might not miss those things as much as you think you would.”\n\n\n\nPET scans showing addictive behavior\n\nPET scans of the brain of people eating meals show that obese people leave “no doubt that the obese person is activating the same mechanisms of addiction with this kind of feeding”\n\nDom’s thoughts on the carnivore diet and the paleolithic ketogenic diet [2:05:30]\n⇒ For Dom thoughts on the carnivore diet check out this YouTube video \nThe paleolithic ketogenic diet \n\nA group in Hungary called Paleomedicina is studying the paleolithic ketogenic diet (similar to the carnivore diet) \nIt’s shown to be pretty effective for managing a number of things, especially autoimmune disorders and gut health\nDiet includes a lot of pork, organ meats, no dairy, no nuts, no plants at all\nNote: Dom says he personally eats plants but if he eliminated them he doesn’t think it would either help or harm his health\nThe Paleomedicina folks would be of the opinion that plants are doing harm, especially ones high in oxalates like broccoli\n\nType 1 diabetes\n\nThey’ve been using the diet to type 1 diabetes and argue that they may be actually restoring some of the insulin function with the diet (at least when looking at C-peptide)\n\nGut health\n\nDom calls this the most convincing thing about their approach\nThey use PEG 400 as a means to determine gut health\nYou consume it orally, collect it in the urine, and you can see an index of gut permeability as it pertains to leaky gut \nLeaky gut being defined by gaps in the gastrointestinal mucosa and being compromised by openings of the tight junctions that hold the cells together\nAnd the therapeutic response to the paleolithic ketogenic diet correlates to restored gut function and decreased gut permeability\n\n⇒ Dom says to check out their Paleomedicina’s website and look through their papers \n⇒ Another resource: Dr. LÁSZLÓ G. BOROS is a pioneer with the science of deuterium depleted water and getting your body in a fat-adapted state\nAdvantage of the ketogenic diet for extreme endurance athletes [2:10:30]\nKeto and ultrarunners\n\nDom thinks it could work really well for ultrarunners\nZach Bitter is an example of someone who thrives on high fat, low carbs\nHowever, athletes need to give their body time to fully adapt\n\nLogistical advantage\n\nOne big advantage is the logistical aspect – less need to be refeeding during a race\nEssentially, fat adapted runners have better access to their fat stores for fuel and you can see this by looking at the respiratory quotient\nAn RQ of 0.7 is a pretty good indication that they have extremely good access to their stored body fat\n\nFor more on fat burning zones and respiratory quotient check out AMA #9 as well as this blog post \n\n\nEven a lean person has ~30,000 calories in the form of fat, whereas our carbohydrate calories would maybe be like 2000, 2500, and you can burn through that in an ultramarathon\n\nRecovery advantage\n\nThe keto diet promotes many adaptations that can enhance recovery from the crazy workouts\nSome guys can do an ultra marathon and then do another one immediately afterwards\nAnd that was previously unheard of and Dom thinks being low carb, high fat has allowed for that to happen\n\nGI system\n\nConstant refeeds of goos and gels is hard on the GI system and so the less refeeds needed the better\nAlso, the gut is 70% of the immune system so these strenuous endurance events put extra stress on the GI so less refeeds could mitigate that to some degree\n\nImpact on strength, power, and performance of the adaptation period to the ketogenic diet [2:14:00]\nWhen first starting a ketogenic diet…\n\nYou’re likely to experience a negative hit to your physiological, cognitive, and even immunological performance because it’s a stress to your body\n\nYou’re basically forcing it to use another fuel that you’re not fully adapted to using\n\n\nYou can compare this stress to exercise adaptation—if you go from 20 min of exercise and increase to 2 hours, you’re going to be in pain and sore\nBut skeletal muscles are incredibly adaptable including the process of adapting the energy system being used in the skeletal muscle\nIn time, with the keto diet\n\ni) the fatty acid oxidation skyrocket, and\n ii) your liver to beta oxidation of fatty acids and ketone production will skyrocket over time\n\n\n\n⇒ Dom’s study: Ketogenic diet does not affect strength performance in elite artistic gymnasts \nThe magnitude of the negative consequences will depend on the individual\n\nExample – Endurance athletes may already be somewhat keto adapted because there’s post-exercise ketosis. And if you exercise long enough and deplete your liver glycogen, you enter a state of ketosis.\nThe normal everyday person probably will go through a time of discomfort during the adaptation period\n\nNOTE: Not everybody’s going to adapt, but most people will\nThose people will just have to accept this initial phase and know it will get better\n\n\n\nHow long to adapt?\n\nPhinney and Volek, in The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Performance, discuss keto adaptation could be weeks to months\n\nSpecifically, the heart and the skeletal muscle increase their utilization of fatty acids over time\nOn the low end, it might be a couple of weeks\n\n\nBut Dom thinks you’re not really getting full adaptation until about six months\n\n*The best way to fully adapt is to train while in the state of ketosis—to put your body under extreme stress in that physiological state\nFasted-state elevation in growth hormone and its impact on training [2:17:45]\nGrowth hormone (GH) \n\nGH elevation occurs during a fast\nBut Dom is not convinced it gives a training advantage or helps with muscle gain\nThere are advantages to training in a fasted state\n\nE.g., Eating a large meal before training could have a 500% or more increase in blood flow to your gastrointestinal system, to the organs, to the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, small intestines, large intestines and your stomach\n\nThat’s taking away blood that could otherwise be going to your muscles\n\n\nCaveat: A small meal may work for people (~500 calories or less)\n\n\n\nWhy does GH rise in a fasted state?\n\nThe elevation in growth hormone is just a consequence of our physiology and to liberate more fat for energy through the lipolytic effect\nIt may have an anti catabolic effect—so enhancing lipolysis may be sparing muscle to some extent \nGrowth hormone is anabolic to some extent…but growth hormone will cause an increase in tissue of all your organs too\nWhereas things like anabolic steroids are sort of tissue specific to skeletal muscle protein synthesis\n\nBut to the question of, Is there a significant advantage to the GH elevation associated with faster training?\n\n“Maybe, but it’s not something that I think about” says Dom\nRather, he’s focused on being in an optimal physiological state for training—fully fed the prior day, glycogen is up, and he’s well rested\nHe then goes into the workout fasted between 8 and 16 hours and that’s when he has his best workouts and when he most often hits his personal records\n\nIs it possible to build muscle on a ketogenic diet? [2:23:30]\nIf you’re training in a fasted state…\n\nThe key thing to remember is that you’re probably going to be a little bit dehydrated which means your blood volume is down and it’ll be harder to get a pump and maintain a high workout intensity\nTips:\n\nDrink water\nTake some sugar free electrolytes that has salt (Dom uses LMNT by Robb Wolf)\nCreatine might also be helpful (Dom takes 5 g prior to his workout)\n\n\n\nAdding muscle on a keto diet\n–Maintenance mode\n\nDom is now doing mostly maintenance with no aspirations to be any bigger or heavier\nHe’s noticed that if I stops doing heavy compound lifts (deadlifts, squats, etc.) he will lose some weight\nHis workout for maintenance are really quick\nBut I take a low volume in my training’s really quick\nIn one hour a week, he can maintain his muscle\n\n⇒ Dom’s review: Anticatabolic Effects of Ketone Bodies in Skeletal Muscle \n-Adding muscle using a ketogenic diet\n\nDom says he would need to double or triple his training volume in order to add muscle mass\nTwo or three hours a week of really intense, structured training\nBut most important in adding mass happens with nutrition\nDom spikes protein two or three times a week if I’m trying to gain and does so to correlate with recovery from heavier workouts\nSo adding muscle on a keto diet is “definitely possible”\n\n⇒ Dom’s study: The effects of ketogenic dieting on skeletal muscle and fat mass\nWhy Dom took a year off from weight training [2:28:00]\n\nDom recently moved to a farm property that needed a lot of work\nThe work was time consuming and physically demanding\nHe took this time to prioritize and experiment with body weight exercises\nHe has a weighted vest that allows him to add resistance as well\nHe was also able to turn the property work into “farm strength” such as the process of lighting logs into the back of a truck\n\nWhat does Dom do for cardio exercise? [2:30:45]\n\nDom doesn’t do deliberate/traditional cardio exercises\nHe does a lot of walking, typically 30 minutes with the dogs after a meal\nHe will do high rep deadlifts \n315 lbs for 60 seconds, 3 rounds\nHe tends to get his “cardio” in by doing work around his property, e.g., tree cutting and lifting them into a chipper\n\n“I am convinced that it’s the reason why I’ve never really been injured. Just growing up bailing hay. I was like 12, 13 years old. And then I kind of built the foundation of farm strength. And then that really helped me later on.”\nProtocols for hard training recovery [2:33:15]\nRed Light therapy\n\nDom uses the Joovv Elite red light system \n\n(for more devices Dom uses click here)\n\n\n2 or 3 times per week after a heavy lift\nThere’s a ton of research on photobiomodulation\n“The Joovv Elite system is like the best system that I know.”\nDom says he feels like he recovers faster and feels less sore \n\nDead hangs\n\nDom does this every day \nGrab onto a pull up bar and hang for 60 secs\nNot only works your grip, but it’s stretching all the muscles underneath the intercostal muscles, the AB muscles, it’s also decompressing the spine. \nWill sometimes do weighted hangs sometimes too\n“And I feel like it’s really strengthening the grip and my lats and everything.”\n\nNutrition\n\nNutritionally, he will bump up protein in order to boost calories by about 25% \n\nWalking\n\n“I feel it’s important to just take a walk after big meals.” \n\nDom’s personal approach to fasting, time-restricted eating, and sleep [2:35:45]\nDom’s 7 day fast\n\nDom doesn’t do many multiple day fasts\nBut he did do one experiment where he fasted for 7 days\n\nAnd at the end he deadlift 500+ lbs for 10 reps\nOn the other days during that specific fast, what did he do for exercise?\nMostly body weight exercises (push ups and chin ups)\nOne day at the gym training shoulders and arms\n\n\nOther observations:\n\nFeeling cold – By the 7 day mark, Dom felt cold like his metabolism might be slowing down (See Peter explaining this here)\nNo soreness – Two days after his heavy lift, when he would normally experience delayed onset soreness, he had absolutely no soreness at all\n\n\n\nHow Dom typically incorporates fasting into his life:\n\nDom doesn’t fast every day\nMaybe 2 or 3 times a week he will do some time-restricted feeding\nOn days when he is planning to train in the evening, he makes sure to have breakfast otherwise he can’t seem to get in all the calories he needs post-workout without disrupting his sleep\n\nSleep\n\nDom prioritizes his sleep\nEarly bedtime and has a sleep routine\nHe tracks it with Oura Ring and Fitbit Inspire\nBob asks Dom how he manages to get so much deep sleep (from Dom’s instagram posts)\n“I have to do everything right.
