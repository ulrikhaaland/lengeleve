For example, in airport metal detectors looking for a gun, if the machine is extremely sensitive, individuals carrying virtually any metal will set off the detector (i.e., low false negatives). However, the more sensitive the test, the greater the risk for false alarms (i.e., high false positives), and therefore the lower the specificity. The higher the sensitivity, the lower the specificity.\nThe same is true in cancer screening. If an MRI can detect tumors < 1 mm in size, it’s highly sensitive. However, the test is going to be less specific. More false alarms. The opposite is true as well. If an MRI only detects tumors > 5 cm, the test will be highly specific (i.e., low false positives), but have low sensitivity (i.e., high false negatives). The higher the specificity, the lower the sensitivity.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4348 size-medium alignnone\"

height=\"238\" />\nHere’s an example: 500,000 people are screened for thyroid cancer with a population prevalence of 0.16%. The screening tool used is ultrasound with 98% sensitivity and 54% specificity.\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4354\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/thyroid.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2398px) 100vw, 2398px\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/thyroid.png 2398w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/thyroid-300x123.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/thyroid-768x315.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/thyroid-1024x419.png 1024w\" alt=\"\" width=\"2398\" height=\"982\" />\nWe can see from this example that the NPV is virtually 100%. What it appears to be showing is that if you test negative, you almost assuredly don’t have thyroid cancer. While true, this is misleading. Only 0.16% of the population tested has thyroid cancer. Because 99.84% of the people tested don’t have thyroid cancer, the NPV can’t be less than 99.84%.\nWe can also see that even with a high sensitivity, which tells us the true positive rate, the PPV is a remarkably low 0.3%. This means that if a person tests positive for thyroid cancer, the likelihood that he or she has thyroid cancer is about 1-in-300, or 0.3%.\nHere’s a different example: 500,000 women are screened for breast cancer with a population prevalence of 11%. The screening tool used is Prenuvo MRI with 92% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity.\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4355\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mammo-vigilance-mri.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2872px) 100vw, 2872px\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mammo-vigilance-mri.png 2872w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mammo-vigilance-mri-300x102.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mammo-vigilance-mri-768x262.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mammo-vigilance-mri-1024x349.png 1024w\" alt=\"\" width=\"2872\" height=\"980\" />\nThe NPV is 99%. Because population prevalence in this example is higher (i.e., 11%), the NPV is more informative. However, even in this population, the number of false negatives is fixed to a low percentage (e.g., if Prenuvo MRI had no ability to detect cancer, the NPV would be 89%).\nThe PPV in this example is 96.6%. The probability that a woman has cancer if she tests positive is about 97-in-100, or 97%. In contrast, the PPV for mammography screening, for example, is ~ 10.6%. However, the population prevalence of breast cancer is ~ 1% for asymptomatic women when regular mammography screening intervals are recommended, which skews the PPV lower (e.g., if the population prevalence for the Prenuvo MRI example was 1%, the PPV would be ~ 70%). In this light, the Prenuvo MRI example may represent a follow-up screen for a population of women who had a positive mammography.\nPutting it all together\nSensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV shouldn’t be judged in isolation. At first blush, it may appear that a test with 100% sensitivity is the perfect test to determine if someone truly has cancer. However, imagine that this test consists of sending an identical letter to 500,000 random postal addresses and informing the head of household that he or she is positive for cancer. This test would guarantee 100% sensitivity: any person in the sample who truly has cancer is a true positive. There are zero false negatives in the sample since no letters informed the recipient that he or she is negative. Therefore, a test with 100% sensitivity can be completely useless in practice without considering specificity. The test would have 0% specificity.\nThe converse is true as well. Imagine the letter sent to 500,000 was instead a negative letter. It would identify 100% of the true negatives and would yield zero false positives. The test would have 100% specificity. But it would also carry with it 0% sensitivity.\nSimilarly, in the positive-letter example, 100% sensitivity may be misleading in terms of its ability to predict someone has cancer. If the population prevalence was 0.5%, the PPV would also be 0.5%, meaning the test is no better than, well, sending random letters to postal addresses. The same holds true for the negative-letter example.\nDiagnostic measures help us determine if our screening tools are effective at detecting when cancer is present or not. Often, these measures can be misleading, especially when evaluated in isolation. It’s important to look at diagnostics in context."
