  "title": "#40 – Tom Catena, M.D.: The world’s most important doctor – to nearly a million patients – saving countless lives in the war-torn and remote villages of Sudan",
  "content": "In this episode, Tom Catena, a missionary physician who runs Mother of Mercy Hospital in the Nuba Mountains in Sudan, describes some of his extraordinary work as the only doctor in a remote, war-torn region of Africa. In terms of individual lives saved, you could argue that there is no other person on the front lines doing more than Tom. Additionally, we explore the manner in which the Nuba people die, which is in striking contrast to the ubiquity of chronic disease and self-harm in the west, despite the extreme poverty and unimaginable suffering experienced by the Nuba people. Lastly, we discuss the lessons to be gleaned from the Nuba people, who despite their suffering, live so harmoniously, happily, and resiliently.

The following are some of the most urgent needs:\nOperating eye microscope and associated supplies \n\nFunds needed = $40,000\nThese funds would be enough for ~600 eye operations\n\nHousing\n\nFunds needed = $100,000\nMother of Mercy hospital operates at 100% capacity at all times\nThese funds would allow the hospital to build 2 additional much-needed units\n\nBatteries for solar panels\n\nFunds needed = $15,000\nMother of Mercy hospital runs on 100% solar power and needs battery replacements every so often to keep everything running without interruption\n\nPay for a C-section\n\nEach C-section costs roughly $250\nChildbirth mortality is a major problem in Nuba, and your donation could save the life of the mother and/or child\n\n§\n\n            \n            Show NotesBackground, medical training, and early days of missionary work in Africa [9:00]\n\nGrew up in Amsterdam, New York\nMajored in mechanical engineering while at Brown University, (also played football at Brown)\nWhile at Brown, decided he wanted to do missionary it but need to get a degree in medicine\nMed school at Duke on scholarship from the Navy\n5 years serving Navy\nResidency at family practice in Indiana\nThen left for Kenya \n\nKenya\n\nGot there January 17, 2000\nTeamed up with Catholic Medical Mission Board\nWorked at Our Lady of Lourdes Mutomo Hospital in the rural settlement of Mutomo, Kenya\nWas supposed to stay one year and then come back, but fell in love with the place\n\nWhat was it like?\n\nHad to learn surgery, obstetrics, C-sections to be of more help\nVolume of patients was crazy\n\nWas seeing 50-60 patients per day\nIn residency in US it was 5 or 6\n\n\nVariety of diseases\n\nMalaria, tuberculosis, leishmaniasis\n“all this kind of stuff I had no idea about”\n\n\n\nDeciding to go to Sudan\n“The modus operandi of my life was always looking for. . .the opposite of greener pastures. I’m looking for browner pastures.”\n\nStayed in Mutomo, Kenya for 2.5 years\nThen went to Turkana, Kenya and worked at the Kakuma Mission Hospital\nWhile in Turkana, he learned about the harsh conditions of Sudan, which intrigued him…\n\n“The conditions there were terrible. . .such a lack of any kind of health services. I thought, “Man, I’d really like to get involved in that struggle, just to go and work with and help the people there’. The health facilities were so limited. I thought, ‘That’s kind of the place I want to go to.’”\n\nHe then moved to St Mary’s Mission Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya\nThere he worked with the Bishop of the El Obeid Diocese, Macram Gassis to plan out the Sudan hospital in the Nuba Mountains (where Tom is today)\nPlanning took 6 years\nIt was all funded by Catholic Diocese of El Obeid who raised funds through the church mechanism\nTom arrives in the Nuba Mountains on March 10, 2008\n\nTom arrives at Mother of Mercy Hospital in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan, civil war breaks out, and his staff evacuates [15:45]\nSome history of Nuba\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6671 size-full\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/nuba-mountains-map.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/nuba-mountains-map.jpg 480w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/nuba-mountains-map-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" />\nFigure 1.

There’s no way I can in good conscience leave this place, and go out. It was a very, very stark reality. And to be honest with you, it was not a difficult decision.” \n“Let’s just stick it out, we’re here as missionaries, let’s do what we’re supposed to do and take care of the people as best we can. And come what may. We have faith in God. We’ll see what happens.”\nThat said, he does not hold it against the others that left\n\nAfter the staff left:\n\nBiggest problem was anesthesiology for surgery\nThe morning that the staff left, there was a bombing by the North Sudan’s air force\nYou can hear the sounds of the Antonov planes in the film Heart of Nuba\nMangled bodies start rolling in\nHuge shards of metal tore through people creating massive tissue loss and trauma\n\nGirl needing arm amputated\n\nFirst case after staff evacuated\nGirl came in needing her arm amputated\nNeither Tom, nor the nurses knew how to do general anesthesia \nThey literally read a basic anesthesia book that listed it out step by step\nTom had to intubate the patient, which can kill them if done wrong, something Tom had never done before\nBy the grace of God, got the patient intubated\nThen someone had to manually ventilate the patient throughout the entire surgery\nAll they had was an Oxford Miniature Ventilator\n\nPeter is flabbergasted and goes on a brief rant\n\nThey were without an anesthetist for 2 months\nTom can’t measure blood gasses (PaO2, PaCO2)\nHe also had no pulse oximeter which measures the percentage of oxygen saturation\nThis means the nurse has to figure out how to ventilate, which means how much oxygen the person needs and how much CO2 you take off… and if you screw either of those two up, you will kill someone\nPeter then says if you were to put him in the same spot and said… “All you have to do is be the guy that manually ventilates them… I wouldn’t be able to do that. I would overdo it or under do it. There’s no way you’d hit that sweet spot.”\n\nIntussusception in a baby\n\nNine month old baby\nintussusception is when the intestine telescopes on itself and basically causes a blockage of the intestine\nThe longer you delay, that intestine can die and the person will die from infection\n“We made the diagnosis and I’m just like, ‘Oh God, what are we supposed to do with this kid?’”\nBut managed to get baby intubated\nDid a bowel resection \nAnd now he’s nine years old, “he’s cruising”\n\nWhat other kinds of injuries occur when shrapnel is going through people?\n\nLiver lacerations, bowel injuries, hemopneumothorax, head trauma, kidney trauma, etc.\nWhy do you have so many extremity traumas? ⇒ “Because they’re the ones who actually survive”\nOne guy has 23 holes in his intestines that “we had to resect here, resect there, stitch this one… just took forever”\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6677 size-large\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amputation-1024x673.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"673\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amputation-1024x673.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amputation-300x197.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/amputation-768x505.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 2.

Roughly 750,000 people being served by Tom’s single hospital (physical area around size of Austria)\nHow much knowledge do the Nuba people have outside of their small world?\n\nVery little\nExample, Tom’s wife’s mother has lived entire life in her tribe in Nuba Mountains\nShe has never heard of the United States, thought Tom was from Kenya\nNo concept of an ocean\nShe didn’t even know she was in Africa\n\n“A lot of my wife’s siblings have never been out of this 15 square mile radius. You can’t imagine the worldview.”\nTom’s wife first time outside Africa\n\nShortly after getting married, they went to Armenia which was her first time outside rural Africa\nNext went to Dubai, airport was crazy, so much electricity\nNever seen flushing toilets, elevators, etc.\nFirst time to the US…\nWent to New York, Time Square\nWent to Boston (North Shore) ⇒ first time to see ocean\n“My family just went crazy with her. They had so much fun being with her, seeing all these things for the first time through her eyes. She has an infectious joy to her and they really kind of tapped into that.”\nWhile in the US, Tom’s wife accepted an award on behalf of Tom giving to him by Medicines for Humanity\n\nPeter’s moving encounter with the Sudanese people\n\nPeter took the whole family to the Sudanese Community Center in San Diego to deliver Christmas gifts\nBasically all refugees there\nPeter’s youngest child (1.5 years) was playing with a similar-aged Sudanese child\nThere’s a woman that’s holding the Sudanese girl and she was sort of keeping an eye on Peter’s son as well\nA few hours later they thank the young mother for watching their son, and turns out she wasn’t even related to the Sudanese child\n“We couldn’t stop talking about that… talk about a different sense of community.” says Peter\n\n“For as many things as they lack, they have something we don’t have.”\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6676 size-large\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-10-at-8.24.12-AM-1024x635.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"635\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-10-at-8.24.12-AM-1024x635.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-10-at-8.24.12-AM-300x186.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-10-at-8.24.12-AM-768x476.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 4.

So, I grew up in a big family and my brothers could never be [in Nuba], but at the same time I could not do what they’re doing. . .So, I think, yeah, I’m very comfortable there, but I couldn’t maybe fit working in New York.”\nTom says everybody has something to contribute\n“I think everybody has something to offer and if we try to get in this thinking like, ‘Gosh, I’m not doing what he’s doing, I should be doing what he’s doing.’ I think we miss the point. We miss out on our shared abilities.”\n“I think it’s good to be aware of what’s going on in the world and everybody should think about their brothers and sisters elsewhere and contribute and do something to help other people. At the same time don’t spend too much time stressing that you’re not doing enough. . . do something, but it shouldn’t be something which is agonizingly painful.”\n“It’s a sacrifice. It is. And I miss my family like crazy. . .but I’m pretty comfortable in that weird, remote setting in the Nuba mountains.”\nNY Times article about Tom’s work, and Tom’s new venture on the board of Aurora Prize Foundation bringing awareness and funding to other missionaries doing great work [1:03:30] \nHere is the NY Times article by Nicholas Kristof: ‘He’s Jesus Christ’\nHere is the 10-min video from that article: The Worst Atrocity You’ve Never Heard Of: Sudan’s Nuba Mountains\n<iframe title=\"The Worst Atrocity You&#039;ve Never Heard Of: Sudan&#039;s Nuba Mountains | The New York Times\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kG4xMTlPt6I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nPeter’s comment on the article: “But I think the point Kristof makes, and makes it beautifully, is if you want to be critical of all of the religious hypocrisy, by all means do so. But you can’t then fail to acknowledge the times when, in the name of religion, people are doing these incredible things.”\nHow did Nick Kristof learn about Tom?\n\nAlways had an interest in Sudan after seeing what al-Bashir was doing to the people\nHe made a couple of trips into the Nuba mountains\nTo get there…\nYou can fly into Juba\nThen take a flight up to the refugee camp in Yida\nAnd then, you can manage to come into Nuba mountains\nYou don’t come in with official permission of the Sudan government\nHe just has an interest in that part of the world and really wanted to do something that shed light on the situation there, against Bashir\nHe had been to Nuba, I think, one previous time and heard about the hospital, wanted to come see us there and see what kind of work we were doing, to see for himself, and was there for a few days. He’s a really intrepid traveler, an incredible journalist.\n“What I respect about him the most is he can disagree with you, whatever, religiously, politically not agree with your beliefs, but he could realize what you’re doing has benefit, and he can look at it objectively and say okay, I don’t believe in this religion, but I see what these guys are doing, and highlight that. Not many people are willing to do that.”\n“Certainly the Nuba Mountains are a better place because of Nicholas’s work.”\n\nTom’s work with the Aurora Prize organization\n“Aurora’s focus is on highlighting what they say is unsung heroes, but people that are kind of operating in the weeds, that nobody knows about. So shine a bit of spotlight on them, not so much for publicity, but to help them both in their work, and by raising their profile you raise the issues that they’re involved with.”\nTom won the 2017 Aurora Prize for his work in Nuba: DR. TOM CATENA – 2017 AURORA PRIZE LAUREATE\nHere’s the video made for Tom as an Aurora Prize finalist: 2016 Aurora Prize Finalist, Dr. Tom Catena: Courage You Would Never Expect\nThe Aurora Prize gives away 1 million dollars yearly to people doing humanitarian work and allows them to elect which charity that money goes towards (although it’s a finite time period of 8 years so it ends in 2023)\nTom now works with Aurora as a chairman of the organization\n⇒ “But I thought maybe using Aurora as a vehicle, it was time to come out, to kind of see what was out there, and to try to expand the model that we have in the Nuba Mountains. So to find a way to bridge the gap between big donors … and small organizations, people on the ground that are doing a lot of the grassroots work and doing it very efficiently.”\nMoney goes a LONG way in Africa\nAt Tom’s hospital, for example…\n⇒ For 1 million dollars:\n\nCould see 130,000 outpatients\ndo close to 2,000 operations\n6,000 inpatients\nvaccinate tens of thousands of children\nseveral thousand maternity patients for that\n\n“If someone gave us a million bucks, we could easily run the hospital for a year and probably expand quite a bit what we’re already doing.”\nBiggest problem is logistics of getting the supplies\n\nThe #1 challenge is logistics\nSupplies have to come from Nairobi which is 2 countries away\nFirst goest through Uganda, up to the border with South Sudan where they just harass the heck out of the drivers\nYou’ve got to bribe the guards and they’re always changing the rules\n30-40 checkpoints along the way \nIt takes weeks to get to Yida, South Sudan\nThen its 6 hours dirt roads to get from Yida to Nuba\n\n“We try to make it one full year on that supply that gets sent in. The problem comes. . .when it’s not in stock, and you can’t order one-off things. There’s no system to get stuff up to us. So it’s really hard. If you can’t load everything on that truck for this one go, we’re a bit stuck, and we’ve got to be really creative trying to get these other small things up.”\nTom’s mind-blowing ability to deal with chaos while seeing hundreds of patients per day [1:15:45]\n“It’s the theater of the absurd. It’s crazy.”\nMortality of childbirth \n\nInfant mortality still very high\n\nMost neonatal deaths are just from difficult deliveries (baby gets asphyxiated, baby’s born and dies, either is a stillborn, or dies soon after birth) \n99% of women there still deliver at home, but many of the infant deaths would have survived with a c-section\nHow many babies born at his hospital? ⇒ 400 per year, very small compared to home deliveries\n\n\nMortality of mothers\n\nUnknown\nIt’s so remote, and people are so spread out, there’s not really a system to collect that kind of information\nIt’s likely pretty high because we have a lot of women that we end up doing C-sections on that would have died without that\n\n\n\nLearning surgery on YouTube\n\nPartial nephrectomy (removing part of a kidney because of a tumor)\nHad never done one\nWatched a YouTube video \nThen successfully performed the surgery\n\nHundreds of patients\n\n435 beds at Tom’s hospital\nIt always at 100% occupancy\nAt peak of war, it would be 550 people there, just laying all over the ground\nPeter says: “It looks like when you see movies in war zones, and you see the tents that are serving as hospitals, and you just see amputation, nose completely missing, the most gruesome things. That’s what it looks like you’re in.”\nA US hospital, by comparison… Peter says in residency it was grueling to get through 20 patients in a day\nTom sees about 300 per day nowadays\nHowever it used to be more in the past\n\nChallenges of the remote location of Nuba\n\nOnce had a measles epidemic and he was seeing 225 kids per day on top of everything else\nThey couldn’t get vaccines to Nuba because they were in rebel-territory\n“The sovereignty of a government that kills its own people, it needs to be respected?”\nWe’d start at 7:30 in the morning, and 2:00 I’d be finishing up. \nBut constantly interrupted by emergencies coming in\n\n“All this stuff was still going on. It was pretty crazy. You really had to just go as fast as you could. There was a lot of just putting out fires. We weren’t able to spend a lot of time with each patient, obviously. It was really, you had to go pretty rapid fire through all those cases. It was exhausting. Psychologically, it was rough.”\nThe most afraid Tom has ever been, and how he copes with the emotional trauma of his daily experiences [1:23:30]\nTom’s Nuba hospital was bombed twice by the North Sudan military\n“You’re totally at the mercy of these people, and you feel like you’re just like a hunted animal. That’s what I felt like. I felt like I’m a hunted animal.”\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6672 size-large\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hiding-from-bomb-1024x663.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"663\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hiding-from-bomb-1024x663.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hiding-from-bomb-300x194.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hiding-from-bomb-768x497.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 5. Nuba child hiding in a foxhole watching the North Sudan aircraft, the Antonov, fly overhead. Image credit: Youtube: The Heart of Nuba – 15 minute supercut\nFirst time, they were at church\n“The mass was over. We were standing there. All of a sudden, somebody says, ‘Everybody get down!’. So we just dive on the ground, we’re just lying flat, and I heard the airplane droning overhead, this Antonov sound. Then I heard the pitch change. It was high-pitched like a whirring sound, almost like a jet engine noise. And then boom, this incredibly loud explosion.”\n“They bombed six times. You kept hearing this thing. . .And you’re lying there terrified, you feel like you want to burrow yourself into the ground and disappear.” \nThe second time, Tom was inside the hospital\n“I was in the hospital and just down on the floor of the hospital. You know, you’re just thinking, this might be it. Because you can’t tell where it’s going to fall. You hear that whirring sound, and when you hear that whirring sound, you don’t know if that’s going to fall on top of you, if it’s going to fall right next to you and shatter your body. You have no idea. So it’s really terrifying.\nTom wonders why\n“You’re thinking, ‘what are these people doing? How can they bomb us? Don’t they know there are people down here?’. That’s what I felt, like it was some exercise where they made a mistake.” \nBut I really hope someday I will meet these pilots. I don’t even feel any animosity towards them. . .t’s strange. You don’t feel anger. You don’t feel animosity towards these people, just kind of wonderment like, ‘What are they doing? Why are they doing this?’”\nPhysical and mental exhaustion and emotional trauma\n“The emotional trauma…is probably worse than the physical degradation your body takes by just always being on call. Even when you’re not called that night, it’s hard to sleep. There’s a lot of fear and worry about things. . .There’s always that sense of worry about you’ll be in physical danger. But even when you’re out of that, when the risk of physical danger’s not there, it’s just the psychological thought of always being responsible for the patients and not having a psychological rest. I can’t refer these people somewhere. There aren’t other colleagues we can talk to or get advice on or have somebody else see these patients. It is very draining.” \nHow does Tom cope with and manage the emotional distress of his environment?\n\nDraws on his faith\nGets strength from the amazing Nuba people\n\n“You see the strength and resilience of the Nuba people. You say well, okay, if they can put up with this environment and keep functioning, keep going ahead, let me just try to keep taking care of them as best I can.”\nThe basic tools, technologies, and medicines that Tom is lacking that could save many lives [1:33:30]\n\nTom has an ultrasound\nHe has an x-ray machine\n\nBiggest challenge is lab work\n\nHis machines keep breaking down\nCould really use a Piccolo lab machine\n\nCosts roughly $14,000\nAnd would need a year supply of discs for the machine\n\n\n\nAcute leukemia in children\n\nIf a child has acute leukemia, Tom can’t send them to Kenya, too far and costly\nCan’t treat them chemotherapy either\nThey basically help them with palliative care (end of life care)\n\nChronic leukemia in adults\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)\n\nTom is able to treat them with cyclophosphamide\nPeriodic injections\nThis is pretty effective \n\nChronic myelocytic leukemia (CML)\n\nTom does NOT have a treatment for this\nBut CML is very treatable with the drug called Gleevec\nIt’s too expensive yet it would cure almost all cases of CML\nIt costs $7,000 per month\nHe can’t spend $80,000, for example, to treat one patient knowing that $80,000 could save hundreds of lives\nTom has to make these agonizing decisions constantly…\n\n“Yeah. It’s agonizing. It’s absolutely agonizing. And that’s just one example of many.”\nWatch Tom explain one of these agonizing decisions:\n<iframe title=\"Tom&#039;s Choice\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-cuPm8E-K0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nTom’s current patient (a mother with CML) desperately needs Gleevec\n“It’s absolutely agonizing. I cannot send her anywhere. It’s totally impossible.”\n\nShe’s got a huge spleen that hurts, she’s anemic\nAnd she’s got a bunch of kids\nShe walks for days to each time she visits the hospital despite her condition\nOnly a small amount of Gleevec would get her through the year\nShe is one of only a few people with CML so they really don’t need much\n\nThe logistical challenge of helping Tom’s hospital, and what Tom really needs [1:39:15]\nHow would someone even logistically go about providing specific or project-based funding to your mission?\nFirst step is to contact the Catholic Medical Mission Board (CMMB) ⇒ For example, if someone were to send Gleevec to CMMB, and they could find a way to get it to Juba, then they might be able to find a way to get it to Tom in Nuba\nMoney is half the battle, the other half is logistics\n⇒ The logistics problem can be summed up as follows: \n\nThere’s a problem with access to the remote area of Nuba\nGetting through the administrative things you have to do to get some funding and supplies from the big organization that have money to disperse to charity causes\n\nWhat Tom really needs is people\n\nIt’s a daunting task trying to apply to in these big organizations and to just get through that application process to get funds\nThen once you get the funds, you have to account for it and do monitoring and evaluation and follow-up\nTom needs people who are trained in this area of writing proposals and monitoring and evaluation and all this sort of stuff to really follow through with all this\n\nDiseases in the adult population [1:42:30]\nLiver disease is high on the list\n\nCirrhosis\nLiver cancers (mostly from hepatitis B)\n\nHepatitis B is very common\n\nTom vaccinates all the kids in his hospital which is helpful\nHowever, doesn’t have the funds or capability to get vaccines to the villages so it’s still very prevalent\n\nDiphtheria\n\nThis hasn’t been seen since the 1940s in the US yet it shows up in Africa due to lack of vaccines\n\nLeprosy\n\nIn the tuberculosis family\nTransmitted by respiratory droplets and prolonged close contact \nNot by touch which is a misunderstanding, which leads to these people being shunned in the community\n\nTuberculosis ⇒ Very prevalent\nHIV ⇒ actually quite low\n\nLess than 1% \nWhy? Mostly because Nuba is so isolated\nBut if peace comes to the whole region and it opens up you will likely see a rise of HIV because it is sexually transmitted \n\nSTDs are common\n\nGonorrhea\nSyphilis\n\nWhat about heart disease?\n\nNot heart disease, but they do see congestive heart failure for people in their 60s & 70s\nNot atherosclerotic in origin ⇒ Tom’s never seen a single case of myocardial infarction in over 10 years\nHe posits that it is untreated hypertension (many people have BP of 250 over 180)\n\nHow prevalent is obesity?\n⇒ Obesity is almost non-existent (maybe someone is slightly overweight but that’s it)\nWhat about Type 2 Diabetes?\n⇒ Rare, but it is seen in some people in the 50s\nFatty liver disease?\n⇒ Never\nCancers in Nuba versus the US\n\nIn the United States… the top 5 cancers are lung, breast, colon, prostate, pancreas\nNone of these are prevalent in Nuba\n\nCommon cancers in Nuba\n⇒ In kids… \n\nBurkitt’s lymphoma (common in areas with malaria)\nFortunately, this is a very treatable cancer, even in Nuba\n\n⇒ In adults…\nLiver cancer\n\nMost common of all (hepatocellular carcinoma)\nProbably all related to hepatitis B positivity\n\nCervical cancer in women\n\nCan’t do pap smears to screen for HPV because it’s impractical b/c can’t send results to get tested (so even the equipment to do a pap smear wouldn’t be helpful to have)\nWhat would be helpful?\n\nVaccines, specifically Gardasil, but only if they were made available at a very low cost \nBut then we’re back to the logistics problem\nIt would need to be lumped into their annual supplies\n\n\nPreventing cervical cancer through screening\n\nThere is something called the See and treat technique\nThis might be a middle step before Gardasil becomes available\nYou first need the equipment and then you need the staff with the knowledge and it would be pretty labor intensive\n\n\n\nBreast cancer\n\nThere are some cases\nBut nobody is getting a mammogram, so people are only diagnosed when they come in with a noticeable lump\nTreatment in these women is pretty unsuccessful\nWould getting a mammography machine help? ⇒ Partially, but like cervical cancer, Tom would need a whole staff of people to read it… so the machine alone wouldn’t help much\n\nColon cancer\n⇒ Very rare, 2 or 3 cases in 10 years\nWhat is the average life span?\n\nNobody knows their exact age (no birth certificates)\nThey don’t celebrate their birthdays\nTom guesses they don’t live much longer than 70s\n\nMovie recommendation: The Good Lie starring Reese Witherspoon\nDo you see cognitive impairment?\n⇒ Really rare, “they probably die of something else before they reach that stage”\nLiving without possessions, finding meaning, and being a missionary [1:59:30]\nSee this ABC News story for more about Tom’s experience in Nuba and what motivates him to do this work: What it is like being the only doctor in war-torn Sudan’s Nuba Mountains\nHow does Tom handle working around the clock and trying to spend time with his wife?\n\nWhen work is over for the day, there are no distractions\nNo TV, radio, no electricity, so when you’re together, you are really present with each other\nPeter points out: “In a way you may actually spend more time with your kids than many of us do here because of our distractions and our travel and our this and our that.”\n\nDoes Tom feel out of place when he’s back in the US?\n“A little bit. I like it, but I don’t think I could stay long-term. . .I do feel much more at home in the Nuba mountains where it’s very quiet and kind of sedated and your time is your own when you’re off.”\nWhat possessions do you value?\n“I think I’m very much a minimalist since I was born. All these clothes you see me wearing, the socks, the trousers, both these shirts I bought when I came out of Nuba last month.”\n“I really do believe that the more detached you become, not like in this Buddhist kind of nirvana sense, but the more detached you are from things, the easier life is. It just simplifies your life.”\nFinding meaning\n“I do feel better with less and I think everybody is looking for some meaning in life.”\nBook recommendation: Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl\nFavorite Bible passage\nMatthew 19:16-22\nThe verse in Tom’s words:\nThe basic story is there’s a guy, the guy is a very wealthy young man, and he goes to Jesus. It says he tried to justify himself and says, “Look, what do I have to do to get eternal life?” And Jesus says, “Well, follow the prophets. You’ve got all this stuff there. Follow the 10 commandments. Follow the laws of the prophets and you’ll be okay.” And the guy says, “Well, I do all those things. What do we need to do to really become perfect?” And Christ said, “Sell everything you have. Pick up your cross and follow me.” And it says something which I think is very beautiful. It says, “The man went away, very sad because he had many possessions.” He couldn’t do it. \n⇒ Tom’s take: \n\nIt’s not saying being rich is bad, or rich people are bad people. I think that is missing the point. It’s just very difficult because it’s very difficult to be detached from things when you have a lot of possessions.\nIs this thing where you put your values? Is your value in the car you drive, and what kind of beer you drink, or whatever? Or is your value more in people and what you’re doing and how you’re helping people?\n\nWhat it means to be a missionary\n\nPeter says most people picture a missionary as someone who goes into remote areas and “hits people with Bibles”\nYou’re not hitting anybody over the head with a Bible. You’re just sort of saying, “Look, I’m, I’m here to serve you.” And your example is what’s actually doing the talking as opposed to your words. \n\nTom agrees with this sentiment and quotes St. Francis:\n“Preach always, sometimes use words.” \nSense of purpose, happiness, and suicide: Contrasting the US with Nuba [2:11:00]\nAre there any cases of suicide in Nuba?\n\n“Extremely rare”\nPeter surmises, “There must be a different sense of fulfillment, contentment, happiness, sense of purpose there versus here.”\n\nSuicide in the US\n\nSuicide is among the top 10 causes of death in every age demographic except for 0 to 10\nBut that’s just “fast suicide,” when you kill yourself immediately\nWhen you include the ‘slow suicide’, when people that kill themselves with alcohol and drugs over time, it is actually in the top-five causes of death across the board\n\nHow is it that Nuba has 1/1000th of the privilege of the US, yet suicide is so rare?\n“When you’re really gripped in this struggle to survive, every day, you have that sort of primal instinct of survival, your mind doesn’t drift off to other things. . .Suicide is so inward-looking, so focused on your own misery that you can’t come out of it.”\nBook recommendation: Tribe by Sebastian Junger\n\nIn the book, Tribe, he writes about post-9/11, suicide rates went down in New York\nIt speaks to what Tom is saying…\n“When there’s a real struggle, when there’s something that can bring people together in a common goal, or there’s something that unites people, it can presumably distract from some of that pain that can otherwise hurt us.”\n\nRelating it to PTSD in US Veterans\n\nSomebody’s fighting in Iraq or Afghanistan, and they survive all that\nThey come back home, they get despondent and they commit suicide\nTom posits: \n“Maybe what kept them alive during the fighting was a sense of camaraderie, togetherness, fighting for a common goal. . .\n. . .we’ve had this huge rate of suicide amongst veterans that come back. Not so much from the trauma they had during the fighting. . . but the sense of loss of any bonds, that human contact with other people, that sense of purpose is gone.”\n\n“It would be interesting if there would be a way to pair a void that exists here in this country, a void of purpose, with a part of the world where purpose is not lacking, but resources are lacking.”\nOther than donations, is there a way people can help Tom and other similar causes? [2:19:15]\nPeter asks… So how can people help? Giving is of course the most obvious. . . but is there something else people can do?\nFirst of all, \n⇒ “Never underestimate the value of a donation to someone you trust, or a group you trust, or an organization you trust. The amount the impact that has is tremendous. We can’t do anything in our work without financial resources.”\nSecondly, \n⇒ Bringing awareness to those in need\n\n“If you have a knack for advocacy, or work in government, be aware of the political situations there, advocate on behalf of some of these people that are oppressed, or having difficult lives, whether it’s working in issues of poverty, or poor health, poor education. I think people have a voice to offer, and people do have an influence over governments.”\nGovernment policies and government funding is a reflection of the constituents\nSo to fund projects like Mother of Mercy, the politicians will have to know that the people (the constituents) want that\n\nThe ultimate goal of help\n“The goal is to eventually let these people who are beneficiaries stand on their own two feet maybe in the next generation, the next go-around.”\n\nThe cycle of aid and dependency is a bad thing, this is known… \nBut you can’t do anything without some help at this point\nBut let’s make sure that help is “geared towards getting these people to stand on their own two feet”\n\nThe food in Nuba [2:22:30]\n\nVery little variety\nSo little variety that if you asked them what they had for supper they would respond “I had food”\n\nAsida\n\nVery common dish\nA cake made out of sorghum, totally tasteless\n\nTom’s body weight\n\nTom weighed 230 pounds in college\nPlayed football (nose guard) at Brown\nNow weighs about 150 lbs\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6673 size-full\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/doctor-and-football.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/doctor-and-football.jpg 1000w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/doctor-and-football-300x169.jpg 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/doctor-and-football-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" />\nFigure 6.

And the starfish are going to die pretty soon if they don’t get back in the water, which means they’re pretty much all going to die. The two guys are walking, and every few steps, one of the guys bends down and he picks up a starfish and he throws it back in the water. And five steps later, he does it again, and again, and again. After like the 10th one, the one guy says to him, “What are you doing?” And he says, “Well, if these starfish don’t get back in the water, they’re gonna die.” And he goes, “Have you looked and seen how many of them there are? You can’t possibly make a difference.” And he throws another one in the water, and he says, “Well, it made a difference to that one.”\nTom’s response to the story:\nIn the end, medicine is individual. It’s the beauty of our profession. And it’s a huge privilege to have the opportunity to affect one person. And in the end, you close the door and it’s you and the patient, whether you’re in Nuba mountains, whether you’re here in New York. And that’s an incredible privilege. And I think if we keep that focus, just one person at a time, I think people can kind of relax a bit. You can see that what you’re doing for that one person. . .I think people look at Africa and say, “What you’re doing is a drop in the ocean.” I really like that story because when you’re there, you don’t see a drop in the ocean. You see a person. You see a life. And you see somebody that can laugh, and can cry, and can play, has aspirations, and is a living, breathing human being. You think, “Man, we helped this one person.” That’s a huge thing, you know? But I think that helps to stave off some of the burnout and the cynicism. This is a very individual thing, so one person is really a big deal. It’s everything to that one person, that one person’s family. And I think we really have to keep that in mind, especially with this growing realm of cynicism and sort of negativity that we see now.\nPeter sums it up:\n“For people on the front lines, I don’t think there’s a human being on this planet who throws more starfish back in the water than you.”\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialHow you can directly support Tom’s work and change the lives of his patients:\nYou can directly support the needs of the Mother of Mercy Hospital by going to African Mission Healthcare donation page.

On May 28, 2017 he was awarded the second annual Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity, receiving a $100,000 grant and an additional one million dollars for him to distribute to three humanitarian organizations. He has been likened to the 20th-century medical missionary Albert Schweitzer. He has also been called “Jesus Christ” by one muslim man for his amazing ability to treat and save so many patients. Catena graduated with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Brown University in 1986. While at Brown, Catena played nose guard on the Brown Bears football team. He later received his medical degree from Duke University on a U.S. Navy scholarship. During his fourth year at Duke Catena went on his first mission to Kenya in 1992. After graduating, he completed a one-year internship in internal medicine at the Naval Medical Center San Diego in 1993 and later joined the U.S. Navy. For the next four years, he served as a flight surgeon. After his discharge from the Navy in 1997, Catena began a postgraduate residency in family medicine at Union Hospital in Terre Haute, Indiana, while also participating in one-month medical mission trips to Guyana (1997) and Honduras (1998). When he finished his residency in 1999, Catena decided to continue volunteering with the Catholic Medical Mission Board (CMMB) and spent two and a half years as a missionary doctor at Our Lady of Lourdes Mutomo Hospital in the rural settlement of Mutomo, Kenya. From 2002 until 2007, he worked as a consultant at the private St Mary’s Mission Hospital in Nairobi. With CMMB, Catena volunteered to help the Roman Catholic Diocese of El Obeid establish the Mother of Mercy Hospital in the Nuba Mountains, which was built in 2007 and first launched its operations in March 2008. Tom has been acting as the director of the hospital and the sole doctor to nearly one million people in the hospital’s catchment area since 2008. In 2018, he was appointed chair of the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative, a position he holds in addition to his activities in Sudan. [wikipedia.org]\nTwitter: @CatenaTom"
