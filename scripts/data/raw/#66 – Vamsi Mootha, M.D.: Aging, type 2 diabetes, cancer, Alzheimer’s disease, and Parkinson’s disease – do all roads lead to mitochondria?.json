  "content": "In this episode, Dr. Vamsi Mootha, an expert in mitochondrial biology and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, shares his breadth of knowledge on the mitochondrion organelle: its history, function, genome architecture, and his research of rare mitochondrial dysfunction. Vamsi is currently focused on finding clinical treatments for the 300-some identified rare mitochondrial disorders, but in this work there is a wealth of potential implications for longevity and chronic disease. In this conversation, Vamsi elucidates how the latest research could give insight into conditions related to aging, including but not limited to Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, cancer, and much more. We also explore some of the most exciting potential therapies for mitochondrial diseases such as hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), how exercise affects the mitochondria, the use of hyperbaric chambers for cancer therapy, and the mechanisms by which metformin might confer longevity benefits in a non-diabetic individual. \nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#66 - Vamsi Mootha, M.D.: Aging, type 2 diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease – do all roads lead to mitochondria?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#66 - Vamsi Mootha, M.D.: Aging, type 2 diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease – do all roads lead to mitochondria?\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#66 - Vamsi Mootha, M.D.: Aging, type 2 diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease – do all roads lead to mitochondria?\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nThe Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard [8:00];\nVamsi’s academic background [10:30];\nAdvice for college students and med students considering a career in medicine and/or medical research [15:30];\nVamsi’s focus on mitochondria and mitochondrial disorders [20:00];\nThe mitochondrial genome: Lineage, endosymbiosis, and reductive evolution [23:15];\nHow many diseases can be attributed to mitochondrial mutations?

If you don’t go through all of medical school, if you don’t learn anatomy, if you don’t learn histology, if you don’t learn cardiovascular physiology, it’s a bit tough”\n\nThere are two junctures:\n\nAt the college juncture and interested in medical research: Is there a benefit to doing an MD? \nAt the post-medical school juncture and want to pursue research: Is there a benefit to doing a residency? \n\n\nThe guidance\n\n In college and undecided about medical school, lean towards a PhD\nGoing to medical school is one of the best ways to understand human physiology \nIn medical school and presumably at least somewhat interested in medicine still, do an internal medicine residency\n\nAt least do an internship in order to have a license and can prescribe medicine \n\n\n\n\n\n“And one of my advisers actually said to at least do an internship because then you’ll be licensed. You can prescribe medicines at that point. And there is something special about caring for patients. There’s something very special about going through the process of residency with your colleagues. And again, you really get to see the human living system at some of its extremes. And so I think it’s a great way of continuing to learn physiology and pharmacology as well”\nVamsi’s focus on mitochondria and mitochondrial disorders [20:00]\n“You’ve seen image of mitochondria in the muscle, it’s just beautiful and there’s just something that really captivated me and I kind of got hooked on that organelle that first semester of medical school”\n\nVamsi no longer sees patient and now focuses on research full time\n\nHe leads a research group that focuses on mitochondria and mitochondrial disorders\nThe long term goal is for his research to impact patients: rather than care for them directly he works to develop new diagnostics and drugs, which will be used in front-line patient treatment\n\n\nHe was drawn to the organelle as a first-year medical student\n\n A lecture on myopathies (muscular diseases) in a medical school histology and pathology class brought to his attention that there is a rare form of myopathies that are due to mutations in the mitochondrial DNA \nHe found a book on the mitochondria organelle on the bookshelf at his dad’s cousin’s house where he spent the night and started reading it \n\n\n\nThe mitochondrial genome: Lineage, endosymbiosis, and reductive evolution [23:15]\n\nHow did these bacteria find their way into the eukaryotic cell?\n\nThe bacteria organism had a full electron transport chain and was likely capable of doing aerobic metabolism using oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor \nThe current theory of origin is a process known as  endosymbiosis: a bacteria organism resembling a modern gram-negative rods (a bacteria shaped like a rod that is gram-negatively stained for identification) that merged with a modern-day archaea species \nThe hypothesis is that the bacteria merged with modern-day archaea, giving rise to eukaryotes with a nuclei (three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryote), around 1.5 billion years ago\n\n\nEndosymbiosis (the merging of bacteria and archaea) of the mitochondrion only took place once \n\nThe theory proposes that the bacteria electron transport chain was similar to that of present-day mitochondria \nAlmost all eukaryotes have mitochondria and the DNA analysis of those mitochondria support the theory that it was a monophyletic event\nComparatively, the chloroplast in a plant arose through serial endosymbiosis – which took place at least two independent times in evolution\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8881\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-1-1024x578.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"578\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-1-1024x578.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-1-300x169.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-1-768x433.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-1.png 1422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 1.

[28:45]\n13 proteins of the mitochondria function and mutation\n\nThe mitochondrial genome encodes two ribosomal RNAs, 22 tRNAs and then 13 proteins\nThere is a good sense of the function of each mitochondrial protein\nThere are about 250 different syndromes (particular mutation associated with a clinical phenotype) of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)\n\n That number of mutation only refers to mitochondrial DNA disorders \n\n\nThere is not a solid understanding of whether mtDNA mutations have a higher or lower frequency on a probability basis (with 16,000 base pairs) compared to the nuclear genome\nThere is ascertainment bias in clinical medicine regarding mitochondrial disease \nMitochondrial disease is largely attributed to maternal inheritance  \nmtDNA is smaller and easy to sequence\n\nThe nuclear genome was sequenced in 2001 but the mitochondrial DNA was sequenced 20 years earlier in 1981\nFrom 1988 when the first two papers (1, 2) were published, reporting first mtDNA mutations with the disease phenotype, it has been relatively easy to sequence it and its associated mutations \nThat is why there is about 250 of the mtDNA mutation clinical phenotype mappings\n\n\nComparatively, the research community has identified about 300 genes in the nuclear genome that underlie mtDNA disorders (since 2001)\n\nBut then there are different allelic variants as well \n\n\n\nNuclear DNA and mtDNA: Roles, interaction, communication, and biogenesis [31:30]\n\nBeginning soon after the sequencing of the human genome, it was understood that the human genome encodes about 22,000 proteins\nThe question became: which of the nuclear DNA proteins find their way into the mitochondria?\n\nAbout 1,100 proteins that are made by the nuclear genome find their way into the mitochondrion\nThose 1,100 proteins have to work with the 13 mtDNA proteins within the organelle\n\n\n\nBiogenesis: mtDNA and nuclear DNA communication in the mitochondrion\n\nSome mechanisms are known and many are not\nFor example, in response to exercise there is a transcriptional program response \n\nwithin the organelle, replication factors turn on in the organelle that essentially says: “make more of the nuclear DNA components, mitochondrial DNA components and mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins”\nThe transcription program increases mitochondrial density in a given cell\nWithin a myocyte (muscle cell), physiologic-level signalling instruct a cell to make more DNA in response to exercise \n\n\nOne important signal that induces mitochondrial biogenesis is AMP kinase: change in the ATP:ADP ratio \n\nThere is sensing of ATP:ADP ratio decrease that promotes an increase in AMPK activity \n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8882\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-2-1-979x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"979\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-2-1-979x1024.png 979w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-2-1-287x300.png 287w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-2-1-768x804.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-2-1.png 1168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px\" />\nFigure 2.

Image credit: cellsignal.com\n\nIt is still an open question as to how exactly the number of mitochondria is sensed and regulated but some of the inputs have been identified \nMetformin administration activates AMPK but that does not necessarily mean that mitochondrial density is altered \nThis is because AMP activation is an important signal for mitochondrial biogenesis but it is not sufficient \nSome other mitochondrial biogenesis signals (aside from exercise):\n\nCalcium\nDisease states in which there is a massive proliferation of malfunctioning mitochondria\nAndrogens and testosterone can influence the amount of mitochondria (see Vamsi’s 2005 study on how androgens and testosterone can influence mitochondrial density)\nNutrients: NAD is an important signal\n\n Transcriptional cofactor PGA-1α regulates mitochondria biogenesis\nSIRT1, which utilizes NAD as a cofactor directly affects PGC-1α activity through deacetylation\nFor more on how NAD is used as a substrate in certain chemical reactions, checkout a previous episode of The Drive with David Sinclair (specifically starting at 31:00)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich cells have the most mitochondrial DNA? And how often does mitochondria turn-over in a cell? [37:30]\n\nTalking about the number of mitochondria in a muscle cell, for example, is ambiguous because they are not quantal units\nMitochondria constantly undergo fusion and fission so there can be a different “number” of mitochondria in a cell \nMtDNA, on the other hand, is a quantal unit \n\nmitochondrial genomes per nuclear genome in a cell type can be quantified \nA fibroblast, for example, have a few hundred to 1,000 copies of the mitochondrial genome for each copy of its nuclear genome, but there is a lot of variation  \nThe cell type with the highest number of copies of the mitochondrial genome is the unfertilized egg – it has half a million copies of mitochondrial DNA \nSperm has up to a few hundred mtDNA \nRed blood cells have no mtDNA \n\n\nThe mitochondrial turnover dynamics of dividing and nondividing cells are different \n\nIn most non-dividing tissues (e.g muscles and neurons), the half-life of mitochondria is on the order of a few days\n A dividing cell needs to double the number of mitochondria then partition the replication and repeat\n\n\n\nDoes ALL of your mitochondrial DNA come from your mother? [40:00]\n\nThe textbook teaching is that mtDNA is transmitted exclusively via maternal lineage\nMechanistically, mtDNA is passed on from mom to child for two primary reasons\n\n\nmaternal mtDNA grossly outnumbers paternal mtDNA \n\nThis is due to sexual dimorphism: by sheer dilution (because the egg is so huge – having millions of copies of mtDNA compared to sperm mtDNA that has few hundred copies), it’s difficult for the dad’s mtDNA to get transmitted\n\n\npaternal mtDNA are actively destroyed after fertilization \n\nSperm mtDNA are encoded by ubiquitin, which marks them for active elimination once fertilized inside of the egg \n\n\n\n\nHowever, in a rare exception, one case report of a biopsy  reported mtDNA molecules of an individual with two differential haplotypes and concluded paternal mtDNA transmission\nAnother paper claimed a few families in which mtDNA paternal transmission occurred\n While paternal mtDNA transmission is a rare event, it is an active area of research\n If the results are not a technical artifact, there is an opportunity to learn about the mechanisms of maternal transmission \n\nMitochondria 101: The powerhouse of the cell, electron transport chain, and the NADH/NAD ratio [44:00]\n“I like to think of the mitochondria as being the key place where there’s energy transformations. So in order for a cell to work, it needs energy, but in the same way that, in order to live our lives, we need to have one type of battery for our iPhone, a different type of battery for a laptop, a different type of battery for our automobile. We need energy packaged in different ways. So this is sort of the charm of the mitochondria”\n\nThe mitochondria is the key place where energy transformations take place\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8883\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-3-928x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"928\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-3-928x1024.png 928w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-3-272x300.png 272w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-3-768x847.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-3.png 1108w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px\" />\nFigure 3.

The electron transport chain is a series of electron transporters embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane that shuttles electrons from NADH and FADH2 to molecular oxygen, using  a proton pump to create a proton gradient across a membrane. In the process, protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, and oxygen is reduced to form water.

You could have proton motive force. And then you can dissipate that battery to basically catalyze the formation of ATP, which most people know is the energy form that used to power muscle when you exercise.

This is why there is an oxygen gradient in the cell\nIn certain skeletal tissues, like skeletal muscle and the heart, there are oxygen carriers like myoglobin \nThe final pathway of the electron transport chain utilizes oxygen to generate water and CO2 which have to exit the mitochondria and out of the cell \n\nMitochondrial pathogenesis:\n\nIt may not be just about ATP production… it’s also about excess, unused oxygen\nOne of the consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction is excess, unused oxygen\nIf a mitochondrion is failing to do its job, oxygen utilization will be failing\nThey hypothesis is that some of the excess, unused oxygen contributes to the pathology seen in some of the rare mitogenic diseases\n\nDioxygen toxicity\nHypothesis: Enzymes are programed to operate within an oxygen range inside of the cell.

[1:27:00]\nIf the aging inflammatory phenotype is not beneficial, could preventing or rejuvenating broken mitochondria slow the aging process?\n\nExercise is one of the best ways to turn over bad mitochondria and induce mitochondrial biogenesis \nBut exercise does a lot of things, so positive mitochondrial impact does not adequately answer the aging-mitochondrial health relationship \n\nIs there an optimal exercise strategy for mitochondrial health?\nAt the center of the optimal exercise question is understanding the role of exercise in mitochondrial health\n\nThree types of (loose) exercise buckets being \n\n\nstrength training\naerobic training requiring maximum mitochondrial output with minimal generation of lactate\nanaerobic training that demands ATP and favors the lactate production pathway \n\nMore about exercise…\n\nEach form of exercise are beneficial but it is hard to differentiate cardiometabolic benefit versus protective due to other factors associated with a given age profile (frailty, for example, in older age guarded against with weight-bearing exercise)\nQuantity and quality of exercise also matters\nAs it pertains to exercise, Peter is most interested in understanding how exercise can be optimally tailored, or prescribed, to impact all causes of mortality \nAlthough the proven relationship is not yet clear, there are predicted non-linear dynamics of mitochondria as a function of both age and exercise\n\nSuspending use of skeletal muscle leads to lean mass and mitochondria loss:\nMeasurable VO2 max degradation after 10 days of hospitalized bed rest, which takes about six weeks to recover\n\n\nThe programs that turn on mitochondria during exercise are elaborate\n\n 17 different inputs into the system through exercise may all be necessary, with the right dynamics, and the right off rates to induce mitobiogenesis \nThe ragged-red fiber of muscle disorders represents an accumulation of poorly functioning mitochondria\n\nOnly a two to three of necessary inputs may be adequate to produce more malfunctioning mitochondria, but all 17 inputs may be necessary to produce healthy mitochondria\n\n\n\n\nThe PGC-1 alpha program turns on mitochondrial biogenesis while simultaneously turns on autophagy programs – turning over bad mitochondria while creating more healthy mitochondria\nMany diseases are ultimately reduced by exercise \n\nWhat autophagy means in the context of mitochondria [1:36:15]\n\nWith proper exercise regimes, there have been observed transcriptional programs with multiple inputs that will turn on all 1,000 proteins to produce more mitochondria and induce old mitochondrial turnover\nSupporting the complicated dynamics of mitobiogenesis, a study finding revealed that antioxidants in conjunction with exercise erases some of the beneficial effects of exercise\n\nThe study concluded that ROS play an important role in mitobiogenesis signaling and also turning over old mitochondria that are not beneficial \nSimilarly, and as discussed with Nav Chandel, ROS plays an important role in selectively targeting a cancer cell, so blocking ROS with antioxidants in a cancer patient would be detrimental \n\n\n\nMetformin’s impact on exercise and lactate levels [1:40:15]\n\nAs discussed with Nir Barzilai,individuals with diabetes and also those who are insulin resistant are benefited by metformin\nNir’s work with TAME looks at the effect of taking metformin on non-diabetic, non-insulin resistant individuals \n\n⇒ For more on TAME check out a previous episode of The Drive with Nir Barzilai (specifically starting at 57:00)\n\nPeter self-experiments to observe the effects of metformin on exercise \n\nHis lactate performance curve (LPC) comparison reveals higher lactate levels when on metformin\nHis resting lactate level on Metformin also increased\nHypothesis for increased lactate \n\nMetformin inhibits complex one, the body may preferentially opt against shuttling pyruvate into the mitochondria, disproportionately keeping pyruvate outside of the organelle and turning it into lactate\n\n\nRather than using blood in the finger to measure lactate, Vamsi suggests metabolics\nThe next comparison to observe is what metformin does to lactate level performance in a diabetic or insulin resistant individual compared to their baseline\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8892\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"713\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-12.png 713w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/vamsi-figure-12-300x181.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px\" />\nFigure 12.

[1:48:15]\n\nWhen Complex I is blocked, the body senses it and there is a homeostatic response \nBlocking the Complex may turn on 15 of the 17 inputs needed to induce mitobiogenesis and other parts of the cell as well \nExperiments (1,2,3) in worms did RNAi screens to look for genes that would lead to a longevity phenotype when disrupted\n\nOne of the gene sets most associated with a longevity phenotype was the mitochondrial electron transport chain \nHowever, one of the gene sets associated with a reduced lifespan was the mitochondria electron transport chain\nThe subsets were distinct – 90 genes total are required for the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation\n\n\n\nWhy do the loss of some genes lead to longevity and others lead to decreased lifespan?\n\nOne hypothesis has to do with the strength of the allele: gently blocking the ETC (as metformin may do) rather than significantly inhibiting the ETC encoding\nmetformin may block the ETC such that it elicits a homeostatic response that is net adaptive \nVamsi submits that metformin is beneficial for a subset of the population who have type 2 diabetes\nThere are rare cases with drugs related to metformin, like Phenoformin, that can result in fatal lactic acidosis \nAn experiment evaluating the cross product of exercise and metformin – like that similar to the Ron Kahn study – would help inform whether the addition of metformin offers incremental benefit or counteracts the benefit of optimized exercise, sleep, and nutrition\\\n\nHypoxia as a potential therapeutic option for mitochondrial disease [1:52:45]\n\nThere have been observations where too much oxygen can be damaging \nIn some rare mitochondrial disorders studied\n\n ATP levels are defended by glycolysis (i.e., not a disorder of energy deficiency) \nthere are high levels of unused oxygen observed (despite high energy output a high level of oxygen returns to the lungs)\n\n\nVamsi’s lab now investigates ways to limit or reduce the delivery of oxygen \n\nUsing hypoxia chambers in mouse model studies in which air is diluted with nitrogen (21% oxygen reduced to 11%)\nIn some of the models with mitochondrial disease there has been a measured benefit \nIn an example: \n\nA mouse model with Leigh syndrome (a recessive loss of one of the nuclear subunits of Complex I) has an archetype disease process observed\n\nMouse is born looking healthy \nWithin 30-35 days begins to display symptoms\nBy day 55, among other symptoms, it has lesions on the brain MRI and the initial cause of death is probably brain driven, although other tissues are also affected\n\n\nIf the mice were grown at 11% rather than 21%, they survive to a median of one year (half of their normal, 2-year lifespan) and looked well\n\n\n\n\nPreviously, hyperbaric oxygen has been proposed as a treatment for mitochondrial rejuvenation \n\nVamsi’s lab experimented with hyperoxia conditions as well \n\n55% oxygen conditions, as is the saturation in an operating room\nThe mice with Leigh Syndrome die within a few days of exposure\n\n\nThere have been some anecdotes that suggest high oxygen levels on a broken electron transport chain can be very damaging, in line with the experimental findings in mice\n\n\n\n“I think there’s some anecdotes that suggest that super high oxygen levels on a broken electron transport chain can be very damaging in humans.”\nCancer prevention and treatment: hyperbaric oxygen chambers, targeting single carbon metabolism of the mitochondria, and more [2:00:00]\n\nThere is a subset of tumors – where there may be mitochondrial mutations to begin with – for which Vamsi’s lab is exploring hyperoxic exposure\nHyperbaric oxygen has been proposed as a cancer therapy in the past \n\nthere have been mixed signals of efficacy \nIt may be that with precise targeting, (based on mitochondria markers) hyperbaric oxygen can be effectively used for certain cancer treatments\n\n\n\n⇒ For more on targeted cancer treatment check out a previous episode of The Drive with Keith Flaherty (specifically starting at 1:12:00)\nOther learnings that could be applied to cancer prevention or treatment\n\nA series of projects in Vamsi’s lab took data sets from cancers to see which metabolic pathways were consistently altered \n\nThere are about 1500 metabolic enzymes in the human genome\nRevealed a few mitochondrial enzymes in the folate pathways that are consistently upregulated across all cancers (also found to be the case in research conducted by David Sabbitini, Josh Rabbinowitz)\n\nSuggests that mitochondria are not being utilized for energy in cancer but acts as biosynthetic machines for cancer\nFindings consistent with the hypothesis that the Warburg effect is the result of a cancer cell favoring a throughput of substrate rather than an inability to undergo oxidative phosphorylation\n\n\n\n\nIt is an open ended question if targeting single carbon metabolism of the mitochondria will be beneficial in cancer treatment, but it is an upregulated pathway in cancer states\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8893\"
