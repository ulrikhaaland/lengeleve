(source, source, source) However, these cohort study approximations. \n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14535\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/visceral-fat-ama17.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"822\" height=\"673\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/visceral-fat-ama17.png 822w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/visceral-fat-ama17-300x246.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/visceral-fat-ama17-768x629.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" />\nFigure 4.
