[5:30]\nLipids\n\nTriglycerides (TGs): reference is < 150 mg/dL (< 1.7 mmol/L)\n\nPeter wants this < 100 mg/dL (< 1.13 mmol/L)\nMore stringent, but something Peter likes to see: TG < HDL-C (when measured in mg/dL)\n\n\nLDL-P: < 1,000 nmol/L (~ 20th percentile)\nSmall LDL-P: < 500 nmol/L (~ 25th percentile)\n\nWhy so low? The reason is heart disease and atherosclerotic disease are the most ubiquitous causes of death, so why would you want to be average?\nFor more on lipids, LDL-P, and LDL-C, listen to the podcasts with Ron Krauss, Dave Feldman, and Tom Dayspring:\n\nRon Krauss, M.D.: a deep dive into heart disease (EP.03)\nDave Feldman: stress testing the lipid energy model (EP.19)\nTom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part I of V: an introduction to lipidology (EP.20)\nTom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part II of V: Lipid metrics, lipid measurements, and cholesterol regulation (EP.21)\nTom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part III of V: HDL, reverse cholesterol transport, CETP inhibitors, and apolipoproteins (EP.22)\nTom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part IV of V: statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, niacin, cholesterol and the brain (EP.23)\nTom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part V of V: Lp(a), inflammation, oxLDL, remnants, and more (EP.24)\n\nInflammation and oxidation markers: high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) and oxidized LDL (oxLDL)\n\nhsCRP: < 1 mg/L (labs say below 2)\noxLDL: < 40 U/L (labs say < 60 U/L)\n\nMetabolic\n\nUric acid: < 5.0 mg/dL (labs say < 6-7 because they are optimizing for not getting gout)\n\nLiver function tests: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)\n\nALT: < 20 U/L and (reference upper limit: 42-44) and AST 40 but Peter wants patients below 20\nAST: < 20 U/L (reference upper limit: 40)\n\nOGTT (oral glucose tolerance test)\n\nFasting glucose < 90 mg/dL\nFasting insulin < 6 (uIU/mL)\n\n1-hour glucose: < 130*\n1-hour insulin: < 30*\n\n2-hour glucose: < 100\n2-hour insulin: < 20\n\n\n\n\n\n* For a woman who is smaller, or less muscular, he will tolerate slightly higher levels\nHormones\nThyroid — TSH [thryoid stimulating hormone], free T3 [triiodothyronine] (fT3), reverse T3 (rT3), T4 [thyroxine] — these need to be taken in context\n\nIf one or more of those are out of whack, how do you even begin to make the diagnosis of hypothyroid, for example?\nTSH is really only telling you about what the pituitary gland is seeing as far as the T4 to T3 conversion (which is telling you about the deiodinase in the brain that’s making that distinction)\nfT3 is telling you how much peripheral T4 is converting to T3\nrT3 is telling you how much peripheral T4 is converting to rT3, which opposes T3\nEach of those have a completely different cause, but a whiteboard is in order to explain this (will likely a video at some point for people interested)\n\nSex hormones:\n\nDHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone)\nFSH (follicle stimulating hormone)\nLH (luteinizing hormone)\nDHT (dihydrotestosterone)\nProgesterone\nSHBG (sex hormone binding globulin)\nEstrogen (estrone [E1], estradiol [E2], estriol [E3])\n\nThis is also very complex (another whiteboard/video discussion at a later time)\nAbout nine things we measure\nOmega-3s: EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) & DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)\n\nAlso very complex\nLikes to see EPA/DHA index above 8.5\nUsed to think 8.0, but sometimes OK with up to 10-12, if no side effects (e.g., nosebleeds)\nMore complicated, for some patients you want to see DHA higher than the EPA\nWhat you’re optimizing for: neurodegenerative (DHA) or atherosclerosis (EPA is more important)\nAlso matters: your sources of these things (e.g., supplements, food)\n\nCholesterol synthesis and absorption biomarkers\n\nDesmosterol (synthesis)\nCampesterol, sitosterol, cholestanol (absorption)\n\nPeter likes to use these markers to assess therapeutic options, and he’s concerned about oversuppression of cholesterol synthesis at the individual level (desmosterol is a way to gauge this)\nIGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1)\n\nChanged his mind over time\nUsed to think low is best (i.e., below 50th percentile)\nIt’s likely that cycling between low and high levels of IGF-1 is optimal\nFasting can dramatically lower IGF-1\n\nThree things that impact IGF-1 most:\n\nAmino acid intake (methionine)\nInsulin levels (largely dietary carbs)\nExogenous hormones (e.g., growth hormone, an analog of the human pituitary gland to make more IGF-1)\n\nBob says, when looking at IGF-1 as a marker, that is a snapshot, but we’re really living in a movie where it goes up and down at different periods, and that’s not captured on a single blood draw\n\nBob points out in Valter Longo’s FMD studies in mice, you see shrinking of organs during FMD and low IGF-1, but then the regeneration/rejuvenation occurs upon refeeding, your IGF-1 levels are likely to come back up at this time\nIf you are cycling through periods of feast and famine, and you get an annual IGF-1 blood test, you’re looking at an average, when what you may want to capture is the variability that the cycling induces — we may be looking for punctuated periods of low IGF-1, with recovery that necessitates relatively higher levels of IGF-1\nPeter says IGF is more stable, than GH (which is more dynamic), so don’t measure GH (e.g., sit in a sauna for 20 minutes, it will change your GH but not your IGF-1)\n\nWhat aspect of women’s health is the least studied/understood? [21:15]\nMost important distinction is sex hormones\n\nMen have gradual decline in hormones, like a frog in hot water, doesn’t notice it as much\nWomen, on the other hand, have a more stark drop off\nWomen, during reproductive years, menstrual cycle experiencing profound fluctuations in hormones\nLosing estrogen, progesterone and testosterone\nMen have about 15 ng/L and women have about 1 ng/L, however, testosterone is still the dominant hormone in women\nIn menopause all the hormones kind of stop suddenly\nPeter’s pet peeve is doctors that disregard perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms in women, “Without having ever read a single study or limits in the methodologies of the Women’s Health Initiative but still come to the conclusion that women should never take hormones and just deal with it”\n\nThere’s something about multiple pregnancies and the HPA axis in women\n\nHaving two kids, he doesn’t see it\nBut having 3-4 kids, unlikely that her thyroid will bounce back to normal\nEnergy levels are super low and can’t get it back\nThey have normal TSH typically, but peripherally metabolism of T4 is very altered\nYou can make interventions which will help immediately feel a lot better, yet they in many cases will just fall through the cracks… due to just a failure to appreciate these subtle differences between men and women\n\nBob mentions a Freakonomics podcast episode, there was the thalidomide issue, where women were taking the drug while pregnant (for morning sickness), and led to a lot of fetal deaths and birth defects, and led to fewer studies of women\n\nBecause of the effects on young women and on the fetus, it suggested that women shouldn’t be included in clinical trials because of the potential adverse events to the fetus\nAfter this period, women were studied far less than men, they were excluded from early clinical trials for new drugs\n\nAnother difference: women get less cardiovascular disease\n\nPeter says is you normalize for all common factors such as LDL-P, apoB, blood pressure, etc., all things equal, they indeed get less cardiovascular disease\nYou would have to look at iron levels\nIn men, the more metabolically deranged, the better they do with therapeutic phlebotomy, but the less deranged they are, the less they are affected by giving blood, and therefore reducing the oxidative stress of iron\nIt might be the case that women may have less iron than a man due to the menstrual cycle and this hypothesis is something Peter would be interested to know more about\n\nWomen get more Alzheimer’s disease\n\n2 out of 3 cases of Alzheimer’s are women but the reason for this needs to be studied more\nPeter says some people try to say it’s because women live longer, but doesn’t think the increase in longevity accounts for the number of women compared to men getting AD\n\nWomen get less cancer in the US\nWomen live longer than men\nWhat are your thoughts on fasting and ketosis for females? [31:30]\nWomen need to be thoughtful about a couple things:\n\nFertility issues, or trying to get pregnant, can’t make a compelling case that a woman should be in nutritional ketosis\nDavid Mangelsdorf looked at differences in male and female brain in the presence of changing FGF21 levels\nLong story short, “In a calorie restricted state, when ketones are elevated, it suppresses FSH and LH in women but not in men”\nSuper interesting because profound evolutionary “in a period of famine, you would want women to stop reproducing, you would want to shut off FSH and LH, you would want men to have no impairment on their T level” because they’re trying to get food\nIt’s certainly possible to get pregnant in ketosis but the question is how are you optimizing?\nThe other part of this is should women who are pregnant be in ketosis?\nClearly evolved to be able to handle this, however, is it optimal?\nAs a general rule, not convinced it’s the best strategy: far better strategy is don’t eat junk food, less sugar, etc.\n\nAdvice for medical students and residents, how to get through it, and optimize their time while in med school [38:00]\nMost key advice: Don’t study pre-med in college\n\nAll that stuff is like JV version of med school, and you’ll get the full version in med school\nPick a major that you freaking love because the last thing you want to do is study a major with the sole purpose of passing the MCAT\n\nOnce you’re in med school\n\nBe prepared to be super unhappy during some days\nPeter, for example, hated to memorize things but realized you just can’t get through it on first principles and he finally accepted that you had to get a base knowledge\nPeter was once given some very wise advice: Anytime you find yourself in a situation that you think sucks, go find someone who would give anything to be in your situation and help them out\n\nMaintain a balance\n\nIt is important to get out of those books for a while and do something pleasant\nProbably better off only studying 85 hours instead of 100, for instance, and use those other 15 hours to enjoy life for a minute\n\nFinally, don’t lose sight of why you’re doing it\n\nInteract with as many patients you can because it’ll help you realize you have this bizarre privilege of hearing about people’s issues\nSo as a med student, if you aren’t awe inspired by interactions with patients you might want to consider a change in profession because you’ll be beaten down by the rest of it\n\nWhat is Peter’s opinion on the best way to monetize a podcast to make it sustainable? [47:45]\n\nFirst, Peter has really enjoyed this podcast process more than he thought\nInitially felt like “I have to” do this\nNow thinks he “gets to” do this\nHowever, it’s not cheap, costs roughly $2,500 per podcast not including Peter’s time\nNeed to figure out how to pay for this because 1) not cool to flush $120,000 yearly and 2) Peter wants to be able to do so stuff if podcast can not only pay for itself but also to fund some of the research so that would be a great\nJust hired a 6th researcher, wants to hire as many as possible\nClinical practice subsidizing the cost of the research team, all under Attia Medical\nWould like to figure out a way for the podcast to 1) cover the cost of research, and 2) wishful that it will also generate a pool of capital to invest in types of research he wants to see at universities\n\nSo, what are the options for monetizing a podcast?\nSell ads: doesn’t want to sell ads\nListener-Support Model\n\nSam Harris does this and has been helping Peter think through a listener-support model, Sam explains his rationale for this on his podcast\nRhonda Patrick is also listener support model but different than Sam’s\n\nSubscription/Member-only network, Netflix model, so you pay to have access to the network\n\nMonetization of the podcast will likely be one of these two rather than running ads\nBob: “I have nothing to add”\nAt Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder’s meetings, Munger lets Buffett answer the questions, often times commenting, “I have nothing to add.”\n\nWhat are you looking to achieve and monitor with your blood glucose monitor? [57:15]\n\nCGM, the G6\nAlso loves the Oura Ring\nOnly two products he cannot stop wearing\n\nRegarding hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):\n\n“Directionally tolerable but mostly shit”\nHe knows bc he’s used CGM in so many patients and compared reports to A1c and you realize that A1c is at the mercy of the fact that a red blood cell lives for 90-120 days\n\nThoughts on lithium supplementation? [1:08:15]\n\nPeter says that the evidence that groundwater containing higher levels of lithium is contributing to better mental health is as good as any such data can be which is to say “not great” (Tier 2 epidemiology)\nPeter calls it “Tier 2 epidemiology”, which is a step up from the absolute worst epidemiology, which is when you are trying to assess inputs and outputs such as “people who exercise this way tend to live this long” or . . . “people who eat this way have this much disease”\nLithium observations are tier 2 epidemiology because one of the variables is fixed, and there’s no healthy user bias, you’re just measuring the mental health\nWhen you overlay the groundwater map with mental health there’s actually a nice association\nNo doubt you could think of other explanations (could be a proxy for something else) but all that said, at the first order, there is no obvious proxy\n\nPeter experimented on himself to see if taking lithium would stabilize his mood\n\nNote: Don’t EVER do this outside of the care of a “super dialed in physician”\nFirst consulted with Paul Conti, a psychiatrist who uses lithium in monotherapy for high-risk bipolar patients who don’t respond well (or at all) to the common bipolar drugs\nPeter was taking 600 mg/day (about half what a bipolar patient would take)\nDid this for about a year, didn’t tell anyone, because he figured that if there truly were noticeable differences and wanted to see if others noticed on their own\nThe first person to notice was Peter’s wife, she noticed after 4 months\nWhen Peter asked how she knew, her response was, “You’re less of an asshole”\nPeter decided not to continue to take a mega dose of lithium (he did notice some side effects such as nausea)\nPeter now takes low dose 10-20 mg lithium\nHe categorizes this as “probably not harmful, [but] not sure how much value I’m getting out of it”\n\nInsights about berberine? [1:16:00]\nBerberine, a plant-derived extract with 2 properties\nFirst, it is a weak activator of AMP kinase (the “secret sauce” of Metformin is that it activates AMP kinase)\n\nOTC dose is generally 500-1000 2x per day (similar to Metformin)\nThe net effect is decreasing hepatic glucose output, “poor man’s version of Metformin”\nNot that exciting for Peter, just use metformin\n\nSecondly, the more exciting piece is that it is a weak inhibitor of the enzyme, PCSK9\n\nWord on the street, it probably only works in a subset of people who overexpress PCSK9 (an enzyme [technically a proprotein convertase: it acts more like a chaperone than a catalytic enzyme] that degrades LDL receptors) which ends up in higher LDL-P (only about 5% of the time will this be the reason someone isn’t clearing LDL particles, there are literally thousands of possible reasons)\nThese patients respond well to berberine\n\nFor more on PCSK9, see the following episodes of The Drive: Ron Krauss, Dave Feldman, and Tom Dayspring (Part IV)\nWhy does Peter take a baby aspirin? What does the science say? [1:19:20]\nPeter has recently changed his thinking on this topic (more below)\n\nBut the reason he was doing so is that heart disease is rampant in Peter’s family so he is simply trying to mitigate risk\nQuote from Charlie Munger, “All I want to know is where I’m going to die so I never go there”\nBaby aspirin has some effect on inflammation, but the majority of the benefit is on platelets, therefore reducing thrombotic events (blood clot), which can be the final moment where you have an MI\n\nWhat has changed about Peter’s view recently?\n\nA month ago, his view was . . . if your “Aspirin Works Test” is positive (test in urine that measures metabolites of platelets to predict which patients will respond to baby Aspirin) combined with at least one other factor that indicates possible heart disease, he would recommend taking it\nThere are side effects to be considered, easier bruising, bleeding, a small risk of ulcer, etc.\nStudy that came out recently that looked at relatively low-risk populations, found that the risk of taking baby aspirin was small, but so was the benefit, making it a “wash” in Peter’s mind\nNow he’s just a little less likely to suggest (this especially to low risk patients)\n\nWill Peter stop taking it? Perhaps, even though it makes sense intuitively, the data simply don’t support it\nHow do you use HR variability as a metric in your practice and/or in your own personal use? Sleep, pre/post exercise, pre/post eating, every morning readiness? [1:23:25]\nHRV\nHRV measures the specific changes in time (i.e., variability) between successive heartbeats.\nThe raw measurement is the interbeat interval (IBI): IBI is used in reference to the time interval between individual beats of the heart.\n<img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/null-177.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"381\" height=\"374\" />\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of normal ECG.\nFrom there, HRV can be expressed in 2 domains: time or frequency. The Oura ring shows time domain, which is expressed in raw RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive RR Differences).\n<img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/null-178.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"377\" height=\"282\" />\nFigure 2. RR interval. The RMSSD looks at the successive RR differences.\nFrequency-domain methods: frequency domain methods assign bands of frequency and then count the number of RR intervals that match each band.\n\nThe bands are typically high frequency (HF) from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz,\nlow frequency (LF) from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz,\nand the very low frequency (VLF) from 0.0033 to 0.04 Hz (Wikipedia, accessed 9/8/18)\n\nOura doesn’t show frequency domains because they claim that the low-frequency to high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio often does not accurately measure cardiac sympathovagal balance (personal communication; Billman, 2013). Also, different programs may use different scales to define LF vs HF, which may also skew the results. Oura does claim that it could provide an accurate measure of sympathovagal balance because of the high precision of the IBI measurement from the ring (personal communication).\n\nWill Eden, works for Peter Thiel, got Peter into HR variability long before all these wearables came out tracking it\nSix years ago, spent a day at Peter Thiel’s office and was showed data from HeartMath, algorithm on chest straps\n\nFor more on high frequency vs. low frequency HR variability, see the episode of The Drive with Robert Lustig\n\nWith Oura ring, recovery index, looking at HRV\nPeter says, alcohol and shitty food close to bedtime will drive HR way up, and HRV way down, which diminishes your recovery and sleep quality\nHRV with temperature and movement feeds an algorithm in Oura that predicts sleep quality\n\nIs it actionable? What is valuable about knowing HRV?\nNeed to know two things:\n1. Real-time feedback\n\nHard to do anything without it\nIf your HRV is off in the morning when you wake up you can immediately ask what did I do differently?\nPeter knows he can only have one drink\nMeal timing, room temperature are factors\nCan tinker with stuff to try to improve sleep quality\n\n2. “Readiness” score\n\nNot as sensitive to lifting workouts\nA couple of teams in the Tour de France wore Oura and Peter would love to see the data because their “recovery scores must’ve been the lowest numbers imaginable”\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5580\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_5142-169x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"711\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_5142-169x300.png 169w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_5142-576x1024.png 576w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_5142.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" />\nFigure 3.

Screenshot of the Oura app.\nFasting and sleep\n\nBob asks how fasting affects PA’s sleep and what the Oura ring told him\nThe biggest thing was deep sleep (stage 3 and 4) went up the most\nLight slight (stage 1 and 2) went down the most\nREM was unchanged\nHRV was higher\nResting HR was on par with what it is if you’re not eating and drinking before bed\nRespiratory Rate went down\n\n** Speed round begins, Peter has 90 seconds to answer each question [1:38:15] **\nWith the emergence of “the coconut oil is pure poison” article, can you shed some light on saturated fat in the literature and the types of studies done specifically on coconut oil? [1:38:45]\nCoconut oil is pure poison?\n\nThe literature is ridiculous\nNutritional epidemiology is the lowest form of human inference\nThat said, the case for saturated fat may be overstated, the view that it is never harmful and eating 90% of saturated fat can’t be healthy for everyone\nRather than rely on some “knucklehead” study, Peter suggests that we “learn to understand what the biomarkers are that changes as a result of [consuming saturated fat],” meaning inflammation, lipoproteins, and lipids\n\nWould you discuss the recent meta studies that claim that moderate carbohydrate intake may be best for health? [1:40:45]\nThe meta study: Dietary carbohydrate intake and mortality: a prospective cohort study and meta-analysis\nPeter says that the paper suffers from all the problems of nutritional epidemiology, a horrible brand of science\nZoe Harcombe wrote a great article on this which points out that the paper:\n\nDidn’t correct for alcohol consumption\nHas a number of odd confounders\nHazard ratios are quite low\nRisks are discussed in relative terms instead of absolute terms\n\n“You have to know relative risk, you have to know absolute risk, and you have to know the period over time under which the condition was studied relative to the natural course of the illness” \n“It’s that third part that doesn’t get enough attention”\nWhat is the number one recommendation/habit you would suggest every person add to their daily regimen (besides physical activity) for wholesome health? [1:42:45]\nPeter not a huge fan of this type of question\nThe “glib” answer is to:\n\nSleep well\nDo something physical\nDon’t eat for a long period\nWhen you do eat, don’t eat crap\nMeditate\n\nWith that said, “sleep is the one we are going to be most sensitive to”\nLack of good sleep is the one you will “suffer from the quickest”\nWhat does it mean if your body has a harder time getting into ketosis via fasting than it used to (testing using a Precision Xtra)? [1:44:15]\nIf the concern is that the person does not get to the same levels of BHB (beta-hydroxybutyrate), the first two things Peter would consider are the following:\n\nPerhaps they are more efficiently utilizing the ketones (hard to demonstrate outside of a laboratory)\nJust producing less of them due to something different they are doing than what they were doing in the past (changed fatty acid consumption, eating more protein, more carbs)\n\nNote: If testing ketones by way of urine strips, it’s possible that the more fat-adapted a person becomes, the less acetoacetate that will show up in their urine because they are utilizing more of the ketones as a substrate\nWhy are you taking Zetia and Lipitor? Are you mitigating risk based on your APOE4? Or is there something else going on? [1:46:10]\n\nActually not taking it anymore\nSimply stated, he was taking it in the past because he’s trying to live as long as he can, which means delaying the onset of atherosclerotic disease as much as possible\nPeter has an all-hands-on-deck approach defined as:\n\nReducing the burden of lipoproteins\nReducing inflammation\nImproving endothelial health\nIncreasing insulin sensitivity\n\n\nAs for choosing Zetia (ezetimibe) and Lipitor (atorvastatin) specifically: Lipitor, empirically derived, trial and error, found that taking 10 mg 3x per week when coupled with the Zetia, minimum effective dose got Peter to below the 20th percentile\n\nWhat will your book be about and what is the expected release date? [1:47:45]\n\nPlot: Peter’s little known alternate life as a shepherd (wink wink)\nRelease date: Early 2020\n\nWhat are your thoughts on nicotinamide riboside supplementation for longevity? [1:49:30]\n\nCells need NAD, so you could argue having more NAD in a cell is a better thing (second order question)\nBut cells cannot take up NAD, a cell has to be able to make its own\nWith that said, giving precursors is an interesting idea\n\nReferencing the paper in Cell Metabolism by Josh Rabinowitz\n\nThey developed a tracer to track all the intermediaries of NAD and all the precursors\nWhen given oral precursors (NR or NMN), only the liver could take them up and make NAD using tryptophan, no other cell could take it up\nSo if you’re taking oral NR or NMN, you are pretty much just giving it to your liver, not the place you want it to be (not changed by using pterostilbene)\nBased on data, only way to increase cellular NAD would be intravenous doses of NR or NMN\nTaking it orally is probably not harmful, but probably waste of money\n\nFor more on NAD, see episode of The Drive with David Sinclair as well as Dave Asprey’s podcast episode with Charles Brenner\nNote: Bob misspoke about Dave Asprey taking intravenous NR. Dave mentioned in his podcast with Charles Brenner that he took NAD (not NR) intravenously. Here is the exchange, courtesy of Dave Asprey’s blog (and transcript):\nDave Asprey: I’ve got to ask what about just straight out injecting NAD because I’ve had about 15 grams of NAD intravenously. We’re doing it at Bulletproof Labs on occasion. It’s been pretty profound, but I’m taking a gram of NAD in my bloodstream. What’s the difference between nicotinamide riboside and just straight-up doing NAD?\nCharles Brenner: Injecting NAD doesn’t make any sense to me because NAD doesn’t go into cells as NAD.\nWhich brand of supplements have you found to be effective? [1:54:30]\n“Well, the problem is that the whole supplement world is kind of a shit show”\nCompanies Peter relies on for a variety of supplements\n\nJarrow\nPure Encapsulations\n\nFor DHA/EPA\n\nNordic Naturals\nCarlson Labs\n\nFor Berberine: Thorne\nAre you currently accepting new patients? And how do I find a ‘Peter Attia clone’ in my area? [1:56:20]\nNo, not for the remainder of this year, Attia Medical is overbooked\nHow does one find a “Peter Attia clone” in their area?\n\nFor a clone, you can maybe try Toronto attorney, Paul Attia\nYou’re also welcome to seek medical advice from Tom Morello at your own risk\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/null-179.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" />\nFigure 8.
