  "title": "#128 – Irene Davis, Ph.D.: Evolution of the foot, running injuries, and minimalist shoes",
  "content": "Irene Davis is the founding Director of the Spaulding National Running Center at the Harvard Medical School. In this episode, Irene describes how her research of biomechanics and clinical work with running injuries, as well as research by others, has shaped her views on maintaining body alignment and foot health. Irene discusses her argument for the role of modern footwear in running-related injuries and how minimalist footwear helps resolve the subsequent biomechanical issues.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#128 – Irene Davis, Ph.D.: The evolution of the foot, running injuries, and minimalist shoes\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#128 – Irene Davis, Ph.D.: The evolution of the foot, running injuries, and minimalist shoes\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#128 – Irene Davis, Ph.D.: The evolution of the foot, running injuries, and minimalist shoes\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nIrene’s path to her Ph.D., her entry into physical therapy, and her interest in biomechanics [3:20];\nHow Irene’s thinking about the use of orthotics has changed [7:15];\nThe evolution of the human foot and the transition from walking to running [10:30];\nThe evolution of shoes and its impact on running injuries [17:30];\nAn overview of running injuries [26:00];\nCushioned running shoes, heel striking and impact forces [29:30];\nShin splints [33:45];\nHow heel strike patterns promotes knee stress through rate of loading [35:30];\nThe critical importance of exercise [42:15];\nImpact forces and injury potential [45:45];\nHow shoe cushioning alters impact forces despite forefoot striking [49:00];\nAn overview of minimalist shoes [52:30];\nIrene’s protocol for transitioning people out of orthotics [58:45];\nTransitioning to minimalist shoes and a forefoot strike [1:05:30];\nFoot muscle volume, minimalist shoes, and orthotics [1:07:00];\nThe recognition of the importance of foot strength in podiatry [1:09:45];\nMinimalist shoes across the lifespan—from children to adults [1:12:30];\nWhy learning to forefoot strike on soft surfaces is not the best approach [1:20:00];\nKnee valgus and factors related to knee injury [1:21:45];\nIT band syndrome [1:28:30];\nPhysics and ground reaction forces [1:33:15];\nIrene’s approach to retraining a runner’s gait [1:36:00];\nCase study—How the transition to minimalist shoes decreased injury and improved performance [1:42:15];\nImportance of proper movement patterns and the negative influence of our modern environment [1:45:30];

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

And yet my thinking in terms of feet was completely opposite. … We don’t brace anything else permanently if you have an orthopedic problem.”\n\nDespite the common thinking that we should be prescribing a shoe type based on an individual’s need for support, a study done by Joe Knapik on thousands of military personnel found that there was no difference in injury rate\n \nThe evolution of the human foot and the transition from walking to running [10:30]\nAnatomical changes from walking man (Australopithecus) to running man (Homo erectus)\n\nA study by Dan Lieberman and Dennis Bramble (Bramble & Lieberman, 2004) describes human evolution in the context of endurance running\nJoint surfaces became larger to bear greater forces\nThe longitudinal and medial longitudinal arches developed\nThe achilles tendon became longer for greater energy storage\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13767\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-1-irenedavis-1024x811.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"811\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-1-irenedavis-1024x811.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-1-irenedavis-300x238.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-1-irenedavis-768x608.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-1-irenedavis.png 1202w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 1. The longitudinal arch and bony structure of the foot. Image credit: oist.jp\nComplexity of the foot\n\nThe foot has 26 bones, 33 articulations, and six degrees of freedom, resulting in a complex structure\nIt has four layers of arch muscle comprised of 10 muscles\nThis complexity allows for a stable base of support while being able to adapt to uneven terrain and absorb shock\n\nThe “born to run” concept\n\nPeter recalls Dan Lieberman stating during a lecture that no animal can cover as great of a distance over 24 hours as a human\nHumans have been running for 2 million years \nThe ability to run greater distances was an evolutionary advantage that allowed our ancestors to chase larger animals to exhaustion\n\n \nThe evolution of shoes and its impact on running injuries [17:30]\nEarliest shoes\n\nThe earliest known shoes date back to 10,000 years ago\nThey were made with sage brush bark and were basically a flat surface with a strap, similar to Huarache sandals\nThe primary purpose was to protect the bottom of the foot\n\nEarly running shoes\n\nPrior to the 1960s, running footwear was similar to what is sold as minimalist shoes today\nAs running became a popular activity for the general population, people were getting injured\n\nAchilles tendonitis was common — the general population were used to walking around in shoes with a slightly raised heel\nThen when the running boom happened, the existing running shoes were flat (i.e., no heel raise)\nAt that point, new running shoes were created with a heel lift and cushioning in an attempt to counteract the injuries\n\n\n\nTypes of modern running shoes\n\n“Motion control” shoes have a very stiff heel counter and stiffer material in the mid sole. They may also have additional plastic reinforcement, all to prevent the foot from rolling in\n“Cushioning” shoes are for people with a high arch and little foot movement\nRunning injuries did not appear in the research literature, or at least not nearly as much, until approximately when these specialized shoes appeared. \n\n \nAn overview of running injuries [26:00]\n\nRunning injuries are most commonly from the knee down, but can go all the way up to the neck\nThe reason why most injuries occur from the knee down is because this is where most shock absorption occurs\n\nLanding incurs a force that is 2.5 to 3 times body weight\nAt the knee, this force can be 7 times body weight\n\n\nAccording to Jeff Johnson, a former Nike employee, Nike brought in three sports podiatrists who concluded that the rise in running injuries was due to too much impact and motion, leading towards the added motion control and cushioning that is now seen in running shoes\n\n“Rather than have the runners adapt to the running, they took the shoe and adapted it to the runner.” \n—Irene Davis\n \nCushioned running shoes, heel striking and impact forces [29:30]\nImpact forces\n\nStudies have shown that people create greater landing force in the HOKA shoe\nThe increased cushioning gives a false sense of security that encourages a harder landing\n\nHeel vs. forefoot striking\n\nA study has shown that the heel has a relatively low pain threshold that doesn’t extend far beyond the level of force generated during walking—suggesting that we have evolved to be forefoot strikers\nOther studies have shown that it is footwear that encouraged many of us to become heel strikers\n\nLieberman et al., 2010\nLieberman et al., 2015\n\n\nMost barefoot runners are forefoot strikers (even Atlas the robot runs with a forefoot strike)\nIrene believes that we are adapted to be forefoot strikers and that this is why we have a long Achilles tendon\nAn advantage of heel striking is that it allows for a longer stride and therefore greater speed, and on softer surfaces, this might be reasonable\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13768\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-2-irene-davis-1024x583.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-2-irene-davis-1024x583.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-2-irene-davis-300x171.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-2-irene-davis-768x437.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-2-irene-davis.png 1472w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 2. Impact forces from heel striking versus forefoot striking. Image credit: researchgate.net\n \nShin splints [33:45]\n\nOne of the most common injuries that runners have when they first start running is an “overuse” injury called shin splints\nShin splints manifest as pain in the front of the lower leg\nThe primary muscle where this occurs, the tibialis anterior, is much smaller than the muscles in the back of the lower leg\nThe tibialis anterior concentrically lifts the forefoot towards the knee and eccentrically controls the lowering of the forefoot towards the ground\nBecause of the smaller size, the tibialis anterior is more prone to the fatigue and overuse that can result in shin splints\n\n“If you just look at the shape of the human lower leg, it’s designed to carry more load in the back than in the front.” \n—Peter Attia\n \nHow heel strike patterns promotes knee stress through rate of loading [35:30]\n\nA forefoot strike allows for the calf and the motion of the foot to absorb some of the impact force and also allows the transition of force from the foot to the knee to occur gradually\nWith a heel strike, more of the impact force goes directly to the knee, and the force is transferred more rapidly\nStudies have shown higher rates of force transfer to be associated with running injuries\n\nIrene’s approach with patients in the clinic:\n\nWhen people that come in with injuries will be habituated to foot orthotics and/or habituated to standard shoes\nIrene’s goal is to get the person running closer to the way we evolve to move and therefore lessening the risk for injury\n\n“We really try to get people back into shoes that allow their feet to do what they were adapted to do and to run in a pattern that is closer to our evolutionary legacy.” —Irene Davis\nDoes Irene believe that there are certain people who just shouldn’t be running?\n\n“I believe that running is an activity of daily living. People talk about running being a skill, I don’t think it is. We learn to run on our own.”\nVery few exceptions — e.g., huge leg length discrepancy that is really going to abnormally load, extreme foot deformities, etc.\nBut when you look at the normal distribution of people, most people can run\n\n \nThe critical importance of exercise [42:15]\nTrailer for an interesting documentary: The Motivation Factor \nThe documentary follows a high school boot camp-style fitness program:\n\nIn 1955, a Marine by the name of Stan LeProtti started a program at a high school in Carmichael, California in which every kid went through a military-type boot camp\nThe program was partly driven by motivation – each advancing level of fitness was associated with a different color of shorts — Everyone started out with white shorts and could then progress to different colors representing more advanced fitness levels\n\nHow the results of this program symbolize Irene’s thoughts on the innate human ability to run\n\nAll of the kids in this program ended fit and looking like they were in the military\nIrene believes that all of these kids, who now range from approximately 55-80 years old, would still be capable of running well today. \nShe believes that basic movement skill fosters proper running mechanics and that the lack of such skill is the reason why so many people today have improper running mechanics\nBut you do need to be fit to run because being fit implies development of the motor control needed to run properly\n\n“I think everyone who has a pretty normally intact neuromuscular system can run. But to answer your question, should that teenager who’s overweight and has been doing video games go out and run? Probably not.”\n \nImpact forces and injury potential [45:45]\nBased on Irene’s work with runners on a treadmill equipped with a force plate:\n\nHeel striking leads to a more rapid rate of vertical force development\nForefoot striking in minimalist shoes decreases the rate of force development\n\n \nHow shoe cushioning alters impact forces despite forefoot striking [49:00]\nForefoot striking in cushioned shoes has unwanted effects:\n\nIt promotes landing with more plantar flexion (forefoot more pointed towards ground), which exposes the Achilles tendon to greater stress\nIt also promotes landing on the outside of the foot, which causes an increase in lateral forces. This tends to result in problems in both the Achilles and peroneal tendons\n\nConsiderations for shoe selection\n\nForefoot striking should be done in minimalist shoes\nPeople who choose to remain heel strikers should wear cushioned shoes\n\n \nAn overview of minimalist shoes [52:30]\n“When I talk about minimal, I’m talking about a shoe you can roll up and put in your pocket.” \n—Irene Davis\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13769\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-3-irenedavis-1024x681.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-3-irenedavis-1024x681.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-3-irenedavis-300x200.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-3-irenedavis-768x511.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-3-irenedavis.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 3.

Otherwise, consequences include plantar fasciitis and metatarsal stress fracture \n\n \nFoot muscle volume, minimalist shoes, and orthotics [1:07:00]\n\nIrene’s team did a study (Chen et al., 2016) showing that cross sectional volume of foot muscles is larger in people who run with minimalist shoes\nAnother study has shown that people who start wearing orthotics experience a decrease in foot muscle volume\n\n \nThe recognition of the importance of foot strength in podiatry [1:09:45]\n\nRecently published physical therapy guidelines for plantar fasciitis include orthotics and other approaches, but neglect to include strengthening\nIn contrast, guidelines for any other part of the body do include strengthening\nDespite this, Irene’s experience is that podiatrists are becoming increasingly interested in using exercise and movement training instead of orthotics\n\n \nMinimalist shoes across the lifespan—from children to adults [1:12:30]\n\nIrene believes minimalist shoes are important for kids so that their feet develop properly\nSince we lose muscle power with age, and in the feet and lower extremities first, Irene also believes that transitioning to minimalist shoes is important for adults\nCourses/programs related to training forefoot strike: Pose Method & ChiRunning\n\n“It’s about getting people into shoes that let their feet do what they’re supposed to do.”\n \nWhy learning to forefoot strike on soft surfaces is not the best approach [1:20:00]\n\nRunning barefoot has the benefit of maximizing sensory input from ground contact\nRunning on grass barefoot is not a good idea because you may not see things that will injure your foot\nSoft surfaces in general will encourage more stiffness throughout the body\nIn contrast, harder surfaces will encourage a softer landing\n\nStudies that have shown softer running surfaces to encourage greater leg stiffness while running:\n\nRunning in the real world: adjusting leg stiffness for different surfaces \nRunners adjust leg stiffness for their first step on a new running surface \n\n \nKnee valgus and factors related to knee injury [1:21:45]\nInjuries are multifactorial\n\nPoor movement pattern is not always the cause. While someone with poor movement will likely be injured more quickly, someone with good movement still has increased injury risk if their dose of movement is too high\nPoor movement can manifest as injury in different ways – for example, knee valgus might cause knee pain, but it may instead cause hip pain\n\nCauses of injury and knee valgus\n\nIrene’s running injury clinic has worked with more than 700 people\nThe factors most often found in association with injury are high impact forces and poor alignment\nKnee valgus is the most common manifestation of poor alignment\nInstability of foot muscles, or the “foot core” as she calls it, is a cause of knee valgus\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13770\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-4-irene-davis-981x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"981\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-4-irene-davis-981x1024.png 981w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-4-irene-davis-287x300.png 287w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-4-irene-davis-768x802.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-4-irene-davis.png 1052w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px\" />\nFigure 4.

The reaction is therefore translated into pushing yourself away from the ground rather than pushing the ground away.\nAs these reaction forces are transferred through joints, the compress the joint in the process, which is how the force within the joint ends up being greater than the original amount of force being applied because of the internal moment arm in the joint and because of other stabilizing muscles contracting across the other side of the joint\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13771\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-5-irenedavis-1024x539.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"539\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-5-irenedavis-1024x539.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-5-irenedavis-300x158.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-5-irenedavis-768x404.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-5-irenedavis-1536x808.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fig-5-irenedavis.png 1768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 5.

It is not easy to retrain a movement pattern that has been engrained for decades\nFeedback is helpful, but must eventually be faded out\nIn Irene’s lab, the process involves an average of two months spent working on gait, four weeks of gait training on the treadmill, and then 10 weeks of supervised incremental increases in running\n\nThe disconnect between prevention and health insurance\n\nThe logical approach would be a proactive retraining of gait to prevent injury\nHowever, insurance only covers gait retraining after injury\nBecause of this, 100% of the gait retraining Irene does is with people who have already been injured\nThe example Peter gives to demonstrate the misguided approach taken by insurance companies here is that treating type 2 diabetes costs $7,000 to $12,000 per year compared to spending about $500 per year to prevent someone from ever getting the disease\n\nEvidence that gait retraining works over the long term\nOne of Irene’s former postdocs did a study involving 320 novice runners:\n\nHalf of the runners were trained on a treadmill to soften their impact (probably by inadvertently learning to forefoot strike)\nA year later, there was a 62% decrease in injuries\n\nSimilarly, a retrospective study by Dan Lieberman on the Harvard track team found that forefoot strikers had half of the chronic injuries as heel strikers\n \nCase study—How the transition to minimalist shoes decreased injury and improved performance [1:42:15]\n\nA physician in a closed Christian community, inspired by the book Born to Run, resolved his own foot problems by running barefoot and in minimalist shoes\nHe gradually started recommending it to members of the community’s track team who had season-ending injuries and weren’t responding to standard of care\nEventually, 80% of the community was wearing minimalist shoes, and referrals to podiatrists decreased as use of minimalist shoes increased\nThe community’s cross country team ended up completing a season with no injuries and winning their division. They were bumped up to the next division, where they also did well, possibly finishing as high as second\n\n \nImportance of proper movement patterns and the negative influence of our modern environment [1:45:30]\n\nPeter and Irene believe that frequent sitting and wearing of shoes present a major challenge for maintaining proper movement in today’s society\nIrene suggests that gym class in schools should be every day and should involve more demanding movement including calisthenics\nBy the time kids are 12 to 17 years old, a report from the National Adolescent and Young Adult Health Information Center shows about 31% of them have at least one chronic condition\nIrene also believes that sport specificity presents similar problems and that kids should be encouraged to play multiple sports\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialIrene’s running clinic: Spaulding National Running Center | (spauldingrehab.org) [0:50]\nThe book Born to Run by Christopher McDougall: Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen | (amazon.com) [8:15]\nStudy showing that matching running shoes to foot type in military personnel had no influence on injury rate: Injury-reduction effectiveness of prescribing running shoes on the basis of foot arch height: Summary of military investigations (Knapik et al., 2014) [9:50]\n2010 Nature paper on which Irene collaborated with Dan Lieberman: Foot strike patterns and collision forces in habitually barefoot versus shod runners (Lieberman et al., 2010) [10:15]\nThe arches of the foot that run in the direction of heel to toe: Longitudinal arches of the foot | (wikipedia.org) [10:35]\nThe tendon that attaches the calf muscles to the heel: Achilles tendon | (wikipedia.org) [10:35, 22:00, 33:40, 38:20, 49:00]\nStudy by Dennis Bramble and Dan Lieberman describing human evolution in the context of endurance running: Endurance running and the evolution of Homo (Bramble & Lieberman, 2004) [11:35]\nShoes that resemble the first shoes known to be used by man: Huarache sandals | (wikipedia.org) [17:55]\nThe largest muscle of the calf: Gastrocnemius | (wikipedia.org) [22:30]\nAn overuse injury that can be caused by running: Stress fracture of the tibia | (aaos.org, wikipedia.org) [26:50]\nA popular cushioned running shoe: HOKA | (hokaoneone.com) [30:10, 47:10]\nTwo studies showing higher impact forces with the HOKA shoe: [30:10]\n\nRunning in highly cushioned shoes increases leg stiffness and amplifies impact loading (Kulmala et al., 2018)\nEffect of shoe cushioning on landing impact forces and spatiotemporal parameters during running: results from a randomized trial including 800+ recreational runners (Malisoux et al., 2020)\n\nStudy showing that the pain threshold of the heel is nearly reached during barefoot walking: Force-deformation properties of the human heel pad during barefoot walking (Wearing et al., 2014) [31:20]\nTwo studies showing footwear to promote heel strike during running compared to barefoot runners: [31:55] \n\nFoot strike patterns and collision forces in habitually barefoot versus shod runners (Lieberman et al., 2010)\nVariation in foot strike patterns among habitually barefoot and shod runners in Kenya (Lieberman et al., 2015)\n\nA robot that runs with forefoot strike: Atlas | (wikipedia.org) [33:40]\nA common running injury in the front of the lower leg: Shin splints | (wikipedia.org) [33:40]\nThe muscle in the front of the lower leg associated with shin splints: Tibialis anterior | (wikipedia.org) [34:40]\nA meta-analysis and systematic review describing studies that have associated a greater rate of impact loading with running injuries: Do runners who suffer injuries have higher vertical ground reaction forces than those who remain injury-free?
