  "title": "#160 – Paul Offit, M.D.: The latest on COVID-19 vaccines and their safety, herd immunity, and viral variants",
  "content": "Paul Offit is a pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases and an expert in virology and vaccine development. He currently serves on the FDA committee evaluating COVID-19 vaccines. In this episode, Paul’s second appearance on The Drive, he provides an update on all the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently deployed, explains why the concerns raised around the mRNA vaccines are not legitimate, and offers his view on the prospects and timeframe of reaching herd immunity. He also takes a deep dive into immunology, explaining the short-term and long-term immune response to both natural infection and vaccination and how these two can function together to provide durable immunity. Additionally, they discuss the theories on the origins of this virus, what impact the new COVID-19 variants might have, and the recent pausing of the J&J vaccine. Finally, they discuss how we can be better prepared for an inevitable future outbreak of a novel virus. This episode was originally recorded on April 14, 2021.\n*WATCH PODCAST ON YOUTUBE*\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#160 - Paul Offit, M.D.: The latest on COVID-19 vaccines and their safety, herd immunity, and viral variants\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#160 - Paul Offit, M.D.: The latest on COVID-19 vaccines and their safety, herd immunity, and viral variants\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#160 - Paul Offit, M.D.: The latest on COVID-19 vaccines and their safety, herd immunity, and viral variants\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nOverview and current status of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies [4:10];\nAddressing concerns about mRNA vaccines [9:00];\nHow the failure to make an effective HIV vaccine aided the development of a COVID-19 vaccine [16:45];\nWhere SARS-CoV-2 falls on the spectrum of its ability to mutate and what that means for immunity and vaccination [21:30];\nHow the combination of short-term and long-term immune response to SARS-CoV-2 work together to provide durable immunity [28:00];\nImportance of understanding relative vs. absolute risk reduction [38:15];\nImplications of pausing the J&J vaccine due to reports of blood clotting in the brain [42:45];\nWhat constitutes herd immunity and the concerns of rising vaccine hesitancy [47:45];\nWhen we might reach herd immunity, future vaccines for children, and long-term outlook for maintaining population immunity [58:45];\nTheories about the origins of SARS-CoV-2 [1:07:00];\nPreparing for the possibility of a future pandemic and how we can learn from our mistakes [1:10:40];

Types of COVID-19 vaccines. Image credit: Wellcome\n\n1) mRNA is the farthest along in the US\n\nFDA granted EUA to Pfizer on Dec 10 and Moderna on Dec 17\n120 million have received at least one dose of one of these\n\n\n2) Adenovirus\n\nUses adenovirus as a vector to deliver viral DNA\nJenner Institute/Astra Zeneca (AZ): replication-defective adenovirus vector\n\nTens of millions of AZ in UK and Europe\n\n\nJanssen / Johnson & Johnson (J&J): replication-defective adenovirus type 26\n\n200K in west Africa for Ebola\nmore than 6 million in US for SARS-CoV-2 \n\n\n20 million + doses of these vaccines\nRussian vaccine is also a replication-defective adenovirus vaccine (human Ad26 followed by human Ad5)\n\n\n3) Purified protein\n\nMade by Novavax\ninsert gene for spike protein into baculovirus\ngrown in Spodoptera frugiperda cells (same way we make Flublok)\nNovavax has been slow to get approval\n\n\n4) Live attenuated\n\nstill in the works\nPaul doesn’t think one has been approved anywhere\n\n\n5) Whole killed viral vaccine\n\nUsed in China on 10+ million people\nSimilar to how we make vaccines for polio, rabies, Hep A, etc. \nsome question how well it works against SARS-CoV-2\nWhole killed virus was first used in late 1800s by Louis Pasteur against rabies\n\n\nThe first vaccines were live non-human viruses\n\nUsed cowpox in late 1700s\nThe virus was close enough to human smallpox that produced immune response\nbut they didn’t understand the science behind it back then\n\n\n\n \nAddressing concerns about mRNA vaccines [9:00]\n\nPeople say mRNA is experimental and like science fiction\n\nPeter has tried to point out it’s not as experimental as people think and has been around for decades\n\nSee Peter’s newsletter: mRNA vaccine technology\n\n\nNow is just the first time we did the final step of sequencing and putting it into clinical practice\n\n\nFour prior eras of vaccinology\n\nAnimal strains related to human ones\nInactivated\nlive attenuated\npurified protein\nin all of these, you are giving the viral protein you’re interested in (whole virus or live attenuated virus or just a purified protein itself)\nThen the vaccinated person makes antibodies to the protein\n\n\nmRNA vaccines are the 5th era of vaccinology\n\nyou are giving the gene that codes for the protein\nyour body makes the viral protein first and then the antibody response\nIt’s a genetic strategy, concerns people about altering your genes\nIt’s clear there is no short-term toxicity, but there is genuine concern that we don’t have data on long-term effects\n\n\n\nCan mRNA vaccines alter your DNA? (12:30)\n\nmRNA is carried in lipid nanoparticles, which are taken up by dendritic cells, the major antigen-presenting cells\nmRNA enters the ribosome and is translated into protein\nAfter a period of days the mRNA breaks down and no longer makes protein\nThese vaccines cannot alter our DNA:\n\nCan’t cross nuclear membrane into the cell nucleus (where our genome is located) without a nuclear access signal that it lacks\nIt’s RNA, not DNA, so it must be converted to DNA but lacks an enzyme like reverse transcriptase that could convert it\nWould then have to insert itself into DNA, which requires an integrase enzyme that it also lacks\n\n\n\n“You have a better chance of developing X-ray vision if you’ve gotten [an mRNA vaccine] than you have of the mRNA in any way altering your DNA.” —Paul Offit\nLong-term effects of mRNA vaccines (14:15)\n\nIn the past, serious adverse effects of vaccines have become apparent within 2 months\n\nOne of the squalene adjuvant influenza vaccines (Pandemrix) used against H1N1 during the 2009 swine flu pandemic could cause narcolepsy, very rare but real side effect (1 per 55K) within 6 weeks\nAlbert Sabin’s oral polio vaccine could cause polio – always within 6 weeks (1 in 2.4 million)\nInfluenza vaccine: can cause Guillain–Barré syndrome (an ascending paralysis which can be severe and occasionally fatal) within 6 weeks (1 per million)\nYellow fever vaccine can cause yellow fever (viscerotropic disease) within a week or so (1 per million)\n\n\nThese all became apparent within 2 months after 10 million + doses\nWe have not seen anything like this with the mRNA vaccines\nWe need to understand how mRNA is translated into a protein and that we don’t have the machinery to allow the reverse\n\n \nHow the failure to make an effective HIV vaccine aided the development of a COVID-19 vaccine [16:45]\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a counterexample to SARS-CoV-2\n\nWe could not develop a vaccine for HIV, which taught us some useful things\nHIV is one of the worst viruses\n\nyou make an antibody response that kills the virus\nbut it continues to evolve during a single infection, mutating again and again\nWe have to adjust the influenza vaccine each year because it changes, but HIV does that in a single infection\n\n\nReproduces primarily in T helper cells, major orchestrators of immune system\n\nhelp B cells make antibodies\nstimulate the cytotoxic T cells that kill viral-infected cells\n\n\nparalyzes immune system at the same time that it’s mutating, so immune system never catches up to it\nin the late ’90s, finally developed a highly active antiretroviral therapy as a treatment and made HIV a chronic disease\n\nbut still no vaccine\nMerck put several billion dollars into developing an adenovirus vector vaccine that was not successful\nIt didn’t work in any sense and in some ways it was actually worse for those who were vaccinated\n\n\nPeter thinks of HIV as an army that can specifically target another army’s general to prevent the chance of developing a coherent strategy to fight back\nWe have learned from past studies\n\nThe Merck HIV vaccine trial (using human Ad5) provided insight into replication-defective adenoviruses, as did Ebola vaccine trials\nThere was also an Ebola vaccine with a replication-competent viral vector using the vesicular stomatitis virus, which is like a harmless cousin of rabies\n\n\nJonas Salk‘s strategy was to try and take the whole virus and kill it\n\nbut that had very limited applicability\nPaul considers it as impractical idea like the universal flu vaccine\n\n\nPaul trained at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia in the early 1980s\n\nGot to work with brilliant scientists like Jon Yewdell and Walter Gerhard: “I don’t think I realize how lucky I was at that time to be around such amazing scientists”\nThe head of the lab told Paul, “If you want a research career that lasts for the rest of your life, study influenza”\n\n\n\n \nWhere SARS-CoV-2 falls on the spectrum of its ability to mutate and what that means for immunity and vaccination [21:30]\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is in the middle of a spectrum\n\non the one end of the spectrum is influenza, which has so much genetic drift that every year you have to get a new vaccine\nAt the other end of the spectrum are polio, smallpox, pertussis, etc., whose mutations don’t seem to impact our immune system reaction\nSARS-CoV-2 is in the middle\n\ndoes not appear to have genetic drift like influenza where seems like a new virus every year\nbut it also appears that a “one and done” vaccine strategy won’t work\n\n\n\n\nThe UK variant (B.1.1.7) might be covered by current vaccines, but the Brazilian and South African variants might not be given significant changes in their binding properties\nPaul is on the FDA’s Vaccine Advisory Committee\n\nmeets in the first week in March to look at data and predict which flu strains the vaccine needs to cover that year\n“it’s amazing we usually get them right given how much this virus mutates”\n\n\nMutation frequency\n\nFlu is a single-stranded RNA virus that constantly mutates\nMeasles is a single-stranded RNA virus that mutates in such a confined way that vaccines developed in the 1960s are still effective\nSARS-CoV-2 is in the middle\n\n\nViruses mutate to become more contagious but not necessarily more deadly, which would slow their ability to reproduce themselves\nThe virus that left China was the first variant, D614G, that swept through Europe and the US and is covered by current vaccines\n\nThe critical question: To what extent will it drift away from immunity caused by vaccination?\n\nBut several new variants have now appeared\nB.1.1.7 seems close enough to D614G to be covered by the vaccine\nBut… the other variants (South African, Brazilian, New York, etc.) are different, but so far aren’t “critically” different — meaning natural infection or vaccination still protects against hospitalization, ICU admission, and death\nWe haven’t yet “crossed the line” to the point where vaccinated people are hospitalized or killed by a variant virus\nPeter wonders: \n\nWhen a vaccinated person is hospitalized with a variant, how will we know that it’s because their existing immunity was incapable of responding versus they simply had lost immunity?\nAre we also checking for some quantitative or qualitative assessment of their existing immunity?\nPaul says if you had a strain that should have been susceptible to the vaccine, we really can’t tell if you had an adequate immune response and lost it OR… if you never really developed an adequate response at all. \n\n\n\n \nHow the combination of short-term and long-term immune response to SARS-CoV-2 work together to provide durable immunity [28:00]\n\nShort-term antibody-mediated response (humoral immunity)\n\nIsolate the variants\ntest the B cell response by seeing if they are neutralized in the lab by sera from people who are adequately immunized or people who are naturally infected\n\n\nLonger-term memory response (cell-mediated immunity)\n\nTesting B cells doesn’t take into account the T-helper cell responses\nT cells tend to offer broader immunity\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15269\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fig-3-offit2-1024x722.png\"

Cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immune responses. Image credit: Boston University\n\nTesting humoral immunity is still useful\n\nIf the variants pass the B cell test, we don’t need to take action\nwe don’t know about T cell response, but we can’t depend on it\nso if it’s failing the B-cell test, we’re going to take action\n\n\nShane Crotty and others at La Jolla Institute found that people who were naturally infected and then re-infected were still protected\n\nantibody responses can fade 5-7 months later\nbut memory B-cells, T-helper cells, and cytotoxic T-cells were still there\n\n\nIncubation periods\n\nSARS-CoV-2 incubation period (from the time of first exposure to development of symptoms) is about six days\ninfections like rotavirus or influenza have very short incubation periods (1-2 days)\nOthers like measles, rubella (German measles), or chickenpox have incubation periods of 10 to 14 days\nEasier to eliminate a virus if a long incubation period\n\nMeasles was eliminated by 2000 and rubella by 2005\nMeasles only came back because if vaccine refusal\nWith long incubation periods, there is plenty of time for activation and differentiation of memory B-cells to become effector cells (antibody-producing cells)\n\n\nWith shorter incubation periods, best you can do is modify disease\n\n\nCan still stimulate long-lived memory cells to become antibody producing cells\n\nbut because the incubation period is so short, replication has already started\nTakes 3-5 days to get activation and differentiation of memory cells\nThis is true of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rotavirus\n\n\nBut with a disease like measles (long-incubation period), as long as you have memory cells, you have plenty of time for activation and differentiation of those cells to become antibody-reading cells\n\nSo in that case can eliminate rather just modify disease\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is in between\n\nhas a 6-day incubation period\nvirus in the bloodstream is really not an important part of pathogenesis, so IgG memory is a bit less important\nPaul thinks that we can control this infection\nOur choices are immunization or natural infection\n\n\n\nHow the cellular immune system comes into play (32:30)\n\nAt first contact, neutralizing antibodies can provide immunity in the weeks and months following an infection\n\nBut 6-18 months later, neutralizing antibodies may not be there in sufficiently high enough titers\n\n\nUpon reinfection, virus is broken down into small (10- to 15-mer peptide) fragments on the surface of major antigen-presenting cells: dendritic cells, macrophages, and to some extent B-cells\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15270\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fig-4-offit2-1024x539.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"539\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fig-4-offit2-1024x539.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fig-4-offit2-300x158.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fig-4-offit2-768x404.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fig-4-offit2.png 1468w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 4.

Helper T cells stimulate both antibody-producing B cells and cytotoxic T cells.  Image credit: Gertrud U. Rey, Virology Blog\n\nAs long as you have immunological memory, you will get activation and differentiation of\n\nmemory B cells to become effector (antibody producing) cells\ncytotoxic T-cells to become cells that kill virus infected cells\n\n\nCrotty’s work suggests that memory cells for natural SARS-CoV-2 infection is fairly long-lived\nData on mRNA viruses suggest that there is stimulation of T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells after the second dose (implying a longer-lived response)\nPaul hopes both infection and vaccines will be protective for 3-4 years\n\n“But the good news about the mRNA strategy is this is a powerful immunogen. . .I’m amazed at how effective it is.” —Paul Offit\n\nWith both this vaccine and smallpox, can get ipsilateral lymphadenopathy (enlargement of the lymph node enlargement under the arm the shot was given in)\n\nAntigen-presenting cells travel to the local lymph node and then stimulate enough response that the lymph node actually enlarges\nNot common with most vaccines\nPeter and his wife had whole-body MRI scans after mRNA vaccines\n\nthe radiologist found that extensive lymphadenopathy\nwas enough that, out of context, it would have raised a concern of breast cancer in his wife\nBut he is seeing this response frequently in people who have had RNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it that the J&J virus is able to provide such a benefit after only one injection whereas the RNA viruses needed that second injection?\n\nRequired number of doses\n\nreplication-defective adenovirus vaccines like J&J (human Ad26) induce cellular immunity after a single dose\none dose of mRNA vaccine gives you 80% effective protection whereas the second dose gives you 90% or 95%\nPaul worries that people will skip the second dose – “the choice not to get that second dose is a choice probably to get less storable immunity, less complete immunity and likely less effective immunity against these variants”\n\n\n\n \nImportance of understanding relative vs. absolute risk reduction [38:15]\n\nPeter thinks the vaccine companies have not communicated clearly the difference between relative risk reduction and absolute risk reduction\n\nMedia said that Pfizer is 96% effective, Moderna 95% effective, but J&J is only 66% effective\nWould lead you to ask why you would take J&J (or why not take 2 doses)\n\n\nPeter wrote a post about the difference between absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction that explains this in detail\nHave to consider absolute risk reduction here\n\nJ&J vaccine has a 1.7% absolute risk reduction\nModerna has 1.2% absolute risk reduction\nPfizer may be less than 1%\nAll great vaccines, but J&J gets “the most bang for its buck”\n\n\nWhy is there a discordance between the lowest relative risk reduction (in the mid-60s) and the highest absolute risk reduction (1.7%)? \n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines may have been tested on less susceptible populations\nwhile J&J was tested on a sicker population that was therefore going to benefit more greatly\n\n\nIn the Pfizer trial, there were 162 cases per 20,000 in the placebo group and 8 cases per 20,000 patients in the vaccine group\n\nThe absolute difference is much less dramatic than the relative risk\nthe absolute risk difference was ~0.9% and the difference was something along the lines of 8 versus 165 \n\n\nmakes Peter suspect that the Pfizer subjects were either less exposed or healthier\n\nThere was something in these populations that differed dramatically from the J&J population where there were 500 versus 100 infections\nSo the relative reduction wasn’t as high, but the absolute reduction was1.7%, which means the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent a negative outcome is very low, maybe around 60\n\n\nPaul suggests an analogy to think about it:\n\nyou have a certain risk of being hit by a car when standing on your front lawn\nthat risk increases if you cross the street\nBut you cross the street all the time without getting hit\nThe absolute risk of getting hit as you cross the street is very small, even though the relative risk is much higher than if you were standing on the lawn \n\n\n\n \nImplications of pausing the J&J vaccine due to reports of blood clotting in the brain [42:45]\n\nAt the time of this podcast, the J&J vaccine had been given to ~6.9 million people in the United States\n\nThere were 6 serious clotting episodes and one person died\ninterestingly, all in women, which is probably not a coincidence although but it’s too soon to tell\nsaw the same with AstraZeneca, but is not clear whether that’s a coincidence or not\n\n\nData for the J&J vaccine referenced in the JAMA paper\n\nDidn’t give NNT but Peter estimated based on the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR)\nNNT = 100 / 1.7 = ~60\nThat applies to all adverse reactions, including hospitalizations and death\n\n\nFor this discussion, assume there’s about one case of cerebrovascular sinus thrombosis (blood clot in a cerebral vein) per million people who get the vaccine\n\n~ 1,850 people would be prevented from dying per million people who get the vaccine\nSo there’s a trade-off of about 2000:1 to prevent death\n\n\nPeter thinks the we overreacted by pausing the J&J vaccine\n\nAt least we have other vaccines, but that reaction might stop people from getting vaccinated\nPaul says, “The minute you pause that vaccine, you sent a chill through people in this country. I think that it would affect not only this vaccine, but I think even it would spill over to any COVID vaccine, which is, I think, what worries me the most about this pause.”\n\n\nIt’s appropriate to make sure physicians know about it\n\nnormally you’d treat thrombosis with heparin and that’s the worst thing to do in these cases (intravenous immunoglobulin may be the best treatment)\nalert physicians so if within 2 weeks of getting the J&J vaccine a patient had a severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg pain, etc. they know to pay attention to that\n\n\nMany cities and states are no longer distributing the vaccine\n\nmight not matter in one sense because we have other vaccines available\nbut on the other hand, it might make people scared\n\n\n\n“If you ask me the question, ‘What do I fear most about this whole pandemic?’ it’s actually not the variants. … It’s that there would be a significant percentage of the population that is going to choose not to vaccinate so much so that we can’t get to that 80+% of population immunity we need to slow this virus.” —Paul Offit\n\nA nurse at Paul’s doctor’s office told him she was not going to get vaccinated\nSome specific groups say that they will not get a vaccine:\n\n29% of Republicans\n28% of white Evangelicals\n10% of Black Americans\n\n\n\n \nWhat constitutes herd immunity and the concerns of rising vaccine hesitancy [47:45]\n\nPaul defines herd immunity the same for both mucosal viruses like rotavirus and for non-mucosal, systemic viruses where the virus spreads into the bloodstream (like polio, measles, and rubella), even though rotavirus cannot be eliminated and the others can\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15272\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fig-6-offit2-835x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"835\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fig-6-offit2-835x1024.png 835w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fig-6-offit2-245x300.png 245w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fig-6-offit2-768x942.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fig-6-offit2.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px\" />\nFigure 6. Representation of herd immunity. Image credit: Wikipedia\n\nFor SARS-CoV-2, as with rotavirus, it will not be eliminated, but we can aim to significantly slow the spread\n\nWhen rotavirus vaccine was introduced, every year there were several million cases, ~75,000 hospitalizations, and roughly 60 deaths\n\nno child got to age five without being infected\n\n\nRotavirus came into the US in 2006\n\nwithin a few years, dramatic drop in the spread\nIt’s still out there, but it’s much, much less\nmany medical residents today have never seen a case of rotavirus-induced diarrhea and dehydration, which was common during Paul’s residency\n\n\n\n\n“So, you can control it, but you’re not going to eliminate it”\n\n\nThere is a formula that considers the contagious index and the efficacy of the vaccine\n\nYou probably would need at least 80% of the population to be immune either from natural infection or immunization to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2\nIt would slowly get under control if we can get all 194 countries to get a significant percentage of their population vaccinated\n\n\nWe will have to give SARS-CoV-2 vaccines continually until other countries have gotten it under control\n\nThe US hasn’t had a case of natural polio since the 1970s\nBut we still vaccinate kids against polio because it still exists in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan\nAs long as it exists, it could always come back\nThat’s going to be true for SARS-CoV-2 too\n\n\nBut we can control this virus if we can get at least 80% of the population immune\n\nPeter accepts medical freedom and supports a person’s right to choose to not get a vaccine\nHe thinks we can get to herd immunity when enough healthy people who have refused vaccination survive the infection\nMaybe 30% of American adults are going to refuse vaccination\n\n\nThe COVID tracker reports 32 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2\n\nbut that’s only people who have been tested and found to be infected\nThe CDC estimates 85 million, and Paul guesses it’s probably closer to 100 million people who are now naturally immune\nBut we don’t know the overlap between those people and those who have been vaccinated – it’s a Venn diagram\n\nPeople who have been infected and know it\npeople who have been infected but are unaware, and \nA subset of the people who will refuse vaccines and then get infected\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine hesitancy: how much does it matter?\nWith all of these groups having natural immunity, and many others being vaccinated, are vaccine refusers a concern?\n\nPaul says this question is assuming that natural infection induces a durability and completeness of protection that is the same as the vaccine\nThere have been cases where the vaccine was more effective than natural immunity (for example, human papillomavirus (HPV), tetanus, and the conjugated Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) pneumococcal vaccines)\nIt might be reasonable to give those with natural immunity one shot of mRNA vaccine, like a booster strategy\n\nPaul does not agree that people should be able to refuse vaccination in this case\n\nIf you refuse a tetanus shot, it only affects you\nBut if you refuse the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, “you are making a choice potentially to catch and transmit a potentially fatal infection. And see, I don’t think that’s your choice”\n“If you’re going to stay in your house and the only time you ever walk outside you’re going to be really good about wearing a mask and making sure you’re 4 or 6 feet away from somebody else, great, but that’s not the way it’s going to play out”\nPaul’s hospital is discussing mandating the vaccine for people who work there\nHe believes that people who work in a hospital with vulnerable hospitalized children have a responsibility to get vaccinated\n\nPeter agrees that vaccines should be required in some cases\n\nworking in healthcare is a privilege, not a right: “If you’re going to work in a hospital and take care of patients, I do not believe you should have the right to refuse vaccination”\nPeter supports mandated MMR vaccines, for example, to protect children from the negative impact of a parent’s bad decision\nPeter also thinks that society will have to make decisions about other privileges like who can fly on an airplane or enter a country\n“I’m sure every statement I’m making is making a newer and newer faction of people irate”\nPeter does support allowing private citizens who don’t work in jobs that put others at risk to refuse vaccines if they don’t lie about it and bear the consequences of their decision\n\nReasons everyone should get vaccinated\n\nPeter knows that his chances of dying if he contracted COVID are lower than being in a car accident, but he would still choose the vaccine because there appear to be non-trivial, long-term consequences from infection\n\nAn article in JAMA discussed some of the long-term neuropsychiatric complications that are being seen in up to 25% of people 6-12 months after infection \nit’s a no-brainer to vaccinate when you weigh the risk of these types of complications against the risk of the vaccine\n\n\nPaul sees the hospital as a “microcosm of society”\n\nmay be 500,000 people who can’t be vaccinated because they take biologicals for their chronic disease or are getting chemotherapy for cancer\nThey are dependent on others to get protection from the virus\n\n\nWhen there was a measles epidemic in California, a Democratic State Senator (and pediatrician) named Richard Pan successfully lobbied for the elimination of the philosophical exemption to CA’s vaccine law\n\nthe state did not have a religious exemption, so that left only medical\nA 7-year-old boy had been treated with chemotherapy for leukemia\n\nHe came to hearings on eliminating the exemption and told officials that he depended on them for protection\n\n\n“And I think that that’s how I see the hospital in some ways as society. And you don’t know who you’re running into when you’re getting on a subway or a bus or whatever. … If it’s a contagious disease that’s where I … draw the line.” \n\n\n\n \nWhen we might reach herd immunity, future vaccines for children, and long-term outlook for maintaining population immunity [58:45]\nVaccine mandate?\n\nWhether or not it is the right thing to do, it’s very unlikely the authorities will mandate everyone get vaccinated\nMore likely to use incentives \n\nSuch as universities may require a vaccine to return to in-person classes\nAlso, travel restrictions may ease up only for those who are vaccinated\n\n\nBut Peter says we’ll never be able to have the societal equivalent of saying “you can’t attend school unless you are vaccinated”\n\nHow long is it likely to be before we achieve herd immunity in the US? (59:45)\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s estimate 25-30% of the population is naturally infected\n22-23% of adults have been fully vaccinated now\n\nThere is overlap between these two groups\n\n\nIf assume close to 40% have immunity, need to fully immunize another 120 million people to get to 80%\n\nWe are currently administering more than 3 million doses of vaccine a day, but mostly two-dose vaccines\nIf we continue to administer 3 million doses a day, we could vaccinate that other 120 million people within 3-4 months\nAround midsummer there will be enough vaccine for everyone, and that is when we will find out what percentage will refuse to be vaccinated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll know whether or not we’ve succeeded with herd immunity when we see what happens next winter\n\n\n\n\nThis is largely a winter respiratory virus, so next winter we will find out whether or not we’ve succeeded with herd immunity\nLast year numbers shot up in early March (2000-2500 deaths a day) but came down April – June\nIn the summer there were hundreds of deaths a day\nBy November-December, took off again with 2000 deaths a day and rose to in the 4000s\nthen started to come down again\n\nmaybe because more people had either natural immunity or had been vaccinated\nalso probably related to weather\n\n\nif we’re not at effective population immunity, we’ll see another surge this coming winter\n\n\nWe’ll likely need to continue vaccinating for SARS-CoV-2, including children\n\nnow have a vaccine for 12 and up\nby early 2022 should be 6 and up\n\n\nKids are at risk from multisystem inflammatory disease in children (MIS-C)\n\nnot uncommon and Paul has seen it up close\nmany of the kids had no symptoms when they were infected\nabout a month later, they come in with\n\nhigh fever\ninvolvement of heart, liver, lung, and kidneys\nheart enzymes spilling out into the bloodstream\n\n\nThe kids test negative with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test but they are antibody positive\n\ntheir immune system has been induced to make an inflammatory response against themselves, primarily against the cells that line blood vessels\nIt’s largely a vasculitis, which can affect every organ’s blood supply\n\n\nPaul thinks some of these kids are going to have long-term problems\nLike Kawasaki disease, it could be another multisystem inflammatory disease that causes long-term heart issues\n\n\nWe will have a lot more data in about a year and will see one of two scenarios:\n\nenough people refuse vaccination that we never truly achieve herd immunity\n\nthe real tragedy is for the vulnerable people who can’t be immunized because of their cancer treatment or rheumatologic treatments\n\n\nwe get to herd immunity because enough people are naturally infected and/or vaccinated\n\ngoing down to age 6 for vaccines should be enough for herd immunity; maybe not even that young given that ~ 20% of the population is less than 18 years old\n\n\n\n\nIn Michigan there has been a surge of cases but not deaths\n\nLikely because 55-57% of people over 65 now have been vaccinated fully and ~75% have gotten at least one dose of vaccine\nPeople over 55 account for 92% of COVID-19 deaths, so deaths are starting to drop as that age group is vaccinated\n\n\n\nBooster shots\n\nIn about 2 years we should have a better understanding of the need for booster shots\nPrior to COVID-19, there have been challenge studies with other coronaviruses\n\nSubjects were infected with one of the coronavirus serotypes and then a year later re-infected to measure the protective effect\nOne study found that a year later, antibody titres were still slightly raised but not always protective\n\n\nPaul thinks we might be protected for a few years, but not probably not decades\n\n \nTheories about the origins of SARS-CoV-2 [1:07:00] \nWhere did SARS-CoV-2 come from?\n\nTwo theories about origin of SARS-CoV-2:\n\nvirus came from a bat or a bat via some intermediary mammal and made its way to humans\nescape of a virus in a lab that happened to be near Wuhan\n\nthree labs near Wuhan did this type of research\nnot believed to be deliberate, but perhaps an accidental breach in protocol\n\n\n\n\nLaboratories have done gain-of-function studies to see what would happen if they alter a virus so it can do things it cannot do naturally\n\nfor example, rabies is a universally fatal virus that is not easily transmitted, so if it were made contagious in a lab it could be more easily studied\nIn the movie Contagion, a fatal Nipah virus was made highly contagious and killed Gwyneth Paltrow and other characters\n\n\nPaul is actually not sure humans are smart enough to have engineered this virus given how many things it can do\n\nTo confirm the story we’d need to compare sequences of those early strains as well as sera from people in China from before this virus was said to have spread\nWe’re dependent on a whistleblower from Wuhan\n\n\nWe determined the origin of HIV using sequencing\n\nWhen compared all the sequences, we found that HIV evolved from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in Cameroon in the 1930s\nNot clear how it was transmitted to humans – maybe a hunter injured a chimp and ended up infecting himself\n\n\nPaul’s theory it that it jumped from a bat to humans\n\npresumably from an intermediate host that remains unidentified (maybe pangolins)\nChina has not let us have access to the information we’d need to figure it out\n\n\n\n \nPreparing for the possibility of a future pandemic and how we can learn from our mistakes [1:10:40]\nIf not when\nIf it occurred naturally, it’s a question of if (not when) this will happen again\n\nWithin about 20 years we’ve had SARS-1 (~2002), MERS (~2012), and now SARS-CoV-2\nPaul says we should assume this will happen again\nWe need a level of international collaboration … an international surveillance system where all countries are open to this, where we can identify it, do the kinds of works we need to do not just to make a vaccine, but to have personal protective equipment and ventilators or anything else that you’re going to need, so that we’re not overwhelmed by this\n\nPossible future scenarios\n\nNo one alive has lived through something like this as an adult (and only a very few as infants in 1918-19)\nIf the new virus is either more virulent with the same degree of transmissibility as SARS-CoV-2, or it’s similar in virulence with an even greater transmissibility, the next pandemic could be worse\n\nPeter says we got lucky with SARS-1 and MERS because if their biology – for example, MERS was so deadly that it didn’t spread well\nPaul agrees: both SARS-1 and MERS did not have the level of asymptomatic transmission that SARS-CoV-2 has\nThose diseases also caused moderate to severe disease, so it was easy to identify who was infected\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is more likely to be like polio\n\nAs a child of the 1950s, Paul remembers the horrors of polio\nonly about one of every 200 people who was infected with polio virus was paralyzed\na lot of asymptomatic transmission occurred\n\n\nPeter uses the analogy of driving a race car\n\nthe worst thing you can do is brake too late. Then you have to brake much harder than you want to and you’re probably going to crash\nPeter says,“I sort of feel like that’s what happened in the United States, which is we didn’t brake soon enough and when we did brake, we had to brake way harder than we should have and we crashed”\n\n\n\n“At the heart of that question is how much do I have faith in human nature that we can learn from these things, that we will have … international collaborations and more open borders regarding sort of scientific inquiry. We haven’t been very good at that so far. If we don’t learn our lesson here, I mean, we’re never going to learn it. So, I don’t know. I don’t have an enormous amount of faith in human nature that we’re going to learn from this.” —Paul Offit\nPaul’s ideas for preparing for the next pandemic (01:15:15)\n\nNeed international collaboration for surveillance and sequencing\nThen need to make sure everyone has what they need, because “we’re only as strong as the weakest nation”\n\neven with the vaccines there has been a certain level of nationalism\nPaul respects and admires Dr. Fauci, whom he calls a “phenomenal science communicator” and a “brilliant man,” but he was disappointed when Fauci said the US did not need to approve any more vaccines because it had enough\n\n\n\n“I think our country has a responsibility to all countries in this world who are economically and technologically advanced to provide vaccine for everyone if we can – and we can.” —Paul Offit\n\nThe mRNA vaccine doses are measured in micrograms (µg or mcg) – that’s a millionth of a gram (10-6)\n\nThe vaccine can be produced in kg (103), so there’s a nine-log difference\nPaul says we can and should make billions of doses of an mRNA vaccine for the world, even if it means restricting intellectual property rights, because it’s the right thing to do\n\n\n\nTaking a global perspective: international vaccine hesitancy and what the US needs to do better during the next global pandemic (1:17:15)\nGlobal vaccine hesitancy\n\nThe Vaccine Confidence Project \n\nRun by Heidi Larson at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine\nShe is the author of Stuck: How Vaccine Rumors Start — and Why They Don’t Go Away\nData shows that France is the least vaccine confident country in the world\n\n\nThere are two groups of vaccine refusers:\n\nSkeptics\n\nWant to see the data to make sure that what they’re putting into their bodies has been adequately tested and vetted\nPaul considers himself a skeptic\nBut at this point (120 million people in the US), he says it’s clear that the mRNA vaccines are highly effective and don’t appear to have a rare serious side effects\nLast September only about 30% of people said they would get vaccinated, then by December it was around 40%, and a recent survey found it was at 70%\n\n\nCynics\n\ndon’t trust the government, pharmaceutical companies, or the medical community\nPaul is amazed that some of them work in the medical profession\nNeil deGrasse Tyson has a great quote about this: “You can’t use reason to convince anyone out of an argument that they didn’t use reason to get into”\n\n\nraises hard questions about using carrots and sticks if they are putting others at risk\n\n\n\nWhere did things go wrong in our response to the most recent pandemic? (1:19:00)\n\nPeter says that the greatest single failure in the past year, mostly on the part of the government, was how long it took to get testing up and running\n\nToo many things weren’t in place: reagent for PCR tests, PCR machines, and other critical infrastructure were lacking\nIf we were prepared, as soon as we had the sequence, we would have been able to rapidly deploy tests\nOther things went well, like the speed with which the vaccine has been developed, and “the evolution of insight into critical care has actually been pretty darn impressive”\nBut testing speed fits Peter’s analogy of waiting way too long to hit the brakes and then slamming on the brakes and crashing the car\n\n\nPaul agrees: we had the sequence by January of 2020 and the virus started to kill Americans two months later\n\nWe “put all our eggs in the CDC basket” and needed many more groups making and quality controlling the tests\nThe CDC messed up the test – their negative control ended up being positive so those tests were useless\nby the time that all got sorted out, South Korea had done 500,000 tests when we had done fewer than 5,000 (although we are a much more diverse population and are less “cower-able”)\n\n\nwe did not have great federal leadership: we would have been much better off if we’d focused on getting testing in place, quarantining, and restricting national travel\n\n“We are roughly 4% of the world’s population and 20% of the world’s deaths when we have a technologically and economically advanced society.
