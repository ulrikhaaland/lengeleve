  "content": "Check out more of my recent content on COVID:\n\n(January 3, 2022) COVID Part 1: Current state of affairs, Omicron, and a search for the end game\n(January 23, 2022) Why I’m for COVID vaccines, but against vaccine mandates.\n(January 24, 2022) COVID Part 2: Masks, long COVID, boosters, mandates, treatments, and more\n(January 29, 2022) A follow-up to my article on vaccine mandates\n\n\nIn this episode, Peter sits down with Drs. Marty Makary and Zubin Damania (aka ZDoggMD), both previous guests on The Drive. Marty is a Johns Hopkins professor and public health researcher and ZDoggMD is a UCSF Stanford trained internist and the founder of Turntable Health. This episode, recorded on December 27, 2021, was in part inspired by some of the shoddy science and even worse messaging coming from top officials regarding COVID-19. In this discussion, Marty and ZDoggMD discuss what is known about the omicron variant, the risks and benefits of vaccines for all age groups, and the taboo subject of natural immunity and the protection it offers against infection and severe disease. Furthermore, they discuss at length the poor messaging coming from our public officials, the justification (and lack thereof) for certain mandates and policies in light of the current evidence, and the problems caused by the highly politicized and polarized nature of the subject. Themes throughout the conversation include the difference between science and advocacy, the messaging which is sowing mistrust in science despite major progress, and a search for what a possible “end” to this situation might look like. \nNOTE: Since this episode was recorded over the holiday and published ASAP, this is an audio-only episode with limited show notes.\n<iframe title=\"COVID-19: Current state of affairs, Omicron, and a search for the end game | Peter Attia, M.D.\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GklHGYY8vN8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#189 - COVID-19: Current state of affairs, Omicron, and a search for the end game\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#189 - COVID-19: Current state of affairs, Omicron, and a search for the end game\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#189 - COVID-19: Current state of affairs, Omicron, and a search for the end game\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nComparing omicron to delta and other mutations [4:15]; \nMeasuring immunity and protection from severe disease—circulating antibodies, B cells, and T cells [13:15];\nPolicy questions: what is the end game and how does the world go back to 2019?

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

these viruses include: influenza (the flu), coronavirus, adenovirus, and RSV\nPeople with comorbidities fill up the hospital\nHospitals operate at capacity\n\n\nThe question is at what point does this coronavirus become different from seasonal viral disease?\nThinking of this through the lens of evolution, Omicron would be the best (in terms of the virus’s best interest) because it is highly communicative and not lethal\n\nThe worst viruses are harder to spread and kill their hosts\n\n\nIs there an evolutionary argument or logic to suggest that as the virus becomes  more evolutionarily fit it will kill less and spread more? \n\nThis seems to make evolutionary sense\nCompare it to SARS-1\n\nIt had higher fatality rate\nIt could be detected symptomatically when it was contagious\nWhen people were asymptomatic, they weren’t contagious\nThis virus could be stopped by behavior restrictions\nWhat is now considered hygiene theater, pointing a temperature gun at somebody’s head would have worked (to identify who is infectious) with SARS-1\nEvolutionarily, this wasn’t avery successful virus\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 spreads with it’s asymptomatic and causes severe disease in vulnerable people (typically) \n\nBut there are so many vulnerable people that this ended up causing a pandemic level of drama\n\n\nNow Omicron spreads so fast that everyone gets exposed at some point\n\nIt causes less severe disease (we think)\nThis is a very successful virus that gets rewarded by being part of the pantheon of our seasonal biome that affects humans every year\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe Omicron is nature’s vaccine\n\nFor 93% of the population living in poor countries in the world, they don’t have access to a vaccine right now \nIt may be ideal to get the vaccine over getting the infection\nBut maybe that is the silver lining of this variant, providing immunity to those not vaccinated\n\nMaybe this is how the pandemic ends\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMeasuring immunity and protection from severe disease—circulating antibodies, B cells, and T cells [13:15]\n\nA Johns Hopkins study in pre-print shows the importance of T-cell immunity in protection from COVID\n\nThis is an under recognized part of the immune system and absent from  much COVID discussion\nT cell immunity is solid against Omicron as it is for Delta\n\n\nPeter brings up the expression, “what gets measured, gets managed”\n\nImmune strength is inferred by measuring circulating antibodies\n\nThis is not the same a neutralizing antibodies\nBoth are part of B cell immunity\n\n\nThen there is T cell immunity\n\nSee the podcast with Steve Rosenberg (on cancer) for an in-depth discussion of B cell versus T cell immunity\n\n\nThere is not a laboratory test for T cell immunity\nThere is not even a commonly available test to measure neutralizing antibodies\nOne can’t really measure what memory B cells are doing\n\n\nIt seems like we’re flying blind and making a lot of assertions about immunity based on what might be the least important thing that can be measured (levels of circulating antibodies) \nAntibody levels go up and down\n\nWhen people get a second dose of vaccine the antibody levels go up tenfold compared to the first dose\nThat second dose is good for activating memory B cells and memory T cells\nAntibodies come and go; they linger for moths in the system and then they wane\nHaving this intense focus on only 1 aspect of the immune system (antibody titers) creates a scenario where we’re chasing our tail to keep those levels high\n\nThe higher they are the less likely one is to test positive\nThis has created an expectation that the vaccine is somehow failing\n\n\n\n\nCellular immunity is still strong when antibody levels wane; it is still preventing severe illness\nFocusing on circulating antibodies creates a cascade of surrogate markers that don’t really measure what we’re directly interested in\n\nWhat do we really care about?\n\n# of people in the hospital, sick and dying\nLong-COVID\nHow do we look at this; do we have good measurement criteria to look at this?\n\nQuestion- are we immune to severe disease\n\n\nRealize people are still going to get cold and flu symptoms\n\nThey’re still going to potentially be infectious during that period\nBut they’re not going to settle into cytokine storm, ARDS, and being prone in a ICU ready to die\n\n\n\n \nPolicy questions: what is the end game and how does the world go back to 2019? [18:45]\n\nImagine if we tested for influenza every flu season and graphed on a daily basis the number of cases\n10-25% of the population will get infected with a respiratory virus every year because there are many viruses; we’re not going to eradicate these pathogens\nChase antibody titers or protection from severe disease\n\n \nA policy-minded framework for viewing COVID and the problem of groupthink [24:00]\n\nWhat the world looked like in 2020 is very different from today\nIn hindsight pulling kids out of school in March of 2020 was the wrong thing to do though it was a reasonable precaution\nThe view of this has changed over time as more knowledge and experience is available\nA framework to view COVID\n\n1) Preventing infections (social distancing, masks, vaccines, lifestyle modification)\n2) Treating infections (drugs)\n3) Providing supportive care for people who end up in the hospital (ventilion, steroids, etc.)\n\n\nKnowledge has come a long way in less than 2 years\nHow many people in the US are at risk of dying?\n\nA rough calculation comes to 1.4 million\nWhat will reduce this number without destroying society?\n\n\n\n[30:30]\n\nMany new therapeutics have not been incorporated into practice everywhere; this is a glimpse of what is broked in the broader healthcare system\nSuffering from problems of group think in medicine\nBenefits of specific interventions discussed\nScheduling of vaccine booster doses largely dependant on what was tested in the clinical trial\nEvidence for supplemental vitamin D being helpful is not strong\n\nThere is a difference between supplemental vitamin D and vitamin D acquired by being in the sun\n\n\nWhat should the message to patients be when 99.6% or whatever of people are going to get better, no matter what, in other words, staying home and doing nothing, they’re probably gonna be just fine\n\nIt is important to consider the patient’s risk factors and age, etc.\nIt is essential to risk stratify\n\n\nDoctor’s are put in a terrible situation in the US; they are put on the frontlines of the pandemic without any good data for a long time\n\nThe basic, bedside clinical research needed to answer questions quickly were not performed quickly\n\n\nThis created a vacuum that was filled with political opinion\nStats are discussed on how research money was spent\n\n \nThe difference between science and advocacy [39:00]\n\nThe difference between science and advocacy is very important but this line has been blurred\n\nThis is something Peter talked about with Rogan and a fundamental issue here\nScience is a process and information changes over time\nThe job of an advocate is different, it is to communicate something with complete certainty\nThere is uncertainty in science and this is not reassuring  \n\n\nConversations about science and ideas of policy are needed \n\nThe email from Francis Collins to Fauci was chilling\n\n\nOne of the big questions now is how to avoid group think\nHow science has been corrupted and there has been a shutdown of scientific discussion\nAcademic bullying is a problem\nWhy has the NIH not done a study on natural immunity?\n\n \nNatural immunity from COVID after infection [46:00]\n\nWhat we know\nContradiction between policy and scientific evidence\n\nConflict between public health and scientists\n\n\nNone on the podcast are virologists; are there other examples of viruses where natural immunity does not develop after infection is cleared?\n\nYes, Strep throat is an example\nThe flu (influenza) changes to make the pathogen different each year\nMeasles is an example where recovery provides sterilizing immunity and protection from reinfection\nPaul Offit discussed in a prior podcast the spectrum of immunity developed after recovery from infection\nSome coronaviruses cause the common cold (cold coronaviruses)\nOther coronaviruses cause severe disease, there have been 3 in history: SARS, MERS, and COVID 19 (aka SARS-CoV-2) (hot coronaviruses)\nStudy of SARS 17 years out show solid natural immunity\nMERS was studied 3 years out and the natural immunity was solid\nStart with the hypothesis that natural immunity works\n\nWe don’t see people get reinfected with severe illness\nRhesis monkeys were rechallenged with the virus; they were not reinfected\nCleveland clinic study of hospital workers exposed to COVID found no reinfection and vaccination did not add to protection\nWashington University study did bone marrow biopsies and looked at the activated T cells in the system\nStudy in Israel showed that natural immunity was 27 times more protective adjusted for age than vaccinated immunity\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies of natural immunity to COVID [51:15]\n\nStudy of natural immunity in Israel\nAnalyzed the rate of people who tested positive, did not get the vaccine, and then tested positive again\nData on boosters reducing hospitalization in people over 65 by 10-fold\nThe fear in public health circles that if they talk about natural immunity then people may try to get infected; this is risky\nLet’s be more honest in the conversation\nThe 2 studies cited by the CDC [53:00]\n\n“These studies would not qualify for a seventh grade science fair. The methodology was so poor.” -Marty Makary\n\n1 study in Kentucky, the rates of reinfection in both vaccinated and natural immune group were exceeding low\n\nThe sample size was too low\n\n\nThe second study made conclusions about population risk by surveying people in the hospital\nBut numbers from these studies get quoted all the time\n\n\nPeter asks about a meta-analysis\n\nMartin Cutler (who was the Harvard professor now he’s at Brownstone Institute) has summarized the 141 studies on natural immunity\n\n\nThe question is- does reinfection lead to severe disease and patients needing to be put on a ventilator?\nThere is not a lot of evidence published on this\n\nThis is knowable but it is frustration that this information is not published\n\n\n\n \nThe unfortunate erosion of trust in science despite impressive progress [57:15]\n\nDiscussion of breakthrough infections and infection during pregnancy\nThe internet amplifies these anecdotes into larger, distorted data sets influences fear and policy decisions\nThis is where science is needed to tease out this information\nAn advocacy position says vaccines cure everybody; this is arrogant\n\nScience acknowledges that vaccines are a probabilistic game\nVaccines reduce the probability of infection, the severity of infection, but that’s all probabilistic\n\n\nDemonstration of the scientific method in the last 2 years\nErosion of trust in science and medicine \n\nWhat will be the cost in the future because of this\n\n\n\n“We’ve won the battle and lost the war from a scientific perspective” – Peter Attia\n\nThe problem with vaccine mandates as an advocacy position\n\n \nDo the current mandates and policies make sense in light of existing data? [1:02:30]\nEffects of the pandemic on vulnerable members of society, children\n\nThe Brown University Study on childhood cognitive scores from 2020-2021 \n\nReduced verbal, motor, and cognitive performance compared to kids born before the pandemic\n\n\nMental health crisis\n\nDo the policies and mandates make sense? [1:03:30]\n\nHow much do vaccines reduce the ability to spread infection?\nLancet study, peak viral shedding showed peak viral shedding was equal in vaccinated and unvaccinated people\n\nThe difference was the time of virus shedding, 1 day versus 3 days, respectively\n\n\nQuestion- when a vaccinated person is asymptomatic (not pre-symptomatic) are they infectious?\n\nThese data are not available\nThe answer is, they are probably not infectious\nCommunity cocooning effects, seen in places like the Bay area where the vaccination rates are 90+ %; there really aren’t that many cases\n\n\nBenefits of vaccination [1:08:00]\n\nReduction in disease severity\nReduced disease transmission\n\n\nWould there be a different policy view if the vaccine didn’t reduce severity of illness by more than 50%, but it reduced transmission by 99%\n\nThe main goal here would be dropping transmission and achieving true herd immunity\n\n\nIf the goal is the opposite to reduce severe disease, policy changes dramatically\n\nThis shifts from a community level decision risk to an individual level decision\n\n\nMandates can backfire\n\n“ It seems to me that we’re using the wrong policy tool.” – Peter Attia\n\nTherapeutics we have today (just FDA approved) have cut COVID deaths to zero in the clinical trials\n\nOnce they get distributed, no one should be dying of COVID, with rare exceptions\nThese studies are still small, about 1000 in each arm\nIn a real population, some people treated will still die\n\n\nDo the policies of a 10-day quarantine for college students who test positive make sense when their disease will likely be mild?\nWhat is the evidence to support recommendation/ mandates of boosters?\nThis seems to be an opinion based on the best evidence available, an editorializing of sorts\n\nWhat are the costs of COVID policies [1:16:30] \n\nAnxiety in teens kept at home away from their social network\nPressure of using Zoom\nNow that we have better immunity against severe disease, do we need to change our society over COVID\n\nDoes every child need to be vaccinated\n\n\nPolicies are damaging our community and society\n\n \nRisks associated with vaccines, and the risk of being labeled an anti-vaxxer when questioning them [1:18:15]\n\nJ & J data, 6 cases of VTE (venous thromboembolism, blood clot) in 7 million doses\n\nAn incidence of about 1 in 1 million caused the vaccine to be pulled\nThere is a difference between peacetime and wartime vaccine communication\n\n\nDanger of letting vaccine rates for measles drop below 90%\nRisks of vaccination and benefits are worse for young people\n\n“There is a very small group of non-age diverse, non-ethnically diverse, poor political appointees with political allegiances, making all the decisions on COVID for the country” – Marty Makary\nThe label of anti-vaxxer has squashed legitimate questions [1:23:45] \n\nA tribalism had developed where a person who questions something that threatens the message of vaccinate everyone is labeled an anti-vaxer\n\nThese questions became squashed\n\n\nLast year Marty was calling for lockdowns and universal masking\nBut after vaccine rollout he recommended an age-based approach\nPeople with natural immunity can wait for the second dose of vaccine\nProblems with the VARS system of tracking vaccine complications; problems with follow-up\nThe vaccine still makes sense in certain contexts; its nuanced\n\n \nData on incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines [1:26:15]\n\nThe party line (and what CDC says) is the risk of myocarditis in young people from natural COVID infection is much greater than the risk of developing myocarditis as a result of vaccination\n\nThe denominator of how many people are infected with COVID is not known, this is underestimated\nThis stat relies on study of hospitalized patients, and of course they are sicker\n\n\nThe  European authorities have acknowledged the risk of myocarditis from the Moderna vaccine and don’t recommend it for people under 30\nThe risk of myocarditis is around 1 in 7,600 in males age 15-25; 90% of this complication was clustered around the second dose\n\nPublished in the NEJM \n\n\nMost of the myocarditis was mild but 1 person died (22 years old)\n\n“But look, by and large, this is a safe vaccine. But for parents asking these questions about vaccinating their kids against an illness that has an ultra rare rate of death in healthy children, this is a reasonable conversation to have maybe the rate of death from the vaccine parallels the rate of death from COVID in a healthy child” – Marty Makary\n\nThe CDC reports, there are 668 deaths in children over 2 years\n\nMany believe that these deaths are in children with comorbidity medical conditions\nBut they still need to be protected\n\n\nA German study in pre-print of children age 5-17 show that no previously healthy children have died from COVID\n\nThis changes the calculus for parents\nA conversation is needed; there is not a one-size-fits all strategy\n\n\nNew England Journal of Medicine study, published on December 8 looked at boosters in people under 30\n\nThere are no deaths in people under 30 who are vaccinated with the primary series\nYou can’t go lower than zero deaths\n\n\nA study published in Circulation in July of 2021 stratified risks and benefits by age\n\nFor 12-17 year olds, the Moderna vaccine is 3-4x more likely to be associated with myocarditis\nThe supplemental data came out 2 day ago and it’s 5x \n8-10 cases of myocarditis per million doses; this is 56-69 cases, 38 ICU admissions, and 1 death\nMore data is needed on this; what about the kids who make an unremarkable recovery? Are there any chronic issues?\nSome of these kids had preexisting cardiac abnormalities\n\n\n\n \nOutstanding questions about myocarditis as a side effect of mRNA vaccination and the benefit of boosters [1:35:00]\n\nThe WHO said the universal booster program threatens to prolong the pandemic and recommends against these boosters [1:39:45]\n\nBoosters will increase global inequalities because 93% of the population of poor countries has no vaccine\n\n\n\n \nThe risk-reward of boosters and recommendations being ignored by policy makers in the US [1:40:30]\n\nThe WHO says that people under the age of 6 should not be wearing a mask\nMany European countries have restricted or banned the moderna vaccine from anyone under the age of 30 because of the risk of myocarditis\nIs the US making policy errors?\nThe FDA bypassed their technical experts to recommend boosters for everbody\n\nThe experts said boosters are not needed for everyone over 18\nNow there’s enthusiasm to boost teenagers; a lot of the world is not on board with this\n\n\nData is lacking for Omicron when Pfizer put out a press release promoting boosters\n\nBut this began the group think on promoting boosters for everyone\n\n\nCOVID vaccines are not like the measles vaccine; they do not provide sterilizing immunity\n\nHigh level herd immunity is not achieved by vaccination\n\n\n\n \nSowing distrust: Lack of honesty and humility from top officials and policy makers [1:43:30]\n\nFauci is in the horrible position of being the nations top expert on infectious disease in a moment when nobody knew anything\nWhat is the long game?\n\n“Where’s the humility?  People are hungry for honesty right now.” – Marty Makary\n\nFrancis Collins thinks it’s unlikely that COVID came from the Wuhan lab\nDiscussion of gain-of-function research\nThis situation is similar to when doctors get sued over a medical error\n\nIt isn’t the graveness of the error, it’s the arrogance of the physician and their lack of humility when they interacted with the patient\n\n\nZDoggMD interviewed Fauci as part of a documentary filmed before COVID (not yet released) about vaccine advocacy and the anti-vaccine movement\n\nHe has been attacked by activists on conspiracy angles\nIt felt like science itself was under attack to some degree\n\n\nBut Fauci needed the insight to be honest\n\nIf masks should be saved for healthcare professionals, say so\n\n\nWe forget he’s 80, 81 now\nHe is rational, calm, logical, and science based so what is going on now is difficult\nWe shouldn’t be putting our entire faith and trust in 1 individual\nIt is good to hear multiple different medical opinions\nMarty was very nervous about the pandemic in the outset after talking to doctors in Wuhan\nHe made recommendations to the White House at the onset of the pandemic but they replied that it was okay because they talked to Dr. Fauci\n\nThey hedged their bets that it would fizzle out like SARS-1 in 2003\n\n\nAs a physician it’s easier to give reassurance than it is to say, “yes, I’m very concerned”\nThe problem is the focus on just one single opinion\n\n \nThoughts on testing: does it make sense to be pushing widespread testing for COVID? [1:52:15]\n\nZDoggMD asks, with the availability of the vaccine and therapeutics, does it make sense to have a widespread prush for testing?\nPeter doesn’t think so\n\nThere isn’t a precedent for tracking rates of infection for respiratory illnesses\nWhat we pay attention to is hospitalizations and severity of illness, death\nMorbidity and mortality are the statistics that matter, but somehow infection rate has become the metric that matters\nWe don’t measure influenza infection rates\n\n\nZDoggMD discusses personal downsides and upsides of testing\n\nFor someone who is young and asymptomatic, to be screened with an antigen test and identified as positive it’s stressful\nThe 5-10 day quarantine is difficult\nThe upside is, if this is a true positive, this person can stay home and not infect other people\nBut if the virus is already widespread, does it really make a dent in something like Omicron?\n\n\nPeter thinks the test shouldn’t be ordered unless the outcome would change how the patient is managed\n\nTest the symptomatic patient who therapeutics can help\nTesting asymptomatic athletes seems ridiculous\n\n\nPhysicians have been put on this singular mission to hunt viral replication and block it at all costs\n\nwhat’s lost is treating the entire person\nThe sustainability of this system has also been lost\n\n\nMass testing creates a burden\nThere is also a limited supply of tests, about 160 million tests per month\n\n \nWhat is the end point to all of this? [1:58:45]\n\nThis has been evolving from the beginning\nHow do we transition to an endemic virus?\nWe don’t want to overwhelm our hospitals\n\nShould we pay nurses and doctors an overtime bonus to get through this?\n\n\nHow many lives have been saved?\nHow many lives were cost by substance abuse, overdose, and economic disaster?\nMarty notes this is difficult because people are conflating two different problems that are happening simultaneous in the United States\n\n1) COVID-19 public health threat, mostly from the Delta strain\nVirus infecting 10-20 million Americans who are still at significant risk; those without natural or vaccine immunity\nWe’ve still got to get them vaccinated\n2) 250 million americans have some form of immunity; they are at risk of mild illness and now we’re waging world war II to transiently beat back a mild infection\n\n\nThe context of the risk of mild infection of those with some form of immunity is not being discussed\nThe people dying are those adults with no immunity\n\nSome are also older people who are unboosted \n\n\nThere are about 7,000 people being hospitalized with COVID a day, most of them with no immunity\n\nThese are adults who often have a risk factor like obesity\nThis is not talked about\nThis is a precise problem but we’re holding everyone else hostage\n\n\nMarty thinks people are fed up and pushing back\nAustralia  had the toughest lockdowns; their goal was zero COVID infections\n\nTheir prime minister just said, “we’ve got to get past the heavy hand of government. We’ve got to treat people like adults. We have to move from a culture of mandates to a culture of responsibility.”  \nThis is the way to move forward\n\n\nZDoggMD relates this to the form and function of COVID\n\nThe different forms are the masks and mandates and lockdowns and so on and so forth\nThe function is to obtain some outcome that we all agree is reasonable\nIt’s reasonable that we don’t want bodies piling up in the ER parking lot of the hospital\nOccasionally this happened in some areas, but on mass, it has not\nHow do we prevent this?  Target focused protection of the groups mentioned earlier\nBoosting a 16-year old or a college student is not a high yield way to do this\n\n\nHe looks at the hospital numbers in Ontario, Canada and their ICU utilization and wonders why they are going on lockdown\n\n \nDownstream consequences of lockdowns and draconian policy measures [2:05:30]\n\nWhat does the MMR vaccination rate (and other vaccines) look like for last year?   Has there been a shift?\nZDoggMD has read anecdotes about the level of kids going in for routine vaccinations dropping in the 80% range\n\nBecause parents are frightened and there is a backlash against vaccines in general\nWhat will the outcome of this be?\n\n\nPeter asks, “what is the long term consequence of this for a generation, all the people who have been marginalized, all the people who have been dismissed in their concern, all the people who have been told you are a horrible human being for questioning a vaccine” \nMarty doesn’t think our policy makers are getting good medical advice\n\nAs soon as Omicron cropped up in South Africa, our public health officials retreated to the one blunt tool that they know, a third dose of vaccine across the board\nThere is data to support a booster of older people but not young people\nHalf of NY city is closed down\n\n\nWhat about therapeutics? \nWhat about learning to live with it?\nZDoggMD notes that rational thinking is not how politicians tribalize our world; it’s a badge of tribal identity to say I believe in this or that regardless of what the long term outcome is\n\nThey want to rally their base\n\n\nTravel to South Africa was stopped because it’s easy, it’s politically expedient\nOmicron is everywhere; this was said from the beginning\nVaccination is a blunt instrument used to try and reduce cases\n\nSo it’s surprising that testing is encouraged because this is going to increase the number of cases\n\n\n\n“There’s this weird political tribalization that makes it irrational to people who are looking at it from an objective standpoint” – ZDoggMD\n \nThe polarized nature of COVID—tribalism, skeptics, and demonization of ideas [2:10:30]\n\nPeter asks how many people are in the middle of these 2 polar opposite views on COVID\n\nOn the one hand, people think this is a pharma conspiracy to make more money; the only thing that works is ivermectin\nThe other group is everyone needs to have a booster every Monday and we never want to see the world as it was in 2019 again until this virus goes the way of smallpox, a zero COVID policy world\nHow many people are not in one of these 2 groups?\n\n\nZDoggMD’s experience with his platform has created a synthesis middle position they call the alt middle; it’s not a politically central position\nPeter Linberg of The Stoa talks about this thesis position of COVIDians\n\nThis supports lock downs, COVID vaccines for everyone, mandates, closed schools\n\n\nThe anthesis position is the other position\n\nThis supports ivermectin as a therapeutic\nThis is all about control\nCOVID is not as serious as we think\n\n\nZDoggMD asks, “What is the synthesis of those positions? Where do you find truth? There’s everything is a little bit partial. So this ultimate perspective is you can call it the center, but it’s really a synthesis position in integral holistic position.” \nWhen he talks to people, walks them through it a little bit, he’s never talked to a thesis or antithesis person that hasn’t ultimately settled on a more synthesis position\n\nThis gives him hope\n\n\nBut what happens publicly is reward for polarizing into one of the 2 extremes; this needs to change\nZDoggMD notes that podcasts like Joe Rogan’s are so popular; he often espouses a synthesis rationalist position even when entertaining people on the show that are really more anthesis or more synthesis\nThe woke idea ideologues are common in rational people\n\nNot many rational people want to hurt a trans person or exclude someone based on their sexual orientation or their race\nThis ideology diminished real racism and inequality\nWe’ve had decades of progress\n\n\nWe talk about COVID-idiots, but are you going to call an African American in Baltimore who’s afraid of getting the vaccine because of Tuskegee and the long history of medical abuse a COVID-idiot?\n\nThis generates a ton of cognitive dissonance until you can see this from a integral perspective that all this stuff has a bit of thin partiality to it\n\n\nPeople are trying to synthesize something that is evolving\nZDoggMD feels like Twitter has weaponized the pandemic lunacy\n\nThis is why he’s staying away from Twitter now\nHumans react\nThis has been potentiated on mass now with technology, the drive to go in group out group\n\n\nPeople have been paralyzed by fear\n\nThey are being demonized but are actually good people\n\n\nMarty thinks these are good points and we need to do all we can to stand against tribalism\n\nWe can listen to others\nWe can admit when we’re wrong\nThese are characteristics that are being completely lost in the echo chambers of cable news and hearing what you wanna hear\nBig tech is allowing people to live in an alternate reality\nNews makes the other side look like they’re crazy because that’s how news has framed their position\n\n\n\n“We gotta fix this because the next pandemic is probably gonna be more severe” – Marty Makary\n \nLooking back at past pandemics for perspective and the potential for another pandemic in the future [2:20:00]\n\nOlder patients remember what it was like to go through the polio epidemic\nOther epidemics: H1N1, SARS, MERS, Ebola, Zika\nThe next serious pandemic may be antimicrobial resistance\n\nIt’s increasing each year\n\n\nMaybe it’s influenza virus (the flu)\nThe overall global fatality rate for COVID-19 is somewhere around two tenths of 1%\nWhat if the next strain of influenza has a fatality rate of 2%?\n\nWe can’t do this with the current polarized echo chamber of the news and politicization of the immune system\n\n\n\n“We can’t do this in the future. We’re going to need diverse opinions, an open form of discussion, honesty, humility.” – Marty Makary\n\nMarty is very concerned about where we are in our current situation\n\n \nWhat parents can do if their kids are subject to unreasonable policies [2:25:00]\n\nShould a 12 year old not be able to play sports if they’re not vaccinated?\nA lot of people are fed up\nDemocracy does work, but it takes time\nPolls show that people want a reasonable approach\nMarty predicts that pharma will change the language to discuss an annual booster, “are you up to date with your booster” \nThings people should talk about and ask about\n\nAn endpoint to restrictions in schools\nCriteria to remove masks\nA single dose of the Pfizer vaccine for their children or spacing out the doses\nSome people with natural immunity should feel good about their immune protection\n\n\n\n \nVoices of reason in this space [2:28:45]\n\nZDoggMD is a fan of Dr. Monica Gandhi, UCSF infectious disease\n\nShe is very much obsessed with getting us back to living instead of living in fear all the time \nShe’s a pragmatist, very, very smart and data driven\n\n\nMarty replies, “There’s really just one person. And that’s Dr. Anthony Fauci.” \n\nHe’s a true gentleman \nMarty has had different opinions on how to manage the COVID strategy\n\n\nMarty agrees that Monica Gandhi is terrific\nAmesh Adalja from Johns Hopkins has been correct on India and Delta and so many other things\n\nHe was previously on this podcast, #106 – Amesh Adalja, M.D.: Comparing COVID-19 to past pandemics, preparing for the future, and reasons for optimism\n\n\nMartin Kulldorf from Harvard who is now with the Brownstone Institute puts out great information\n\n“And I would say more importantly, I do not listen to anyone. Who’s a politically pointed physician, anyone the current past or future, if someone trying to become a politically appointed physician or was I just block them right out. And I go to these go-to people who I trust” – Marty Makary\n\nZDoggMD adds a couple more; he will go to someone who is very politically angled on social media, who takes strong stances, but he doesn’t give them blanket trust\n\nHe is a big fan of John Mandola on Twitter; he’s a cardiologist\nDavid Katz from Yale is good at looking at the big picture; he’s very rational\n\n\n\n \nStrong convictions, loosely held: the value in questioning your own beliefs [2:32:15]\n\nPeter notes the type of person who he doesn’t believe is one who says the same exact thing over and over, that doesn’t feel differently about this now versus 6 months ago or 18 months ago\nSchool closures last year are a good example, he doesn’t believe anyone who doesn’t think we got that wrong\nSomething ZDoggMD points out when he talks about the alt middle is, “you should be able to question every single one of your beliefs because there’s really, you know, if you’re sticking to one single view there, you’re probably missing something”\nIt gives credibility when someone says they were wrong about something for these reasons, and this is how their thinking has changed\nA hedge fund manager who is never willing to change their point of view in the presence of new information is going to end up losing money\nIt helps to be malleable based on the available data\nIn medicine the reward is uncoupled from the outcome and this creates mass confusion\n\nIt’s difficult to sort out the really good critical thinkers\nZDoggMD agrees that people would benefit from  having the endpoint sync with their thinking\nIt’s hard to know what the outcomes are for improving healthcare; what is the endpoint?\n\n\nTherapies have constantly pivoted in response to new information\n\nThe doctor may think a patient was not going to benefit from steroids, but when they do, they continue the steroid treatment\n\n\nMarty notes the thing that irks him, thinking of criticism of government is when someone is called a flip flop\n\nA good response should be constantly changing\n\n\nZDoggMD asks, “How are you going to persuade somebody of something you think is important based on the data that you have if you do not show them that you’re flexible in your thinking, but firm in your convictions, loosely held and that new data would change your mind?” \n\nThis flexibility is needed\n\n\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialPrevious podcast with Marty Makary: #68 – Marty Makary, M.D.: The US healthcare system—why it’s broken, steps to fix it, and how to protect yourself | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com)  \nPrevious podcast with Zubin Damania: #37 – Zubin Damania, M.D.: Revolutionizing healthcare one hilariously inspiring video at a time | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com) \nCollection of information on COVID-19 on PeterAttiaMD.com: Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) Information: Podcasts & Articles on SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 | Peter Attia, peterattiamd.com \nPrevious podcasts on COVID: \n\n#97 – Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.: COVID-19: transmissibility, vaccines, risk reduction, and treatment | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com) \n#98 – Peter Attia, M.D. and Paul Grewal, M.D.: Coronavirus (COVID-19) FAQ | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com) \n#99 – Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.: Continuing the conversation on COVID-19 | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com) \n#100 – Sam Harris, Ph.D.: COVID-19—Comprehending the crisis and managing our emotions | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com) \n#102 – Michael Osterholm, Ph.D.: COVID-19—Lessons learned, challenges ahead, and reasons for optimism and concern | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com) \n#106 – Amesh Adalja, M.D.: Comparing COVID-19 to past pandemics, preparing for the future, and reasons for optimism | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com)  \n#104 – COVID-19 for kids with Olivia Attia | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com)  \n#105 – Paul Conti, M.D.: The psychological toll of a pandemic, and the societal problems it has highlighted | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com)  \n#107 – John Barry: 1918 Spanish flu pandemic—historical account, parallels to today, and lessons | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com)  \n#115 – David Watkins, Ph.D.: A masterclass in immunology, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine strategies for COVID-19 | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com)  \n#117 – Stanley Perlman, M.D., Ph.D.: Insights from a coronavirus expert on COVID-19 | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com)  \n#123 – Joan Mannick, M.D. & Nir Barzilai, M.D.: Rapamycin and metformin—longevity, immune enhancement, and COVID-19 | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com)  \n#137 – Paul Offit, M.D.: An expert perspective on COVID-19 vaccines | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com)  \n#159 – Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.: Evolution of the anti-vaccine movement, the causes of autism, and COVID-19 vaccine state of affairs | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com) \n#160 – Paul Offit, M.D.: The latest on COVID-19 vaccines and their safety, herd immunity, and viral variants | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com)  \n#169 – Katherine Eban: COVID-19 Lab Leak: Examining all sides of the debate and discussing barriers to a full investigation | The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (peterattiamd.com) \n\nPosts on COVID-19 from PeterAttiaMD.com:\n\nCOVID-19: How to interpret screening tests: video, spreadsheet, and primer | Peter Attia, peterattiamd.com (April 14, 2020)\nCOVID-19: What’s wrong with the models? | Peter Attia, peterattiamd.com (April 20, 2020)\nSARS-CoV-2 and the host response: psychological stress | Peter Attia, peterattiamd.com (June 7, 2020)\nCOVID framework: How does this thing end? | Peter Attia, peterattiamd.com (June 21, 2020)\nMasking emotion in the age of COVID-19 | Peter Attia, peterattiamd.com (November 15, 2020)\nCOVID-19: A few things worth checking out: 12-13-2020 | Peter Attia, peterattiamd.com (December 13, 2020)\nBritain’s COVID-19 vaccine gamble;
