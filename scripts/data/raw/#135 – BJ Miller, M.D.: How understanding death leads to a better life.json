  "title": "#135 – BJ Miller, M.D.: How understanding death leads to a better life",
  "content": "BJ Miller is a hospice and palliative care specialist on a quest to reframe our relationship with death. In this episode, BJ begins with how his own brush with death radically shifted his perspective and ultimately forged his path towards palliative care and helping patients integrate and understand their life in a meaningful way. BJ recounts several moving stories from his patients, which reveal important lessons about overcoming the fear of death, letting go of regret, and what’s most important in life. He discusses the major design flaws of a “death phobic” healthcare system. Furthermore, he makes the case that seeing death as a part of life allows us to live well, as opposed to living to evade death itself. He concludes with a discussion around physician-assisted death as well as his hopes around the use of psychedelics to reduce suffering in end-of-life care.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#135 - BJ Miller, M.D.: How understanding death leads to a better life\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#135 - BJ Miller, M.D.: How understanding death leads to a better life\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#135 - BJ Miller, M.D.: How understanding death leads to a better life\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nBJ’s accident leading to the loss of his limbs and his experience inside a burn unit [3:00];\nCoping with his amputations—being tough, the grieving process, and the healing properties of tears [14:30];\nGoing from art history to medical school: the value of a diverse background in medicine [28:15];\nHow BJ’s new body liberated him [40:00];\nHow losing his sister to suicide and his disillusionment with medicine altered his path [47:15];\nDiscovering his path of palliative care—distinct from hospice—in medicine [55:30];\nOur complicated relationship with death, and how acknowledging it can release its grip and improve living [1:02:15];\nThe different distinctions around the fear of death, and how BJ helps his patients negotiate fears [1:10:00];\nThe major design flaws of a “death phobic” healthcare system [1:14:15];\nCommon regrets, the value of time, and other insights from interactions with patients in their final moments of life [1:23:00];\nThe story of Randy Sloan—a case study of playing life out [1:33:45];\nHastening death with physician-assisted dying: Legality and considerations [1:39:45];\nThe use of psychedelics in end-of-life care, and what BJ is most excited about going forward [1:45:45];

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

It is a wholly unnatural place. I mean, nature is completely kept at bay.” —BJ Miller on the working conditions inside a burn unit\nA burn unit is a very different place that requires specialized doctors and nurses\n\nThe grotesque nature of the disfiguration of the skin\nThese dressing changes several times per day on a patient require incredible sterility at the bedside\nEven the smell of burned tissue is a very foreign odor to people\n\nRisk of infection\n\nInfection is very often the thing that kills people, hence all the sterility\nSomeone might look just fine, but their survival odds can be quite low because their body is so susceptible to infection\nThere is no touching allowed (hard for BJ and his parents)\n\n \nCoping with his amputations—being tough, the grieving process, and the healing properties of tears [14:30]\nWhy the need to amputate limbs?\n\nWhen fasciotomies are performed initially, it’s with the hope of salvaging the limbs\nThey came to the realization trying to salvage the limbs was actually going to threaten BJ’s life due to infection\n\nThe conversation with the surgeon\n\nOne night, BJ had a memory of the conversation regarding amputation with the surgeon\nWhen he awoke the next morning, he was in a daze and remembers thinking, “Thank god that was just a dream.”\nIn his hazy state, BJ managed to extubate himself, put out the central lines in this neck, get out of bed and start to walk to the bathroom\nAbout halfway there, the catheter line ran out of slack and it yanked on the Foley, “that’s a pain that I won’t soon forget.”\nAt that point, clarity hit him—he knew at that point that the amputation conversation wasn’t a dream\n\n“It was instantaneous that I realized this wasn’t a dream. And all the relief that I had experienced moments ago in the other direction just immediately went away, and I was very, very clear where I was and what was happening to me. Instantaneously. It was a wild, wild moment I won’t soon forget.” —BJ Miller\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14503\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo-of-BJ-bjmiller-750x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo-of-BJ-bjmiller-750x1024.png 750w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo-of-BJ-bjmiller-220x300.png 220w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo-of-BJ-bjmiller-768x1049.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo-of-BJ-bjmiller.png 1012w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" />\nFigure 1. Photo of BJ’s new body. Image credit: dailymail.co.uk\nBJ’s process of mourning the loss of his limbs\n\nHis conscious mourning process was delayed, he thought the thing to do was to pick yourself up, be tough, and get back on the horse, “The less you acknowledge what’s gone on, the better. The tougher you are, the faster you’ll be functional again.”\nWeird level of immediate acceptance: BJ’s mom has been disabled due to polio her whole life, so in his first conversation with her was almost an excitement to be able to relate with her, “now we have so much more in common”\nIt wasn’t a thorough acceptance, “It was where I wanted to be, but it wasn’t really where I was.”\nHe was on autopilot in a way\n\nFirst time he let it out—\n\nA nurse one day urged BJ to let his real feelings out, told him she was sick of him not taking this seriously and acting too cheery, “This is a big, big deal. You’re not being real.”\nBJ began to cry, like a dam had been broken, “It was the most magical thing.”\nTears as a form of anesthesia? BJ had a fascinating moment when crying, he felt no physical pain\nIt was a fascinating moment, and the beginning of a long process of months and years of mourning and grieving\n\nWhat was the underlying source of BJ’s sadness and tears?\n\nA release of the physical pain: “I had just been literally gritting my teeth and trying to feel or act as strong”\nShame and embarrassment: The sorrow came a bit from embarrassment for doing this and putting his parents through so much pain\nFear of going through life disabled: would ever have sex again, what women were going to think of me, what my friends would think of me, he has seen the cruelty towards diabled people before\nVery low on the list was the “Why me?” questions: if anything, he felt guilty for having too perfect a life before that\n\n \nGoing from art history to medical school: the value of a diverse background in medicine [28:15]\nHow the death of his sister altered his path\n\nBJ had a sister who was 4 years older than him\nHe really looked up to her and found her to be a very insightful person, “Wild, brilliant, fascinating, just intense person.”\nBJ says he “chased her moods around. Anything she told me, I took at face value. I mean, she owned me in so many ways as her younger brother.”\nTurns out she was also very troubled\nRoughly 10 years after BJ’s accident, his sister committed suicide\nAt the time, BJ was in medical school and this event precipitated his decision to leave medicine\n\nHow BJ decided to go into medicine\n\nWhile in recovery, BJ said it was “like a torture chamber interspersed with incredible boredom”\nHe spent a lot of time pondering questions of meaning and identity in a way that was very relevant and therapeutic and practical: “What am I now? Am I less of a person? Do I have less to offer the world?”\nHe was looking for meaning-making—\n\ni.e., how humans work with pain, how did humans work with things they can’t control\n\n\nThis led to his fascination with art — It’s kind of a stunning impulse that human beings have—“That was lighting up for me as very important and telling and that maybe, maybe the art world had something to teach me.”\nHe returned to Princeton and switched his major to art history\n\n*Advice for college students on what to study prior to med school:\n\nPeter’s general advice: Anything but pre-med\nPeter values a diverse background\nAnd most of everything you study in pre-med, you’re going to pick up in medical school anyway\nBJ agrees, “If you’re going to go into the healing professions, the clinical professions, you better find a way to delve into why life is amazing and horrifying”\nquestions around meaning and identity have been “crowded out” of healthcare\nBJ says he really, really loves the notion of people who study humanities then going into the healing professions\n\n⇒ Peter gave his thoughts on this topic in AMA #3 and the episode with David Epstein\nThe medical field benefits from physicians with a wide range of backgrounds—\n\nMedicine needs all of the above: People who have probably gone incredibly deep on a very narrow subset of science, engineering backgrounds, humanities backgrounds, etc.\nPre-med is not bad, says BJ: “Just make sure you actually love it. Just make sure you love the nuts and bolts so you’re not just doing chemistry just as a means to the end of medical school. You find something to study that actually cultivates you loving something—I think that’s a major, major distinction—that could be engineering, that could be art, that could be chemistry.”\n\n \nHow BJ’s new body liberated him [40:00] \n“One of the ways to get through something in some real ways to let yourself be changed by it.” —BJ Miller\nDeciding to pursue medicine\n\nAfter graduating with an art history degree, BJ decided to go to medical school \nBJ’s goal was NOT to not get back to where I was before the injuries, but rather let those experiences and lessons shape his path forward in a positive way\nMedicine lit up as a way to put these experiences to use—\n\n“I could apply these lessons into a therapeutic application of studying perspective and meaning-making.”\n“I was actively looking for an outlet where my injuries weren’t something that someone would look past or forgive, but were actually in some way something of an advantage.”\n\n\n\nHow did BJ’s injuries liberated him\n\nGrowing up, BJ had a sense that his life was almost too easy based on how others around him had it rough (mom with polio, sister with mental health issues)\n\n“My problem was I didn’t really have anything to complain about. I knew that life was really, really hard for many, many people and internally my life was hard.”\n\n\nAfter his injuries, he almost felt more comfortable in his new body— “I got the body that much more mirrored how I felt inside; fragmented, broken, confused, unintegrated, different.”\nThis mental process of accepting his new body, that it was the “right” body for him, really removed the sense of regret and second guessing he otherwise would’ve felt\n\n \nHow losing his sister to suicide and his disillusionment with medicine altered his path [47:15] \nHis sister’s suicide\n\nAfter his sister’s suicide, she was diagnosed as having textbook bipolar disorder\nBut even leading up to her death, she had everyone fooled including BJ, his parents, and even her therapist of 10 years—“she was a master manipulator”\nBefore her death, BJ believed his sister was right about everything, “I saw Lisa was the standard. She was right. Everyone else was wrong.”\nHis sister’s death led BJ to consider leaving medicine—he was demoralized that he was someone who wanted to heal people and yet he completely missed his sister’s diagnosis right under his nose\n\nHow BJ found his path in medicine\n\nBJ has originally thought his path was going to be rehabilitation for people with traumatic injuries\nBut soon into his residency he realized he hated it\nThe whole idea of rehabilitation bothered him—\n\nIt was so mechanical had nothing to do with the personal transformations\nThe goal was  to get people back to where they were before the injury\n“I just don’t believe is true. It’s importantly untrue.”\n\n\n\nHow his relationship with fear had changed:\n\nAfter his injuries, he was much less afraid of failure\n\n“I had a totally different relationship with fear. I saw falling as a skill.” —BJ Miller\nReady to leave medicine:\n\nGoing into medical school, he had promised himself he wouldn’t get stuck in something he didn’t like, life is too short\nHe had also begun to be disillusioned with medicine–where the practice of medicine isn’t necessarily jiving with the ideals that you bring into it\nThe dean talked him into doing his internship and he reluctantly agreed\nIt was at that time that he stumbled into palliative care, “And that’s where everything changed”\n\n \nDiscovering his path of palliative care—distinct from hospice—in medicine [55:30] \nDiscovering palliative care\n\nBJ thought he understood what hospice was—simply where people go for the final days of lif\nThen one day he stumbled into an elective called “palliative care” at the Medical College of Wisconsin\nDr. David Weissman was the oncologist there\n\nOn this day, BJ witnessed a conversation that was a transformative moment for him:\n\nDr. Weissman was having a conversation with a woman and he was trying to convey the serious nature of her heart condition\nIt was type of tricky conversations that medicine traditionally doesn’t handle very well—very emotional, psychologically loaded content\n“He’s talking to her like a human being, not hovering over her like a superior, someone who’s there to fix her. It was beautiful.”\nThe magic moment came when he looked at the patient in the eye and said, “When you die…”\nBJ was moved by how Dr. Weissman “dared to acknowledge this woman’s death”\nAnd on her face was not shock or anger, but relief \nAt that point, BJ knew that THIS was what he had been looking for\n\nIn the world of palliative care…\n\nIllness, disability, death are normal, they’re not anomalous\nIt’s not just the angle of the joint it was concerned with, but the angle of the thoughts and the way that we see ourselves\nThe words we choose to describe our place in the world and how we either suffer for those words or how we really can find ourselves doing something more therapeutic\n\n“I’m not here to fix people, I’m here to be with people as they find their way and to deal with things that they can’t control. That was the hook for me.” —BJ Miller\nDifference between palliative care and hospice\nPalliative care in BJ’s words—\n\nPalliative care is simply the interdisciplinary pursuit of the quality of life\nWithin the context of serious illness palliative care is that mode of care which helps you feel as well as possible—Emotionally, physically, spiritually\nThere is nothing in the definition of palliative care that makes it that you need be dying anytime soon—Death is included in this, but it’s not the focus.\nThe thing that we treat in palliative care is suffering, not disease\n\nHospice care in BJ’s words—\n\nHospice is a subset of palliative care—it is essentially palliative care that’s applied at the end of life\nThat is a huge distinction — yet because many think palliative care and hospice are the same, nobody wants to talk about palliative care because of all the baggage around death\n\nSuffering is the consequence of conflating these terms—\n\nThe consequence of conflating the two is that people suffer for years where they could get a lot more support through palliative care\n\n“They think [palliative care] is only relevant if you’re dying soon, and nothing could be farther from the truth.” —BJ Miller\n \nOur complicated relationship with death, and how acknowledging it can release its grip and improve living [1:02:15] \nOur complicated relationship with death\n\nEven though all of us are going to die, it seems we don’t live like that is a reality\nWe are almost in denial, or just have an inability to look at death\nBJ says it understandable and that we should cut ourselves some slack\nWe are wired to run away from death\nWe’re also the only species who is aware of our own eventual mortality\nIt’s quite a predicament we humans have, it’s a huge subject for us to wrap our heads around\n\nA victim of our own success—due to advancing technologies and medicine, we’ve been able to extend lifespan and forestall death\n\nSo now that sense of urgency is lessened\nPut all that stuff together and we’ve conspired to set up a pretty tricky relationship to this piece of our nature\n\n“People die much more miserable than they need to because they haven’t dared to look at this thing called death before it’s too late.” —BJ Miller\nLife is precious specifically because we die\n\nThanks to our technology, you can kind of live forever by some very reduced definition of life\nOnce you look at death and really accept it as a reality, two things happen:\n\n1) You many realize it’s not so terrifying afterall\n2) Once you come to terms with the fact that your time is limited and therefore precious, it has a secondary effect of helping you really, really appreciate what you have\n\n\n\n“The fact that it ends is what makes it precious.” —BJ Miller\nWe can do both\n\nWe don’t have to pick between maximizing our lifespan and accepting death\nInstead, we can figure out a way to live the best life possible and the longest life possible \nAs long as we think it’s either life or death, that either you love life and try everything you can do to extend it, or you love death and just completely accept that it’s going to come today\nThese false dichotomies are the problem\n\n \nThe different distinctions around the fear of death, and how BJ helps his patients negotiate fears [1:10:00]\nThe different types of fear of death\nMany of BJ’s patient present with a fear of death, but there’s an important distinction—\n\nAre you afraid of the dying process?\nOr are you afraid of being dead?\n\nIn the former, \n\nthere are medications to help the body come down for a “gentle landing” (i.e., not suffer in physical pain)\nSo if that’s your fear, BJ offers his patients reassurance\n\nIf you fear is about being dead – what happens next, leaving your family behind, missing out, etc.\n\nIn this case, there is no clear “answer”\nBut “as a fellow traveler, I can accompany you there. We can think about that together. We can talk about it and then we can make a life that responds to that big question.”\n\nExamples: \n\nIf someone is worried about “judgement day”, then the solution is to help them behave differently in the time they have left\nIf someone’s fear is not living forever, “my favorite means to living forever is to think about the world beyond yourself; invest yourself in the world beyond yourself so when your self dies, that thing you love keeps going.”\n\n“This is where it gets really, really fascinating, the relationship between self and other and what to do about that. Religious thinking, spiritual pursuits, this is what can open up when you admit that you’re freaked out to be dead.” —BJ Miller\nPeter’s personal fear is around leaving his family behind, and missing out on the future generations\n\nBJ’s point is that you CAN live through those things, but you have to make the investment, it doesn’t happen automatically\nThe irony is that you have to do it while you’re still alive and well, you can’t wait until your last moments\n\nPalliative care should really begin much earlier in life\n\n“It’s such a shame that we forestall and keep it at bay when it’s this thing that could help us so, so much.”\n“Whether actually a palliative care referral or a palliative care mindset, but one way or another finding our way into this subject while we’ve got plenty of road in front of us, is absolutely the right, best way.”\n\n \nThe major design flaws of a “death phobic” healthcare system [1:14:15]\nThe big design flaw of medicine\n\nThe overarching design flaw is that the system is focused on disease, not on the people dealing with disease\nThe second you make it about the person living with the disease, not the disease itself, you welcome in all sorts of things into the mix beyond just their physiology and anatomy:\n\nTheir social, emotional, and spiritual lives\nYou’ve welcomed your humanness into the mix as a clinician being relevant beyond just your technical skills\n\nThis can help with doctor burnout\nIt also helps with the expectation management—doctors can not be expected to work miracles: “We know that at some day everyone’s going to die and that that’s not a failure for us.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Once we align healthcare with the human condition and with serving human beings, so much of the trouble will work itself out.” —BJ Miller\nPalliative care should be apart of everything\n\nGiven that 100% of patients die eventually, you’d think that palliative care would not need to be a specialty, it would be baked into how all of medicine works.\nThe healthcare system itself can’t keep doing what it’s doing and can’t keep death the enemy, because it’s going to lose that war again and again and again.\n\nThe wrong strategy and misaligned resources\n\nPeter says we’ve taken the wrong strategy in a war that probably ought to be deemed more of a truce\nWe’ve put our resources in the wrong place\nmedicine is very good is on acute care and really bad with chronic care\nAnd it has nothing to do with healthy life to prevent acute or chronic issues\nAnd it has nothing to do with death\nSo, why do we keep doing that?\n\nIn many cases, we don’t know what to do to prevent the condition\nAnd even the ones that we do understand, like obesity, we don’t really have the infrastructure to help with prevention\n\n\nIn med school, for example…\n\nThere isn’t a single course on dying\nNot a single course on nutrition or exercise or stress management\nOr the psychology of eating and our relationship to food and how you can help patients make better choices with nutrition and things like that\n\nFrankly physicians aren’t compensated for those types of things—You just don’t have the billable structure in which you can do these things\nInstead we focus on the drugs as our main tools, and drugs just aren’t good for the chronic conditions\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarizing the 3 design flaws of healthcare:\n1 – We’re death phobic and we see ourselves as victors when we cure something\n\nBut chronic illness by definition is something that we can’t fix\nThis presents doctors with a sense of failure, which becomes an emotional barrier to developing it further\n\n2 – The busy-ness of medicine\n\nMedicine is a series of transactions, which can work in acute care\nBut with chronic care, you’ve got to learn to live with it so illness and health becomes protracted over time \nTherefore chronic care becomes an experience, yet we’re wired for transactions so we don’t have the systems and structures in place to be cultivating experiences together with our patients.\n\n3 – Reimbursement: Doctors are incentivized away from thinking about care over time\n \nCommon regrets, the value of time, and other insights from interactions with patients in their final moments of life [1:23:00]\nCommon regrets from hospice patients\n\nBJ has had many of these intimate deathbed moments\nOf course, he sees the common regrets like wishing they had spent more time with family that at work\nBut in most cases, the patient is dying from a chronic illness so they’ve had some protracted period of time to think about our death specifically\nBy the later stages of their life, their regrets show up more often in wishing as:\n\nI wish I had dared to love more. \nI wish I hadn’t been so afraid. \nI wish I had just let myself be myself. \nI wish I hadn’t been so hard on myself or criticized myself.\n\n\nThe commonality is that they wish they had let themselves come to terms with death earlier in their lives, because it would have changed the decisions they made\n\nThis is the freedom of coming to grips with death: \n\nIf “failure” is guaranteed, the pressure is OFF to live perfectly (always being a good person, eating veggies, not smoking, etc.”\nIn parallel, the pressure is ON to take life seriously and be yourself\n\nA liberating force\n\n“The only thing I have to lose is wasting my time, so I’m not going to waste my time. I’m going to take this stuff seriously. I’m going to say what I want to say to people. I’m going to do what I want to do.”\nAccepting the inevitability of death is a way of forgiving yourself for “failing”\n\n“In this way, it can be a real liberating force… and the regrets have something to do with not coming to that place sooner.” —BJ Miller\nAddressing the dying wishes of patients\n\nBJ works with the Dream Foundation—an organization that helps make those wishes come true\nVisiting the Grand Canyon, for example\n“It’s beautiful” says BJ\nHelping fulfill those wishes is SOME of BJ’s job, and when it’s practical to do so, “It’s fun. It’s great work. It’s powerful. It’s delightful and it’s stunning.”\nHowever, BJ finds himself more commonly helping patients see themselves in the world in such a way that they can let go of those things that they never got to, because they realize the things that they’re not going to get to is a very long list.\n“On a developmental level, you’ve got to find a way to come to terms with all the things you’re not going to get to do. That’s where I spend a lot of my time.”\n\nAre people become enlightened and hyper transcendent at the end of life?\n\nOftentimes, patients are so heavily medicated that they’re not really even able to communicate much with their loved ones—It’s the price we’ll pay to keep them comfortable\nThe last day or two of life is not necessarily the greatest time to be digging into someone’s soul\nBut it’s not an either/or situation—meaning take drugs and be out of it but pain free  OR don’t take drugs and be in pain but be lucid\nIntractable pain is a great route to delirium—when your body is an absolute agony is a pretty quick psychotic experience\n\nThreading the needle with palliative care:\n\nPalliative care doctors can often “thread a needle” and get someone comfortable enough, but not so overly medicated that they can’t interact\nBut in the very final moments of life, you’re not having big philosophical conversations\nThis is the best argument as to why there is no time like the present to say what it is you want to say to people who matter\n\n“There is no time like the present to say what it is you want to say to people who matter.” —BJ Miller\n \nThe story of Randy Sloan—a case study of playing life out [1:33:45]\nMeeting Randy Sloan\n\nBJ had a dream of riding a motorcycle which was a challenge given his amputations\nRandy Sloan was a young mechanic who gladly took on the challenge of fitting BJ on his own bike\nAfter modifying the bike, BJ had a “beautiful moment” where he was able to ride off into the sunset on his own\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14501\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BJ-Miller-on-bike-1024x763.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"763\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BJ-Miller-on-bike-1024x763.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BJ-Miller-on-bike-300x223.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BJ-Miller-on-bike-768x572.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BJ-Miller-on-bike.png 1192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 2.

Randy Sloan. Image credit: nytimes.com\nPalliative care for Randy\n\nRandy immediately moved into the Zen Hospice Project where BJ worked at the time where he played out the rest of his life\nBJ had the sobering conversation with Randy that there was nothing that was going to help them at this point, except for love\nIn that conversation, BJ asked Randy, “what are you most proud of in yourself?”\nWithout hesitation, Randy replied, “I want everybody I ever come into contact to know that I love them.”\n\nFrom there the next steps became clear:\n\nWe need to keep you as comfortable and conscious as possible for what time you have \nLet’s get you into this hospice house and out of the charade of treatment\nLet’s treat your symptoms and open up your door and get as many people in here as you want\n\nAnd that’s what he did…\n\nHe just had a steady stream of visitors. \n“He became this radiant beam of love for what time he had and just made sure to love as many people as he humanly could.”\n“That became his legacy. And he died smiling and quickly.”\n\n \nHastening death with physician-assisted dying: Legality and considerations [1:39:45]\nLegality of assisted dying\n\nPhysician-assisted dying (aka euthanasia) has been legalized in a handful of states (See list of states here)\nThe process includes writing a letter for approval, there’s a 2 week wait, you have to have two physicians involved, etc.\nThis is in place as a fail safe so that people don’t do something in a moment of weakness—\n\n“It’s almost like once you pierce the veil of indefinite life, which people really long for, on some levels think they long for, then all of a sudden they’re terminal. And then they can’t die soon enough.”\nIt’s the ‘quit before getting fired impulse’, says BJ\n\n\n\nIn the case of someone like Randy…\n\nBJ says if hastening death was an option for Randy, he could imagine him taking that route given that the world was falling apart so quickly and it was just too painful mentally and physically for a little while there for Randy to “see straight”\nBut the realization that Randy had a mission to sort of prove love, to show love, to be love, he then had a reason to keep going\nRather than choose assisted dying, Randy had a lot more final moments with friends and he had the pride of playing his body all the way out\n\n“A meaningful life, a good life, is not the absence of suffering. Suffering teaches us too much. It’s too important of a vehicle for us actually. A full life requires it.” —BJ Miller\nBJ has nothing against those who choose to hasten death\n\nFor some people, it is exactly the right decision—but only when it is seen as a meaningful response, not a flight from suffering, but a moving towards something meaningful—And for some people that final act of will is very meaningful\nBut more often, what ends up being more meaningful for people is:\n\nBeing more than their pain and suffering\nLetting their body play itself all the way out and dealing with and adapting every moment along the way\nAnd letting themselves grow right up until the moment of their death \n\n\n“That’s actually a more meaningful pursuit for the bulk of people.”\n\n“In general, I’d rather feel something—even if it’s pain—than feel nothing. Anesthesia is a way, numbness is a way to die before we have to die. That seems to be a bigger tragedy to me than is death in the first place.” —BJ Miller\n \nThe use of psychedelics in end-of-life care, and what BJ is most excited about going forward [1:45:45]\nTherapeutic psychedelics\n\nPsilocybin has been shown to help with depression in patients with cancer\nMDMA is currently being used to treat PTSD\n\nCheck out the Rick Doblin episode for more on this topic\nAlso see this article about a soldier who overcame PTSD with MDMA \n\n\nKetamine is also proving to be a therapeutic for depression\n\nPsychedelics in end of life care\n\nThese same substances are being researched for anxieties around the fears of death in a patient population dealing with terminal illness or serious illness\n\n⇒ BJ says the psilocybin data is the most exciting:\n\nPeople who are gripped by a fear of death, gripped by a sense of meaninglessness and not belonging and not feeling connected come out of one sessions losing their fear of death, feeling part of something larger than themselves, having a totally different relationship to fear\nThe effect lasts for a months suggesting it’s not just an acute chemical response\n\n“We don’t have anything remotely like this to offer in medicine.” say BJ\nWhat is BJ most excited about?\n\nBJ is most excited about conversations, like this one with Peter, that are moving the conversation beyond just medicine\nOne of the great things that happens when we focus on the person is that people in the field of medicine can become part of something larger than ourselves\n\nPhysicians can partner with architects and artists, designers, and other disciplines\nOr even death doulas and quasi medical folks and the alternative and integrative medicine folks. \nAll of a sudden, we are part of a much larger family working on behalf of something much larger than even medicine\n\n\n\n“Death has become a medical issue. It doesn’t belong there. Suffering and death are way bigger than medicine. . .medicine doesn’t have to carry all that water by itself. People are going to start taking care of people and not handing themselves over to doctors to do the trick.” —BJ Miller\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialBJ’s TED Talk: What really matters at the end of life | BJ Miller | TED (youtube.com) [1:15]\nPeter explaining the value in a major other than pre-med for college students considering med school: [35:15]\n\nAt 38:00 in this AMA episode: #26 – AMA #3: supplements, women’s health, patient care, and more | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com)\nAt  1:41:15 in this episode: #96 – David Epstein: How a range of experience leads to better performance in a highly specialized world | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com)\n\nOrganization that helps bring dying wishes to fruition: Dream Foundation | (dreamfoundation.org) [1:29:00]\nHospice where BJ worked: Zen Hospice Project | (zencaregiving.org) [1:37:15]\nStates that have legalized some form of physician assisted dying: Assisted suicide in the United States | (wikipedia.org) [1:40:00]\nResearch on psilocybin for depression in patients with life-threatening cancer: Psilocybin produces substantial and sustained decreases in depression and anxiety in patients with life-threatening cancer: A randomized double-blind trial (Griffiths et al., 2016)[1:45:45]\nMDMA is being used to treat PTSD: PRESS RELEASE: FDA Grants Breakthrough Therapy Designation for MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD, Agrees on Special Protocol Assessment for Phase 3 Trials | (maps.org) [1:46:00]\n\nCheck out the Rick Doblin episode for more on MDMA for PTSD: #65 – Rick Doblin, Ph.D.: MDMA — the creation, scheduling, toxicity, therapeutic use, and changing public opinion of what is possibly the single most important synthetic molecule ever created by our species | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com)\nSoldier who overcame PTSD with MDMA: ‘Feel-good drug’ Ecstasy one step closer to approval as PTSD treatment | (stripes.com) \n\nKetamine recently approved for depression: FDA approves new nasal spray medication for treatment-resistant depression; available only at a certified doctor’s office or clinic | (fda.gov) [1:46:30]\nPsilocybin can help with fear of death with one guided session: Use of the Classic Hallucinogen Psilocybin for Treatment of Existential Distress Associated with Cancer (Grob et al., 2013) [1:46:45]\n§People Mentioned\nRandy Sloan [1:33:45]\n\n§<img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bio-image-bjmiller-500x500.png\" class=\"section--guest__image img--circle alignright\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bio-image-bjmiller-500x500.png 500w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bio-image-bjmiller-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" />BJ Miller, M.D.BJ Miller is an author, TED speaker, and physician.
