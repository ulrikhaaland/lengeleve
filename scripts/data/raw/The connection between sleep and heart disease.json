Actual and predicted acute myocardial infarction (AMI) counts for the week after the spring daylight savings time (DST) time changes.

He subsequently became a Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, USA. Currently, he is Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, USA. He is also the founder and director of the Center for Human Sleep Science. \nDr. Walker’s research examines the impact of sleep on human health and disease. He has received numerous funding awards from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, and is a Kavli Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences.\nDr. Walker is the author of the International Bestseller, Why We Sleep. It has a singular goal: to reunite humanity with sleep.\nIn addition, Dr. Walker is an internationally recognized speaker, a successful entrepreneur, and a Sleep Scientist for Google. \n[sleepdiplomat.com]\nTwitter: @sleepdiplomat\nCenter for Human Sleep Science: https://www.humansleepscience.com/\nMatthew’s publications: https://www.humansleepscience.com/p-u-b-l-i-c-a-t-i-o-n-s"
