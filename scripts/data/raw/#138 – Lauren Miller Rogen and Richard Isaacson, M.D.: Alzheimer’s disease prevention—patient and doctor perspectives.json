In this episode, Lauren tells the heartbreaking story of watching members of her family succumb to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) which motivated her to proactively address her own risk with Richard’s guidance. Richard discusses the various genetic and lifestyle factors that influence the risk of AD and uses Lauren’s unique situation to explain how he diagnoses patients and personalizes care. They go through Lauren’s protocol of preventative measures that have already produced marked results, and end with the uplifting message that one’s genetic predisposition does not seal one’s fate.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#138 - Lauren Miller Rogen and Richard Isaacson, M.D.: Alzheimer’s disease prevention—patient and doctor perspectives\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#138 - Lauren Miller Rogen and Richard Isaacson, M.D.: Alzheimer’s disease prevention—patient and doctor perspectives\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#138 - Lauren Miller Rogen and Richard Isaacson, M.D.: Alzheimer’s disease prevention—patient and doctor perspectives\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nLauren’s deep family history of Alzheimer’s disease (3:10);\nThe influence of genetics, epigenetics, and lifestyle on Alzheimer’s disease risk (13:45);\nLauren’s mother’s disease progression and the enormous stress it causes for family members (24:30);\nThe various manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease depending on the location of pathology (29:30);\nThe three stages of Alzheimer’s disease (34:45);\nRichard’s deep exploration into Lauren’s family history revealing clues about a diagnosis and a roadmap to successful disease mitigation (39:15);\nHow exercise reduces Alzheimer’s disease risk, and the different risk between males and females (58:00);\nWhy knowing your APOE status is important, and whether certain people should be wearier of head trauma (1:08:00);\nHow Richard uses genetic testing to personalize care (1:14:45);\nThe “ABCs” of Alzheimer’s prevention, lifestyle interventions, and Lauren’s personal protocol for reducing her risk (1:21:45);\nUnique treatment for people with the ApoE4 variant (1:36:30);\nRichard’s mixed opinion on CBD and THC as a tool for disease prevention (1:40:00);\nCognitive testing procedures, and how Lauren’s tests furthered her commitment to her disease prevention protocol (1:41:45);\nThe relevance of sense of smell and hearing in Alzheimer’s disease risk and prevention (1:50:00);\nThe emotional benefit of knowing you have control over your mental and physical health (1:57:30);\nHFC—a charitable organization founded by Lauren and Seth (2:00:15);

She was scared for me and my brother and my dad, because I think she got that at some point she may not know what’s happening, and that the weight would be on us.”\nDevastating consequences:\n\nAt this point, Lauren was a young adult and just beginning to interact with her mother as a friend more so than a mom\nBeing deprived of the opportunity to develop this friendship with her mother was very difficult for Lauren\nLauren was intent on finding a way to help her mother, but despite her best efforts, she found nothing\n\n\n\n“There was nothing. And so it was a really scary, hard time where I felt like I could do nothing and that this train had left the station for my mom and that was it.” —Lauren Miller Rogen\n \nThe influence of genetics, epigenetics, and lifestyle on Alzheimer’s disease risk [13:45]\nRichard’s perspective on Alzheimer’s disease\n\nRichard sees it as an insidious disease – he “hates” it because it not only robs the person with it of who they are, but also robs the entire family\nAlzheimer’s begins in the brain about a decade before the first symptoms of memory loss, and this is something many doctors are still unaware of\nOnset of Alzheimer’s symptoms usually occurs in one’s seventies, but with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, symptoms can begin in one’s forties or fifties\nWhile genetics is often responsible for an early onset of Alzheimer’s disease, Richard points out that there are cases when there is more to the story that can cause an earlier onset (lifestyle, head trauma, comorbidities, etc.)\n\nRichard suspects this might be the case with Lauren’s family – “there’s a one plus one equals three here”\n\n\n\n“… could it be lifestyle? Could it be an exposure to something? Could it be head trauma? Could it be uncontrolled diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol? These are all things that just synergize together to potentially make a late onset Alzheimer’s case start earlier.” —Richard Isaacson\nGenetic risk factors for early-onset Alzheimer’s disease\n\nGenes known to cause early-onset Alzheimer’s disease: Variations in the genes for presenilin-1, presenilin-2, and amyloid precursor protein gene mutation\n\nThese variations are quite rare (far less than 1% of people): \n\nRichard has only had a few patients (out of more than 1,500) that have had one of these variations\nPeter has never had a patient with one of them\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic and epigenetic causes pushing onset of AD earlier in life\nMost people that get AD earlier in life don’t have “early-onset Alzheimer’s disease” but rather they have a “milieu of things” aka polygenic risk and epigenetics that simply push the onset of AD earlier in life\n\nFor example, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene variants\n\nThe E4 variant raises AD risk\nIn contrast, the E2 variant is protective and the E3 variant, which is most common, is neutral\n\n\nLifestyle and behavioral characteristics\n\nDiet\nExercise\nHead trauma\nComorbidities (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol)\n\n\n\n“Genes are not our destiny. We can absolutely win the tug of war against our genes.” —Richard Isaacson\n<img decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14562\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fig-1-rogen-1024x504.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fig-1-rogen-1024x504.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fig-1-rogen-300x148.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fig-1-rogen-768x378.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fig-1-rogen.png 1406w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 1. Genetic influence on early and late Alzheimer’s disease risk. Image credit: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nThe future of Alzheimer’s disease prevention and treatment:\n\nAnd there are usually multiple genes involved, which is why Richard believes that the future of Alzheimer’s prevention will be based on precision medicine \nUsing these types of genetic underpinnings, understanding all the individual genes that impact a person’s risk, figuring out what they are, figuring out what their biological function is, figuring out why it puts a person down the path towards Alzheimer’s and then telling that person to do A, B, C, X, Y, and Z to get them off the path towards Alzheimer’s\n\nWhat is it about APOE4 that confers more risk for AD?\n\nApoE is involved in cholesterol transport\nThe ApoE4 variant is also a cardiovascular risk factor\nPeople with the ApoE4 variant typically accumulate more amyloid protein in their brains\nAccording to Richard, ApoE4 is understood well enough that it is not as much of a concern compared to the other contributing factors that we do not yet understand as well\n\n \nLauren’s mother’s disease progression and the enormous stress it causes for family members [24:30]\nLauren’s wedding\n\nWhen Lauren was planning her wedding, her mother had just turned 60—she was still able to walk and dress herself, but she need full time care and was not always aware of where she was or even that Lauren was her daughter\nLauren could not even have her mother around while getting ready for the wedding because she would wander off\nAt the rehearsal dinner, Lauren’s mother, being uncomfortable and in an unfamiliar setting told Lauren that she just wanted to go home–This was “really hard to handle” for Lauren\nAlthough Lauren never had the moment with her mother she had long expected, she is grateful for the extent that her mother was able to participate and recognize\nLauren describing the contrast of her mother’s behavior at the wedding versus the rehearsal dinner: “But then miraculously, the day of she walked in and she called me the bride and she knew that I was the bride and that I think she knew that I was her daughter. But she knew she felt proud. She knew she felt love. And I have an amazing photo of her looking at me and holding my hand. And it’s just, she knows that there’s a connection there …”\nIn regard to her mothering recognizing her, Lauren said: “Once that’s gone, that’s gone. But for whatever reason, the day of my actual wedding, I will say she was as there as anyone could be in her state.” \n\nStress on the family\n\nThe stress for the family caring for a family member with AD cannot be understanded\nLauren’s father was taking the brunt of the stress as the primary caretaker\nOn the plane back home from Lauren’s wedding, her mother was acting out and screaming and had an accident on the seat — her father described is as “the worst five hours of his life”\n\n \nThe various manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease depending on the location of pathology [29:30]\nHow the location of pathology influences disease outcome\n\nThe progression of Alzheimer’s is commonly represented by Braak staging, which describes how different changes in function and behavior occur as Alzheimer’s pathology spreads throughout the brain\nAlthough understanding of Alzheimer’s symptoms was once limited to just changes in short-term memory, it is now known that symptoms are much more diverse and related to which areas of the brain are affected by the pathology\n\n“Wherever the pathology goes, those are the symptoms that manifest.” —Richard Isaacson\n\nA few examples of different manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease:\n\nDysexecutive syndrome, which affects judgment and planning\nPrimary age-related tauopathy (PART) is more related to short-term memory\n\nBut this person could maintain their executive function\n\n\n\n\nDifferences in manifestation are mainly dictated by which regions of the brain are affected by the disease\nFor example, when someone has pathology in the back of the brain, where vision processing occurs, they may have difficulty interpreting images\nBased on this, Peter offers the analogy that like cancer, Alzheimer’s is more than just one disease\n\n \nThe three stages of Alzheimer’s disease [34:45]\nHow would Richard think about Lauren’s mom’s case based on what Lauren described?\n\nHer symptoms began with little repeating of stories, and memory glitches around 52 to 54 resulting in a modified work schedule\nSix years later, she’s having trouble caring for herself, maybe not recognizing her daughter, and then having emotional behavioral psychiatric components\nThat sounds like Alzheimer’s disease—progressive short-term memory loss, plus behavioral changes, plus other things\nShe started in the mild cognitive impairment phase with the symptoms (stage 2 of AD)\n\nThe three stages of Alzheimer’s disease:\nStage 1: Preclinical phase where Alzheimer’s disease has started in the brain, but there are no clinically apparent symptoms\n\nRichard says there could be up to 46 million Americans with Alzheimer’s disease in their brain right now, but no symptoms\nThis stage is by far the most important phase to focus on because that would be the time where you could intervene and try to prevent the dementia from happening \n\nStage 2: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s\n\nThere are enough memory glitches and other changes to where it’s noticeable, it’s greater than a standard deviation and a half below the norm, but the person can still take care of themselves\n\nStage 3: Dementia\n\nStudies suggest there’s a 12-16% per year of converting from MCI to dementia\nThe only difference bt MCI and dementia is that the same symptoms are just worse and they can no longer take care of themselves\n\n“Believe it or not, there are 46 million Americans with Alzheimer’s disease in their brain right now, but no symptoms.” —Richard Isaacson\n \nRichard’s deep exploration into Lauren’s family history revealing clues about a diagnosis and a roadmap to successful disease mitigation [39:15]\nLauren’s uncle’s battle with Alzheimer’s disease\n\nLauren’s mother’s brother, who was 5 years older than her mother, started showing symptoms in his mid-60s\nKnowing how destructive the disease was for her mother (who was already bedridden at this point),  Lauren sought out the best east coast physician and was recommended into Richard\n\nMeeting Richard becoming a patient \n\nShortly after connecting her uncle with Richard, Lauren wanted to visit the clinic and meet Richard\nDuring her visit, she ended up demanding to become a patient\nAs Richard recounts, Lauren shot her arm out and said “Take my blood now. Let’s do it.”\n\n\nFrom there, Richard’s ultimate goal was to understand as much as possible about the family history of AD and to try to uncover all the different risk factors\nKnowing this could not only potentially help Lauren’s uncle, but just as importantly help Richard figure out the best path to prevention for Lauren (and her brother)\n\nExploring family history — the “detective work” (Step 1)\n\nRichard was able to see signs of decline in both of Lauren’s grandparents based on changes in their handwriting and their choice of words in Lauren’s mother’s and uncle’s high-school yearbooks, which were five years apart\nBased on seeing video of Lauren’s mother earlier in her progression, Richard sensed something more than just Alzhiemer’s was going on – perhaps dementia with Lewy bodies, as seen in Parkinson’s disease and consistent with the observed handwriting changes in the yearbooks \nWord choice can also be telling — he mentions a study in nuns whose risk of dementia was predicted by autobiographies they wrote in their late teens, 60 years earlier\nCoincidentally, Lauren’s great uncle was a patient of Richard’s brother (which helped with understanding family history) \n\n“people with the APOE4 for variant, one or two copies, have smaller brains when they’re born. So, I know we say Alzheimer’s starts 20 to 30 years before in the brain. Well, that may be because of the biomarkers of Alzheimer’s that we can detect are noticeable then. But I believe Alzheimer’s is a life course disease.”  —Richard Isaacson\nRichard’s process with patients:\n\nInvestigative work (e.g., family history, signs of symptoms from various place — videos, handwriting, etc.)\nMedical history\nGenetic testing\n\n“We just try to put together lots of different pieces to the puzzle, and do as best as we can with the information we have to personalize, or individualize a person’s care.” —Richard Isaacson\nAt this point in the process, the main question Richard had was: Despite both having two copies of the ApoE4 variant, Lauren’s mom had AD symptoms much sooner than her uncle. Why?\n\nRisk of the ApoE4 variant is more pronounced in women, possibly related to menopause\nLauren’s mother had a hysterectomy, which may have been a contributing factor due to the loss of estrogen\nLifestyle factors:\n\nShe never exercised (uncle was an avid exerciser)\nShe ate a lot of sugar\nBad sleep habits (same with her uncle)\n\n\n\n \nHow exercise reduces Alzheimer’s disease risk, and the different risk between males and females [58:00]\n“The number one thing by far is exercise and physical activity.” —Richard Isaacson\nExercise\n\nRichard points out that our understanding of exercise physiology has improved a lot since the 1980s – for example, \n\nwe know that the target of 10,000 steps per day is antiquated \nand that it’s possible to have a potentially harmful amount of abdominal fat despite a normal BMI\n\n\nRichard considers high-intensity interval training to be the most important factor in Alzheimer’s prevention\nLauren reiterates that there was a big difference in physical activity between her mother and the rest of the family – Lauren, her brother, and her uncle were all athletes while her mother was more intellectual and preferred reading\n\n“High intensity interval training is probably the only thing that can move the needle in terms of certain aspects of cognitive function in people with the APOE4 variant.” —Richard Isaacson\nGender\n\nRichard was first inspired to better understand the greater Alzheimer’s risk among women after prodding from Maria Shriver \nPeter points out that women living longer has been proposed as the reason for greater Alzheimer’s risk, but that this does not explain all of the difference\n\nWhat Richard believes to be happening in women:\n\nPerimenopause is a “brain disease”\n\nDuring perimenopause there are metabolic shifts in the brain that can predispose to acceleration of Alzheimer’s pathology\nHe also believes that this is underappreciated and can be countered with appropriate use of estrogen replacement\nThe disruption of sleep, the brain fog, problems with processing speed and attention, are all symptoms of perimenopause\nPerimenopause transition is a huge unrealized risk factor for progression to dementia in an Alzheimer’s susceptible woman\nLauren’s mother’s hysterectomy was likely a contributing factor in her progression\n\n\n\n“If you want to fast forward brain aging in a woman . . .An E4/E4 woman, a surgical menopause, meaning taking out the ovaries with the uterus, wow, that could do it.” —Richard Isaacson\n\nOther factors contributing to risk in women:\n\nWidowhood:“widowhood is a astronomically important risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia” \nAbdominal obesity: women with an enlarged waist circumference have a 39% increase in dementia risk \nInterestingly, in men, muscle mass is a more important predictor than body fat, but we do not yet know why\nRichard is currently doing a study involving comprehensive brain imaging in men and women between the ages of 40-65 and will hopefully be able to determine the reason for this difference between men and women\n\n\n\n \nWhy knowing your APOE status is important, and whether certain people should be wearier of head trauma [1:08:00]\nThe ethics of testing\n\nLauren has one copy of ApoE4 and prefers knowing – she feels empowered knowing that she is doing what she can to offset the risk\nHer test revealed that she has E3/E4 (which is less risky that E4/E4)\nPeter has been criticized by at least one primary care physician for informing people of their ApoE status\n\nBut the criticism comes from the thinking that there’s nothing you can do to change your course (which isn’t true)\nA quick example, people with E4/E4 don’t absorb omega-3 fats from eating fatty fish very well, therefore they should be supplementing with omega-3 from an early age to protect the brain\n\n\nThe REVEAL study showed that disclosing ApoE4 status did not cause clinically significant anxiety or depression\nIn 2011, Richard co-authored a review on genetic risk factors for dementia that unfortunately did not draw much attention\n\nIn contrast, it is now common for papers to be exclusively focused on ApoE4\n\n\n\n“Science gives us tools. I don’t want to live in the dark and not use the few tools that I’ve been given at this point. That seems way worse to me.” —Lauren Miller Rogen on the knowing versus not knowing of one’s ApoE status\nHead trauma\n\nHead trauma may be more of a concern in individuals with the ApoE4 variant, which is additional justification for testing \nPeter believes knowing the child’s ApoE status would be an important factor in choosing to play contact sports like football\nRichard agrees that playing sports like football can impose increased risk in conjunction with being an ApoE4 carrier, but also acknowledges that it is a difficult topic – “These are really difficult conversations to have, but knowledge is power”\n\n \nHow Richard uses genetic testing to personalize care [1:14:45]\n“One day, I hope it’s soon, we’re going to know all these genes and when they get their preventative health screenings, it’s not just E4, we’re going to get a whole bunch of genes. And primary care doctors. . .are going to basically do these genetic screens on multiple genes and give people targeted personalized plans for disease risk reduction as early as possible.” —Richard Isaacson\nThe polygenic nature of genetic risk factors\n\nThere are about 30 genes that are known to influence Alzheimer’s risk and Richard thinks are important\nThis is a complicated topic because risk is influenced by the combination of gene variants\nFor example, Richard considers TOMM40 to be an important gene, and its influence can vary depending on ApoE4 status\n\nTaking a step back: “Alzheimer’s is a medical condition.”\n\nWhether you’re on the lipid path, the inflammation path, or the potentially infectious path, or the head trauma path…\nThere’s so many different things that can trigger brain related pathology\n\nOther genes Richard looks at:\n\nVascular genes like FTO and other genes related to lipid metabolism like PCSK9\nHe also pays attention to longevity genes such as those related to FOXOs and Klotho\nThe gene for TNF-α, an inflammatory cytokine, is another factor that can modulate the risk associated with the ApoE4 variant\n\nLauren has a variant of the gene for TNF-α that increases her risk, and Richard and Peter have adjusted her protocol accordingly \nLaren’s mother also had this TNF-α variant, but her uncle did not\n\n\nPeter appropriately sums this topic up by saying that “not all E4s are created equal,” similar to lipoprotein(a) and cardiovascular risk\n\n \nThe “ABCs” of Alzheimer’s prevention, lifestyle interventions, and Lauren’s personal protocol for reducing her risk [1:21:45]\nLauren’s journey:\n\nAbout 2 years ago (2018), Lauren really started to focus on preventing and/or delaying AD in herself\nFortunately, her husband (Seth Rogen) is very supportive of her efforts and her has changed his habits\n\n“When you see what I have seen over the last 15 years, why wouldn’t I do anything I possibly can to avoid what I saw over the last 15 years?

Image credit: sciencedirect.com\nLauren’s protocol\n\nExercise: Because of Lauren’s ApoE4 status, exercise – particularly high-intensity interval training – is emphasized in her protocol\nOmega-3 fats (EPA and DHA): \n\nHer E4 status make this more important—A study involving 2 g of DHA supplementation showed that less of it gets to the cerebral spinal fluid of people with the ApoE4 variant\nLauren takes ~2,000 mg of DHA \nRichard aims for his patients to have an omega-3 index of at least 12-14 (based on red blood cell level) \n\nHere’s an at home test to measure your omega-3 index: OmegaQuant \n\n\n\n\nLowering inflammation: Because of her TNF-α variant, she is on a purified form of cocoa flavanols and a nanoparticle version of curcumin (Theracurmin)\n\nA study has shown Theracurmin to improve cognitive function and decrease amyloid accumulation in healthy adults\n\n\nLowering homocysteine: Lauren takes a B-vitamin complex (which has B12, B6, and folic acid, etc.) to address her homocysteine levels\n\nHigh homocysteine is associated with increased brain atrophy resulting in impaired memory function\nThe B-complex combined with sufficient levels of Omega-3s can slow brain shrinkage, brain atrophy, and improve memory\n\n\nOptimizing Vitamin D:\n\nSupplementation was also emphasized in Lauren’s protocol because her blood concentration was low (less than 20 ng/mL)\nRichard says based on a study in the European Journal of Nutrition, people with ApoE4/4 “better have good vitamin D levels… at 50 or more”\nRichard believes that an optimal vitamin D level is somewhere around 40-50 ng/mL\n*Tips for getting more vitamin D:\n\nConsuming supplements with fat since vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin\nGetting 10-15 minutes of sun exposure between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about magnesium supplementation?\n\nPeter is a big fan of magnesium L-threonate (Magtein) because the L-threonate helps the magnesium enter the brain more easily\n\nA small study has shown magnesium L-threonate to improve cognitive function in people with mild to moderate dementia\nRichard has traditionally favored magnesium glycinate based on its use for headaches and it being well tolerated, but he is intrigued by magnesium L-threonate\nRichard also believes that magnesium L-threonate may help with sleep, which he has found helpful for “stressed out type A people”\n\n\n\n \nUnique treatment for people with the ApoE4 variant [1:36:30]\nHow ApoE4 influences risk and prevention\n\nRichard’s team published a review in 2018 specifically describing the role of ApoE4 in guiding clinical prevention\nThe justification for this paper, as Richard points out, is that the influence of ApoE4 on Alzheimer’s risk is complicated, as described below\nBeing an ApoE4 carrier exacerbates the negative effects of being sedentary\nTobacco use has more of a negative effect in ApoE4 carriers\nAlthough the data is confusing, ApoE4 carriers should maybe be more conservative with alcohol consumption, with there potentially being benefit from completely abstaining\nCognitive engagement may be more important for ApoE4 carriers, but the data is unclear here as well\nAs already mentioned, ApoE4 carriers need higher doses of omega-3 fatty acids\nA trial is underway to determine the influence of saturated fat and a high-glycemic diet on ApoE4 carriers\nRichard is also in favor of using medium-chain triglycerides, but he’s more liberal with them for people WITHOUT an E4 variant — “a tricky topic worthy of a separate discussion”\n\n“Brain imaging studies show that E4 carriers exacerbates the effect of having a sedentary lifestyle in Alzheimer’s pathology. So, someone with E4 really, really, better exercise. It’s no joke, it’s got to be really important and the intensity of the exercise is key.” —Richard Isaacson\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14564\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fig-3-rogen-1024x832.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"832\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fig-3-rogen-1024x832.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fig-3-rogen-300x244.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fig-3-rogen-768x624.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fig-3-rogen.png 1362w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 3.

Image credit: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n \nRichard’s mixed opinion on CBD and THC as a tool for disease prevention [1:40:00]\nWhy a precision medicine approach applies to CBD and THC\n\nRichard is open minded to CBD and THC, but considers this a difficult topic\nHe thinks the benefit is dependent on the ratio of CBD to THC\nHe also thinks consuming it in edible form makes more sense than smoking it\nEvidence in regard to helping versus accelerating Alzheimer’s pathology is mixed\nBased on this Richard is “not anti-CBD,” but is “not pro” THC (he says he’s “in the middle”)\nRichard thinks the answer to CBD and THC is one rooted in precision medicine – it depends on the patient, and the situation should be objectively measured by tracking things like sleep and cognitive function\n\n \nCognitive testing procedures, and how Lauren’s tests furthered her commitment to her disease prevention protocol [1:41:45]\nCognitive testing in Richard’s clinic\n\nRichard uses a modified form of the Alzheimer’s prevention cognitive composite (validated in this study), which is largely based on the NIH Toolbox of cognitive assessments \nThe testing he uses is sensitive enough to detect changes in brain function before symptoms occur\nTesting is not perfect because people have good days and bad days\n\nFor example, processing speed and attention can be negatively affected by a bad night of sleep\nLauren feels as if there may have been a “practice effect,” in which she became better at the tests simply by doing them, which is a concern with testing in general, but ApoE4 carriers are interestingly less susceptible to this\n\n\nBut Richard says he can look for specific things that can indicate a confounder \nRichard clearly believes in the usefulness of the cognitive testing\n\nHow testing changed Lauren’s commitment to her protocol\n\nAs Lauren put it, she only “half started” in the beginning, exercising and slightly improving her diet, but not doing everything she needed to\nOn one of Lauren’s visits to Richard’s clinic following a stressful period in her life, she did poorly on the cognitive testing, indicating that her lifestyle at that point was pushing her in the wrong direction\nAfter Richard expressed serious concern, Lauren committed to putting in more effort, and it was at about this point that she also started working with Peter\n\nResults so far for Lauren:\n\nWhen Lauren first saw Richard, her cognitive performance was below average, but now it is more than a standard deviation above average\nDespite possible confounders, Richard says unequivocally her brain is functioning better than it was before she really took her Alzheimer’s disease prevention protocol seriously \n\n“Your brain and biomarkers, your blood based biomarkers, you’re optimized. You’re different. Your brain is firing on more cylinders.” —Richard Isaacson on how Lauren’s brain function has changed since she implemented the Alzheimer’s disease prevention protocol\n \nThe relevance of sense of smell and hearing in Alzheimer’s disease risk and prevention [1:50:00]\nSmell\n\nLoss of smell and inability to identify certain smells were originally viewed as warning signs for Parkinson’s disease, but as Richard puts it, this can and also be “a harbinger of Alzheimer’s disease”\nConsistent with this, Lauren’s mother never had a good sense of smell\nRichard uses smell sensitivity as part of his testing battery, but loss of smell being a common symptom of COVID-19 (which Richard had a pretty bad case of himself) may interfere with this testing\n\nHearing\n\nHearing loss is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease\nIn the 2020 report of the Lancet Commission, hearing loss was identified as one of the strongest modifiable risk factors for dementia — one’s reaction to the study could be that “a huge number of cases of dementia could be potentially reduced if a person gets early recognition of hearing impairment and gets it addressed.”\nThe reason why is not clearly known, but Richard speculates that it may be related to disengaging — “You can’t hear, you’re in your own little world, you miss social cues, you have different interaction levels. I actually don’t know the answer to this, and the classic line, we need more research to truly be able to figure this out.”\nRichard feels that screening for hearing, perhaps at a certain age, should be included in medical evaluations\n\n \nThe emotional benefit of knowing you have control over your mental and physical health [1:57:30]\n“I see my blood work. I see numbers going from red to green. And that gives me a hope that I think translates into my physical being, but also into my cognitive health as well.” —Lauren Miller Rogen\nWhile Richard has objective data that says Lauren is improving her risk factors for AD, he wants to know how she feels physically, mentally, and emotionally\nPhysically,\n\n“Physically, I feel better.”\nMy overall health is better— “From a total body energy, the way I can approach a situation, I feel like I have a different type of body energy.”\n\nCognitively, \n\n“I fortunately feel like someone who is pretty in control of their cognition most of the time.”\nBut she can’t say for sure she feels definitively different than before \n\nEmotionally, \n\nGoing back to 10 years, Lauren felt some depression around the idea that AD was inevitable \nBut after working with Richard, she now feels like there’s no reason to believe you’re going to get Alzheimer’s disease, no matter your genetics\nShe says that the fear has dissipated because “I have control in a way that I didn’t before”\n\n“Maybe that’s the greatest single benefit of all.” —Lauren Miller Rogen on the emotional benefit of taking control of your health and understanding that genetics don’t seal your fate \n \nHFC—a charitable organization founded by Lauren and Seth [2:00:15]\nAbout Hilarity for Charity \n\nHilarity for Charity (HFC) is a charitable organization founded by Lauren and her husband Seth Rogen (a comedian)\nLauryn says: “… I have been so fortunate in my terrible journey. I think I’ve had the best situation of a horror show that could happen with Alzheimer’s in that, one, my family was able to afford care for my mom, and that, two, because of my relationships and the advocate that I’ve become, I have met smart people like you guys who have helped me take control of my brain health.”\nPart of the intent of HFC is to help others have a similarly less terrible situation\nHFC is focused on Alzheimer’s disease and has two primary intentions: to help people (and their caregivers) who need help now, and to help people minimize future risk\n\nHFC sends caregivers to people’s homes to give the primary caregiver a break\nThey also have a partnership with the Rosalynn Carter Institute for training these caregivers\n\n\nHFC also encourages young people to share their stories and start taking care of their brains \nHFC funds research, but to date they have not raised enough money to fund major studies\nWhen Lauren went to a support group early on in her mother’s progression, she was a 26-year-old surrounded by, for example, a guy who was 56 and upset about his mother\nBased on this experience, Lauren has made it a mission of HFC to help connect people to others who can understand their situation\nCOVID-19 has slowed fundraising for HFC, but as Lauren points out, while people and organizations are diverting their donations to COVID-related efforts, as they should be, we all still have brains\n\nIn addition, COVID-19 is making life for caregivers more difficult\n\n\nHFC also welcomes people to have their own fundraising events on behalf of HFC\nFor example, one person drove a tuk-tuk across India as a fundraiser\n\n“I think overall, we’re just trying to provide people the hope that I have found over the years. We started this podcast talking about my dark devastating times and that’s not who I am anymore, and that’s not my vision about all of this anymore. And I think there is so much control that can be had that we did not have even just a few years ago. And we through HFC are just trying to teach people that they have that control too.” —Lauren Miller Rogen\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialThe previous Drive episode featuring Richard: #18 – Richard Isaacson, M.D.: Alzheimer’s prevention | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [0:45]\nThe Drive episodes featuring Tom Dayspring | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [4:00]\n\n#20 – Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part I of V: an introduction to lipidology\n#21 – Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part II of V: Lipid metrics, lipid measurements, and cholesterol regulation\n#22 – Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part III of V: HDL, reverse cholesterol transport, CETP inhibitors, and apolipoproteins\n#23 – Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part IV of V: statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, niacin, cholesterol and the brain\n#24 – Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part V of V: Lp(a), inflammation, oxLDL, remnants, and more\n#129 – Tom Dayspring, M.D.: The latest insights into cardiovascular disease and lipidology\n\nA study in nuns showing autobiographies written in their late teens to be predictive of dementia risk 60 years later: Language decline across the life span: findings from the Nun Study (Kemper et al., 2001) [49:45]\nA meta-analysis showing increased risk of dementia among widowed people: Marriage and risk of dementia: systemic review and meta-analysis of observational studies (Sommerlad et al., 2018) [1:05:45]\nWomen with an enlarged waist circumference have a 39% increase in dementia risk: Higher risk of dementia in English older individuals who are overweight or obese (Ma et al., 2020) [1:06:15]\nThe REVEAL study, which showed that disclosing ApoE4 status did not cause clinically significant depression or anxiety: Disclosing genetic risk for Alzheimer’s dementia to individuals with mild cognitive impairment (Christensen et al., 2020) [1:14:15]\nA review describing the potential benefit of omega-3 fatty acids in decreasing dementia risk potentially among ApoE4 carriers: The ApoE ε4 isoform: can the risk of diseases be reduced by environmental factors?
