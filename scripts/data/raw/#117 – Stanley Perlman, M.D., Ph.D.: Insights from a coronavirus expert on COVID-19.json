  "content": "In this episode Stanley Perlman shares insights from his impressive career studying coronaviruses–both the common and more deadly ones, like MERS and SARS. In comparing preceding coronaviruses with SARS-CoV-2, Stanley discusses how other coronaviruses can aid our current understanding of, and be used to infer about, COVID-19. He also gives his thoughts on durable immunity, therapeutic strategies, and future outbreak preparedness.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#117 - Stanley Perlman, M.D., Ph.D.: Insights from a coronavirus expert on COVID-19\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#117 - Stanley Perlman, M.D., Ph.D.: Insights from a coronavirus expert on COVID-19\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#117 - Stanley Perlman, M.D., Ph.D.: Insights from a coronavirus expert on COVID-19\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nHis background and early work with coronaviruses [2:45];\nCoronavirus family—various types, common traits, and scientific understanding [9:00];\nThe origin of viruses, animal to human transmission, R_0, immunity, and more [17:45];\nInsights from the 2002 SARS outbreak [28:30];\nInsights from the 2012 MERS outbreak [35:00];\nComparing SARS-CoV-2 to MERS, SARS, and other coronaviruses [42:00];\nCOVID-19 survivor potential for long-term damage [53:30];\nUsing the current pandemic for lessons on future preparedness [57:00];\nGenetic drift and the potential for long-term immunity to COVID-19 [1:07:00];\nPrevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19 and future diseases [1:22:30];\nAlternative hypothesis to the origin of SARS-CoV-2 [1:32:30];\nDetermining durable immunity to COVID-19 and what a successful vaccine looks like [1:34:30];

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations? [35:00]; What makes the human brain different than all other species? [44:15]; Imprinting stress to your kids epigenetically [48:00]; The role of stress on memory and the consequences of hypercortisolemia [53:00]; The impact of subjective socioeconomic status and social media on stress levels and health [57:45]; Tips for managing stress in the modern world [1:13:15]; What Robert learned about himself studying the social behavior of baboons [1:25:30]; The multilayered factors behind every human behavior, the context of “good and bad”, and exploring the human capacity of the wild extremes of violence and altruism from moment to moment [1:30:15]; PMS: How two women with identical hormone levels can have completely different emotional experiences [1:34:45]; How much of a role do genes play in depression and other emotional states? [1:38:00]; Why is cortisol elevated under sleep deprivation?

The “corona”of coronavirus. Image credit: nature.com\nWhen did these coronaviruses show up as a common cold?\n\nThe first coronavirus was observed in the 1930s and 40s from chicken (infectious bronchitis virus)\nIn the 1960s, people identified viruses that caused the common cold that had the same appearance as the infectious bronchitis virus\nIt was isolated from people with colds and it had the same structure as coronaviruses in chickens and pigs so that’s how they knew it was in the coronavirus family\n\n \nThe origin of viruses, animal to human transmission, R_0, immunity, and more [17:45] \nIs it the exception or the rule that a virus that infects humans also has an animal host?\n\nHard to say because there are examples of both\nMeasles and smallpox only infect humans (And that’s why we can eliminate them from human populations)\nMost coronaviruses can infect people and animals (making them hard to eradicate)\n\nSARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, can infect animals (So humans can infect animals)\nSARS-CoV-1 certainly infected other animals\nMERS is really a camel virus, so by definition affects other animals\nCommon cold coronaviruses are mostly just humans with the exception of at least one which can infect other animals\n\n\n\n*The takeaway: When virus can go from animals to humans and vice versa, it gives the virus a survival advantage\n\nExample, West Nile virus keeps popping up even though we have an effective vaccine because the virus remains in birds and other animals\n\nViruses with a high R_0\n\nOther viruses can survive in humans simply because it spreads so easily\nMeasles, for example…\n\nThere is a large herd immunity to measles\nBut it keeps popping up every few years because the R_0 is so high that it can manage to find any susceptible people\n\n\nWhereas influenza…It has an R_0 that is just an order of magnitude lower\n\nWhere did human viruses come from if they never had an animal host?\n\nThey all probably did initially have an animal host\nMeasles is thought to evolve from rinderpest which affects animals in Africa\nWhile a virus may start in an animal, it may evolve to be suited for humans and be unable to go back to animals (rendering it a “human only” virus thereafter)\n\nSo with SARS-CoV-2, we don’t really know if a bat could be infected by it because it may have changed enough even in the little bit of time it’s been out of the bat\n\n\nHIV example…\n\nWe have a very strong sense that HIV came from nonhuman primates\nBut now it’s a human virus\n\n\n\nStanley’s work with coronavirus in the 1990s \nLate 1990s…\n\nOnly two known coronaviruses which were HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43\n\nThese viruses manifested as common colds\n\n\nSARS-Cov-1 emerged in 2002-2004\nThen 2 more coronaviruses, HCoV NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered after SARS-CoV-1 \nIn the 90s, however, coronaviruses weren’t on many people’s radar because “They don’t make people that sick. Who cares?“\n\nTakeaway that is relevant to COVID-19…\n\nThe people who got these common cold coronaviruses could be reinfected\nSo it could be that if you have a mild infection, you may have a more transient immune response\n\n⇒ To learn more about the immune response to viruses, please check out Peter’s discussion with David Watkins\n\nDavid explains the difference between the innate immune system & the adaptive immune system \nAnd the two branches of the adaptive immune system:\n\ni) The humeral system, which relies on B cells and their antibodies, \nii) And the cellular system which relies on T cells \n\n\n\nWhy did Stanley study coronavirus so extensively in the 1990s when it wasn’t a big problem for humans?\nMouse virus and multiple sclerosis \n\nHe was interested mostly in a mouse virus and the human disease, multiple sclerosis\nThe questions were: \n\nHow does a virus go into the brain, end up in the cells that make myelin, and how does the virus end up there? \nHow come the immune response can’t figure out how to rid the cells of the virus without also destroying the cells themselves, and destroying the function of their cells?\nFor those people that actually get better, how is that occurring?\n\n\nUltimately, Stanley was trying to determine: How does a virus that’s infecting the brain get cleared? Why does clearance always involve tissue destruction?\n\n \nInsights from the 2002 SARS outbreak [28:30]\nSARS-CoV-1 (virus that causes SARS)\n\nEmerged in 2002, became a big deal in 2003, and was mostly eliminated by July 2003\nStanley heard about this virus that was causing a respiratory disease in southern China\nInitially thought this was going to be a kind of flu virus because flu viruses we know initiate often in southern China, particularly in the city of Guangzhou, which is across the bay from Hong Kong\nIt then became clear that it was a coronavirus\n\n-How it spread\n\nIt came from a live animal market in Guangzhou, a “wet market”\nThe SARS coronavirus was almost certainly a bat virus that spread to other animals including the human handlers\nMany of those handlers became sick and developed subclinical disease\nUp to a third of the handlers actually had antibodies to SARS-CoV\nIn some cases, it would spread to mainland China and sort of stay there\nBut in one case…\n\nA single animal handler became ill enough to see a physician\nThat physician then became quite ill while at a Hong Kong hotel and spread the virus to the other people in the hotel\nThose people returned to their homes and that’s how the virus ended up spreading around the world\n\n\n\nR_0 of SARS\n\nThe R_0 was about 2-3\n\nFor context, measles has an R_0 of about 15\nCommon cold coronaviruses have an R_0 of about 1 on the average\n\n\nHowever, the R_0 of 2-3 may be “misleading” says Stanley\n\nBecause SARS spread much more readily inside a hospital \nSARS was a virus that really caused pneumonia and when in a hospital the virus was released into the air by procedures (intubation or suctioning), then the R_0 factor would be much more than 2-3\nWithin the community, it really isn’t that contagious\nSo if you were to split up those 8,000 cases, the avg. would be 2-3 with quite a range depending on when the virus was acquired\n\n\n\nCFR and IFR of SARS\n\nSARS gets widely quoted as having a 10% mortality rate (aka CFR)\nHowever, we don’t know the true total number of cases\nSo case fatality rate may be 10%\nBut the infection fatality rate is what really matters which is likely much lower given a unknown number of people probably didn’t have a severe enough version that they warranted hospitalization or testing\nMERS is much more deadly with a case fatality rate of about 35% (unknown IFR)\n\n \nInsights from the 2012 MERS outbreak [35:00]\nMERS-CoV (virus that causes Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus aka MERS)\n\nMERS is similar to SARS in that it’s a deep lung disease\nThe mortality (CFR) is estimated to be 35%\n\nDifference bt SARS and MERS\n\nSARS-1 and SARS-2 are in the same beta family\nMERS is a slightly different subdivision of the coronavirus family\nThey’re all in the same general group of coronaviruses and within the same subgroup of coronaviruses\nBUT, they’re slightly different in their genome organization and in some of their coding so they’re put into a separate category. \nSo your immune system is less likely to protect you from MERS even if you’ve had SARS (however, MERS coronavirus is recognized in part by SARS coronavirus serum from people who survive)\nIt’s like your third cousin instead of your first cousin\n\nWhen did MERS appear?\n\nMERS in camels probably came along  in 1983\nMERS in people was found in 2012\n\nMysteries about MERS coronavirus:\n\nIt’s only in people in the Arabian Peninsula even though camels in Africa also have MERS (it just doesn’t jump to people)\nAlso, in camels these coronaviruses caused the common cold while in people it was deadly\nWe still don’t know WHY it’s jumping from camels to people\nIt’s occurring once or twice a week now where people are coming to the hospital with MERS (they often have comorbidities/diabetes)\nBut it’s unclear HOW they are getting it because many times these people have no contact with camels\n\nCan MERS spread human to human? What is the R_0?\n\nOfficial R_0 for MERS is somewhere between 0-4 (very broad because it’s dependent on the setting)\nOutside of hospitals… the R_0 probably near to 0.3-0.5 (not impossible to spread from person to person, but it’s a small likelihood)\nInside a hospital… This is where human to human transmission is most likely to occur\nMERS killed roughly one third of the people that were infected\n\n~900 deaths out of ~2,500 confirmed cases\n\n\n\nHow it’s transmitted\n\nLike SARS, it’s mostly transmitted from people who have severe lung disease\nNosocomial spread (hospital spread), is a big problem because it’s quite rare so hospital staff doesn’t take the proper precautions every time a person with respiratory distress shows up\nWhen you put a breathing tube in somebody, you’re really creating an effective portal for the virus to get to you\nAnd then obviously we know how infections like that can spread through intensive care units and such.\n\n \nComparing SARS-CoV-2 to MERS, SARS, and other coronaviruses [42:00]\nWhy didn’t MERS turn into an epidemic, much less a pandemic?\n\nThe R_0 of 0.3 (outside a hospital) really makes it very unlikely\n\nHow did we eradicate SARS-CoV-1?\n\nThe combination of \n\ni) there being no reservoir (i.e., no camels that can be transmitted to humans)\nii) the fact that because you weren’t contagious until you were sick\n\n\nClassic case of identification plus quarantining\n\nPossibility of being lulled into a false sense of security with SARS-CoV-2\n\nWith SARS-1, it’s feasible to identify and quarantine with only 8,000 cases around the world (especially when you must have severe symptoms to spread the virus)\nPeter is concerned we could be lulled into a false sense of confidence\nTo date, most coronaviruses cause a bunch of colds\nThen a couple bad actors showed up (SARS and MERS) that can really hurt their host, but they’re nothing to really be afraid of because:\n\ni) It can’t bounce back and forth between humans and animals\nii) You’re very unlikely to spread it if you’re not symptomatic\niii) you can just isolate people when they’re sick and treat them before they treat others\n\n\n*None of this is true with SARS-2/COVID-19 \n\nIs it possible that a future coronavirus could come along that’s as lethal as MERS and can spread as easily as SARS-CoV-2?\n\n“I don’t think there’s anything that’s unlikely.” says Stanley\n“SARS-CoV-2 is like a mixture of the common cold coronavirus, and then plus either SARS or MERS coronavirus in the lungs.”\n\nWhat did SARS-1 and MERS do in the lungs to make it so lethal?\n\nIt’s the same thing that SARS-CoV-2 does in the lungs in those people who get severe disease.\nWe think that there’s two main features:\n\ni) there’s lots of virus in the lungs, and \nii) there’s a very strong and probably inappropriate immune response that’s causing much of the damage that we see in lungs.\n\n\n\nHow do SARS-1 and MERS enter the pneumocyte compared to SARS-CoV-2?\n\nSARS uses the ACE2 receptor just like SARS-CoV-2\nMERS uses at different receptor\n\nInfecting the upper and lower respiratory airway\n\nSARS-CoV-2 infects both the upper and lower airway\nSARS-1 does NOT affect the upper airway (That’s why it was not so contagious because it stayed in the deep lungs until you went to the hospital and had that tube put down for breathing or some other procedure done)\nOne of the common cold coronaviruses, NL63, uses the ACE2 receptor but only infects the upper airway and doesn’t affect the lungs (making it not deadly)\nThe upper airway infection of SARS-CoV-2 could account for the high transmissibility of COVID-19 and the lower airway infection increases its lethality\n\nComparing mortality rate of SARS, MERS, vs. SARS-CoV-2 \n\nStanley suggests that SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 all have similar mortality rates of those infected people who come down with pneumonia\nBut SARS-CoV-2 has a much lower infection fatality rate in large part because a majority of infections end up being asymptomatic, subclinical, have a cold, have something in the upper respiratory tract\n\n \nCOVID-19 survivor potential for long-term damage [53:30]\nFor a person who gets infected and has symptoms but survives…\nWhat do we know about long-term lung function?\n\nStanley says we don’t know much about this\nHe suspects people had residual problems which could be a few months or it could be forever\nFor MERS, Stanley couldn’t get much information out of Saudia Arabia on this topic ⇒ “I don’t know how much fibrosis was at the end of it all or how much permanent damage there was.”\n\nLong term neurological issues?\n\nSome people connect SARS to neurological disease without actually ever finding the virus in the brain\nMuch of the neurological issues have been attributed to being on ventilators and corticosteroids for long periods of time\nIs a plausible scenario by which the virus could cause residual neurologic issues?\nWe can’t find any evidence of the virus in the brain and it seems less likely that it’s direct virus infection.\n\n \nUsing the current pandemic for lessons on future preparedness [57:00]\nWhy didn’t more people think CV could be a pandemic in the future?\nPeter asks if Stanley had any idea that a coronavirus could become a pandemic level situation\n\nStanley admits he didn’t necessarily predict such an event\nThere were people thinking about this\nThe DOD in 2010/2011 put out a a report about possible emerging viruses as being a major threat and coronaviruses were on that list\nBill Gates predicted an event like this in his 2015 TED Talk\n\nWhen did Stanley first hear about the COVID-19 outbreak in China? \n\nLate December, which is when the first official cases were reported\nStanley thinks there may have been some in November\nAt that time, we didn’t really know how much human to human transmission was happening\nGiven the number of cases, we SHOULD have guessed that something unusual is going on\nBut by early January or mid-January, we had 800 cases in the world, “so it didn’t seem to be extraordinarily different from these other viruses” \nHad there been more information about what was going on in Wuhan, Stanley says that we would have known that something different than SARS-1 and MERS was going on \n\nWhen did it become clear to Stanley that this was going to be a much bigger problem than SARS and MERS?\n\nAfter speaking to his friends in China in late December he had a gut feeling that this was a big deal\nBut he never felt like it was going to be THIS big of a problem\n\nWhy? ⇒ Mostly because all the previous diseases had remained geographically confined (SARS stayed mostly in China, MERS was really a disease in the Arabian Peninsula)\nOf course, SARS-CoV-2 ended up being more transmissible and the people of Wuhan travel more frequently all leading to the major spread\n\n\n\nExamples of viruses that were less disastrous than people predicted (potentially contributing to the lack of alarm that people had when they heard about SARS-CoV-2):\n\nH5N1 swine flu\n\nIn the late 90s, the H5N1 swine flu was looked at as a potential disaster\nBut it never became transmissible human to human so it never became a problem\n\n\nH1N1 of 2009\n\nIdentified in Mexico, it seemed to have a high lethality\nAs more cases were identified it became clear it just was TONS of cases and very little mortality\n\n\n\nPreparing for a future pandemic\n\nWith coronavirus, there was certainly some thought that it could emerge to be a disaster\nBut it’s not as easy as simply saying it’s possible and therefore you have the resources to get what you need to be prepared\n\nI. e., “How do you decide what kind of resources you’re going to put to developing antivirals, developing vaccines against SARS, the disease that doesn’t exist anymore?” \n\n\nGood ideas can get funding from the NIH\nHowever, you’re competing against other grants that make more compelling arguments for funding and deal with diseases that are actually present\n“You have to figure out a way to identify a disease that could be a problem without going overboard and using lots of resources for diseases that never will be a problem.”\n\n-Peter’s take (on the topic of preparedness):\n–There are some generic things we would need on hand…\n\nNational stockpile of PPE\nElectronic infrastructure for contact tracing\nNational stash of nasal swabs and reagents to develop serologic and PCR testing\n\nThat way, the moment we know the gene sequence of a virus, we could actually deliver a million tests a day without a big delay\n\n\nOn the therapeutic side…a huge stockpile of immune modulating drugs since many of these diseases have an enormous component of an overactive immune response \n\n-Why is this so important?\n\nA few billion dollars investment into this is “not a staggering investment when you consider what we spend on healthcare and defense” says Peter\nIt’s also a smart way to hedge against the economy getting shut down again \n\n \nGenetic drift and the potential for long-term immunity to COVID-19 [1:07:00]\nCommon cold coronaviruses\n\nHCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43,  HCoV NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 \nThey tend to be more prevalent in the winter or early spring\nThese viruses are usually happier when it’s a little cooler and a little drier\n\n-Why don’t we develop long-term immunity to common colds? \n\nThere is an antibody response to these viruses but it seems to wane after a year and and go away after a couple years\nYou need a specific kind of antibody, the IgA response, but they seem to wane as well\nThe T-cell response for common cold coronaviruses is minimal because common colds usually go away in a few days before you actually have a T-cell response\nOpposite example would be smallpox—if you had smallpox in 1918, you’d still have strong antibody responses in 1995\nWith SARS-CoV-2, understanding this immune response/antibody process is critical to understand the ability of people to be reinfected, the response to vaccines, and the concept of herd immunity as we try to get rid of this virus—”So really important but not known.”\n\nExplaining herd immunity for SARS-2\n\nHerd immunity refers to what percentage of the population needs to be immune to a virus in order for the virus to not be able to spread\nThe higher the R_0 of a virus, the higher the percentage of the population needs to be immune (although, it doesn’t increase linearly)\nFor measles, which has a high R_0, you need about 95% of the population to be immune to reach herd immunity\nFor most common viruses, herd immunity is thought to be 60% or 70%\nFor SARS CoV-2, Stanley believes it’s probably in the 60-70% range (although some think it may be lower)\n\nHow much did these coronaviruses genetically drift?\n\nThe common flu has enough genetic drift every year that it requires a yearly vaccine\nSo needing a yearly vaccine is less about your immune system “forgetting” and more about the change of the flu strain year to year\nIn fact, most coronavirus, including SARS and MERS, and the current SARS-2, don’t change much (exception being OC43 which seems to have different variants)\nAnd for SARS-CoV-2… there’s no evidence so far that says this virus has changed in a way that makes it unlikely a vaccine will work, unlikely that a previous infection will protect you from a second infection\nThere may be reasons why it won’t, but it won’t be because the virus is changing\n\n“There’s really no evidence so far that says this virus has changed in a way that makes it unlikely a vaccine will work, unlikely that a previous infection will protect you from a second infection–there may be reasons why it won’t, but it won’t be because the virus is changing.”\n*Important point to reiterate:\n\nThe doomsday scenario would be if the virus had enough genetic drift that your immune system never recognizes it again AND it retains its lethality despite the drift\nHowever, the good news is that we don’t have evidence of either of those things happening\n\nWhat can we learn about immunity from studying other coronaviruses?\n⇒ See episode with David Watkins\n\nWhen you have a mild infection, you do not develop great immunity\n\nFor example, with common coronaviruses, they might not even stick around long enough to develop a T-cell response\n\n\nIn terms of antibodies…\n\nSix months after a person has a common coronavirus, we do see evidence of IgG antibodies\nHowever, they are not necessarily binding and/or neutralizing antibodies\nHuman studies for the common cold coronaviruses suggests that neutralizing antibodies are present following infection but it wanes with time and a year later it may not prevent reinfection\n\n\nStanley’s intuition is that with COVID-19, we will see the same thing for asymptomatic people or people who have mild infections, that they will be susceptible to reinfection a year later\n\n2020 paper in Cell\n\n20 patients who had recovered from COVID-19\nRoughly 2/3 of them actually had a CD8 T-cell response and a correlated CD4 response\nImplication being that they looked to have been at least partially aided in their response to SARS CoV-2 from T-cells that looked like they had been sensitized by other coronaviruses\n\n–Stanley brings up some important caveats:\n\nMost of these papers are measuring the activation of T-cell responses but not necessarily their functionality\nAlso, the targets for the T-cell response is not the usual response that you get in terms of targets like you see after the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection\nStanley does admit that the findings are “really interesting” \nAlthough, the findings actually go against what he has seen in MERS patients where we don’t see much evidence of cross-reactivity\n\n \nPrevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19 and future diseases [1:22:30]\nDo you think there are other viruses or other vaccines that could provide cross-reactivity?\n\nIn terms of specifically getting at the coronavirus, “I don’t think so” says Stanley\nThere are some ideas that you should immunize everybody with a vaccine for another virus in order to boost the immune system\n\nExamples:\n\nThe BCG vaccine for tuberculosis (And there are clinical trials testing this idea)\nThe MMR vaccine for measles is also being looked at\n\n\n\n\nStanley does not see any reason to believe that your memory T-cells and B-cells to measles, mumps and/or rubella would offer any some protection against this particular coronavirus\n\n-The takeaway:\n\nA boosted immune system from BCG, MMR, or agents that turn on interferon might be helpful if you got that vaccine within days before you were exposed to COVID-19\n“But I wouldn’t want to be given BCG just for fun with the possibility that in the next two days I get exposed to the virus.”\n\nTherapeutic preparations for a future pandemic\n\nWe need to be more thoughtful about thinking through ways to prevent/treat this virus\nWe should stop the binary thinking such as, “Is this drug good or bad?” \nWe need a more targeted therapeutic approach\nSo with COVID-19, that might look like:\n\nEarly treatment with an antiviral with an immune amplifier\nLate treatment is immune modulator and respiratory support\n\n\n\nThe need for biomarkers for different stages of disease (and how that shapes treatment)\n\nStanley suggests we need better biomarkers for different stages of disease\nBecause with different patients in different disease courses, one has to be ready to modulate therapy\nIn other words, certain therapies may only be effective when administered at a particular stage of the disease process\n\nHow might this be done? What might those biomarkers look like?\n\nIdeally, you want to be able to look in the blood for things like cytokines and metabolic products\nYou’d be trying to figure out whether a person was likely to progress to severe disease or not\nWe’d also want to understand a person’s physiologic age (rather than chronologic age) since, for example, a 40 year old with diabetes might be more susceptible than a 60 year old who is metabolically healthy\n\nWe will be much better prepared in the future if we use machine learning to help us combine our knowledge of:\n\nExisting epidemiology data available about who is more susceptible \nConsider the different physiologic age (rather than chronological age)\nPlus the timing of “when” you are getting the disease\n\n-In practice:\n\nIdeally, you’d like to take people, sample them every couple of days put them in a machine learning model to measure different cytokines and markers to determine whether or not that person is going to progress to severe disease\nBecause that person, if you saw signs of things going badly, perhaps it would warrant the use of…\n\nRemdesivir, for example, to stop the virus in its tracks, or\nAn immune activator if appropriate\n\n\nBut.. “We’re not there yet in terms of thinking about which markers are best.”\n\n \nAlternative hypothesis to the origin of SARS-CoV-2 [1:32:30]\nWall Street Journal article by Matt Ridley\n\nCiting this paper by Zhan et al.\nThe article points out that the current coronavirus is remarkably fit for humans and that it appears to be a mostly a person-to-person transmission\nIt calls into question whether this virus could have actually been transmitted from an animal to a human as recent as Nov/Dec 2019\nThe implication is that SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved to live in humans for a long time before it appeared on our radar in December 2019\n\n \nDetermining durable immunity to COVID-19 and what a successful vaccine looks like [1:34:30]\nKey questions:\nFor the tens of millions (perhaps hundreds of millions) of people who have been infected with COVID-19, what is going to be the durability of their immunity to getting reinfection?\n\nWe can make progress in our understanding of this question by measuring their antibody responses and their T-cell responses\nStanley says that the most likely answer is that we’re going to see waning immunity with people with mild disease (like we see for the common cold coronavirus infections)\n\nWhat will a successful vaccine look like? \n\nThere’s two goals for a vaccine:\n\n1—To protect the individual who’s vaccinated from getting severe pneumonia\n\n(actually, that may occur already … people who had a mild case may not be immune to reinfection but they may be immune to an infection that gives them severe pneumonia)\n\n\n2—How much immunity do you need to prevent transmissibility to other people? \n\nThis may be the most important question, not to the individual, but to society\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case where SARS-CoV-2 can’t be fully eradicated, how do we coexist with this virus moving forward?\n⇒ See Peter’s post trying to answer this question\n\nThis question becomes even more relevant if vaccines are somewhat risky\nEverything is going to be a risk tradeoff and it may be that you don’t not want to vaccinate everybody with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine if the risk is slightly higher than we deem acceptable\nThis generates a situation that warrants a cost-benefit analysis\n\nWill herd immunity even be possible if immunity to SARS-CoV-2 goes away after a year?\n\nThat’s really the key question, says Stanley\nOne possibility is that you may see an ability to get reinfected but the reinfection will only produce a common cold and no pneumonia (but that would require a mutation that may not be likely)\nAnd furthermore, for those hypothetical people who are reinfected, what is their level of shedding (i.e., transmissibility)?\nThe simplest study would be to take some human volunteers, give them a common cold coronavirus and then a year later come back reintroduce the same virus and see if:\n\ni) do they get a cold? And \nii) How much shedding do they have? \n\n\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialEpisode of The Drive with David Watkins: #115 – David Watkins, Ph.D.: A masterclass in immunology, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine strategies for COVID-19 | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [1:30, 24:45, 1:15:45]\nDiscovery of corona virus in chickens in 1930s and people were identified with viruses that caused the common cold that had the same appearance as the infectious bronchitis in 1960: History and Recent Advances in Coronavirus Discovery (Kahn & McIntosh, 2005) [17:15]\nSARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, can infect animals: [18:30]\n\nQuestions and Answers on COVID-19 | (oie.int)\nBronx Zoo Tiger Is Sick With the Coronavirus | Joseph Goldstein (nytimes.com)\n\nEarliest coronaviruses discovered (mostly common colds): [23:45]\n\nHCoV-229E | (wikipedia.org)\nHCoV-OC43 | (wikipedia.org)\nHCoV NL63 | (wikipedia.org)\nHCoV-HKU1  | (wikipedia.org)\n\nA mild infection may results in a more transient immune response: COVID-19 and Postinfection Immunity Limited Evidence, Many Remaining Questions (Kirkcaldy et al., 2020) [24:15]\nPhysician who is considered “Patient Zero” of SARS: Inside the hospital where Patient Zero was infected | SCMP Reporter (scmp.com) [30:30]\nMeasles has an approx.
