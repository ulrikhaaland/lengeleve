  "content": "In this episode, David Watkins, professor of pathology at George Washington University, shares how insights from his HIV and Zika virus research could apply to SARS-CoV-2 protection strategies. David introduces monoclonal antibodies as an intervention to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection, and also discusses how they could be used as a hedge to vaccine development. Additionally, David’s immunology tutorial explains the innate and adaptive immune systems and their differentiated responses to viral infection.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#115 - David Watkins, Ph.D.: A masterclass in immunology, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine strategies for COVID-19\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#115 - David Watkins, Ph.D.: A masterclass in immunology, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine strategies for COVID-19\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#115 - David Watkins, Ph.D.: A masterclass in immunology, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine strategies for COVID-19\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nBackground and current interest in immunology [4:30];\nImmunology 101—The innate and adaptive immune system [10:15];\nDefining antibodies, importance of neutralizing antibodies, and serology testing for COVID-19 [19:00];\nB cells—How they fight viruses, create antibodies, and fit into the vaccine strategy [25:00];\nT cells—Role in the adaptive immune system and ability to kill infected cells to prevent viral spread [36:15];\nValuable lessons from HIV applied to SARS-CoV-2 [51:00];\nLessons to be taken from the hepatitis C success story [1:01:30];\nMonoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and the most promising strategy for preventing and treating COVID-19 infection [1:04:45];\nCOVID-19 vaccines in development [1:19:00];\nHow David’s work with Zika virus informs his thinking on SARS-CoV-2 [1:25:20];\nWhy a vaccine for COVID-19 doesn’t need to be perfect to be effective [1:27:45];

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

Adaptive immune system. Image credit: chegg.com\n \nDefining antibodies, importance of neutralizing antibodies, and serology testing for COVID-19 [19:00]\nWhen you get infected with a virus…\n\nThe first antibody that shows up is Immunoglobulin M (IgM)\nBut the IgM antibodies fade away after 2 or 3 months\nSo if you get a serology test and you see IgM then that means you recently had the virus\nAfter the IgM tails off, you will get IgG antibodies\nThese are the antibodies that will contain your neutralizing antibodies (ones that actually prevent an infection)\n(Although, IgM antibodies can also carry out neutralization)\n\nAn experiment displaying the enormous variability from person to person (Upcoming paper out of the Rockefeller lab)\n\n70 people who had coronavirus \nThey looked for the presence of neutralizing antibodies\nAlmost 20% of them did not make neutralizing antibodies\nIn other words, 20% of people that had IgG/IgM antibodies did not actually have antibodies that could neutralize the virus when a special assay was done\nFurthermore, each person made a different volume (titer) of neutralizing antibodies (some made tons and others made little)\nIt’s unclear how those 20% without neutralizing antibodies were able to survive the virus/or how they clinically responded to the virus\n\nI.e., They could have had a lower inoculum of infection, or they might have been asymptomatic \n\n\n\n-David’s takeaway:\n\nThere’s enormous variability in the B cell response to coronavirus\nThe B cell response is what creates antibodies\nThe open questions are… \n\nCan those individuals that did NOT make a good neutralizing antibody response be reinfected? \nIf so, how soon after?\nAnd that ability to be infected… does it correlate with neutralizing antibodies in the serum? \n\n\n\n \nB cells—How they fight viruses, create antibodies, and fit into the vaccine strategy [25:00]\nDefining attenuated virus and vaccines\n⇒ Example—17D yellow fever vaccine \n\nThis is a very successful, attenuated vaccine \nIt was derived from somebody in Africa who had yellow fever, then put into monkeys, then in the laboratory for many rounds of tissue culture\nWhat emanated was a virus that was weakened (i.e., attenuated virus)\nThis attenuated virus has many differences genetically from the original virus in Africa\nBut when the attenuated vaccine is injected into a human…\n\nThe virus will replicate\nThe innate immune and adaptive immune system will respond\nT cells and B cells will be generated\nAntibodies will then be generated against the vaccine virus\n\n\nThe best vaccines are often using attenuated (weakened) versions of the original virus\nSome drawbacks of attenuated viruses:\n\nSome people’s immune responses can not handle the attenuated virus (usually older people)\n1 in 300,000, will get sick from the virus and some of them will die\n\n\n⇒ Other examples of live attenuated viruses: measles, mumps, and chicken pox\n\nWhen studying immune responses to the 17D yellow fever vaccine…\n\nAll the vaccinated individuals make “beautiful” neutralizing antibody responses against 17D yellow fever\nEven if you dilute their serum to 1 in 5,000, it will still stop the virus from infecting cells\nHowever, there’s a large range in the ability of the people that were vaccinated to respond to the wild-type virus\nFor example, when they took the virus out of a dead monkey that died of yellow fever…\n\nA few individuals didn’t make any responses against the wild-type primary islet because these viruses that come right out of a monkey, for example, are incredibly well adapted to replicating in the monkey and have not been adapted to replicate in tissue culture\nAnd this primary islet is incredibly important to test any vaccine against\n\n\n\nSummary of how B cells work against a virus:\n\nThe B cells arrive pretty soon after that innate response takes place\nNext, they go through an evolutionary replicative cycle until they converge on the perfect antigen\nThe antibodies eventually reach affinity matured—meaning they get better and better at binding to the piece of virus that they attach to\n\nThis occurs in the lymph nodes where the architecture is very important because you’ve got T cells that are absolutely necessary to help them develop in those lymph nodes \n\n\nThen they exit the lymph nodes about 7 to 14 days later, and then they become either:\n\na) Memory B cells—which are very small B cells that circulate, or\nb) Plasma cells—big cells in the bone marrow which essentially become the factories of antibodies\n\n\nIf one of those plasma cells is making considerable amounts of neutralizing antibodies, you will be protected from an infection with that virus that you’ve just seen for a long time\n*Note*: That will vary from virus to virus, but that’s essentially the ontogeny and evolution of the B cell response\n\nImplications when doing serology testing for coronavirus:\n\nToday, when someone is getting checked for antibodies for coronavirus…\nIt’s quantifying the number of IgG or IgM \nBut it doesn’t tell you if those antibodies on the region of the spike protein on the surface of the virus that is critical in binding to the receptor on the human cells for entry\n\n*In other words, it’s not distinguishing whether or not neutralizing antibodies are present \n\n\nWe know that neutralizing antibodies are very important, but the value of those antibodies that are not neutralizing is unclear\n\n \nT cells—Role in the adaptive immune system and ability to kill infected cells to prevent viral spread [36:15]\nT cells are the other arm of the adaptive immune system\n⇒ A good example of the power of T cells is looking at the CD8 T cell\n\nDavid made a discovery in the early days of HIV in the animal model of HIV infection called simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)\n\nNote: SIV is a RNA virus and it’s notoriously error prone when it copies itself\n\n\nThey infected monkeys with a simian immunodeficiency virus then looked at the virus two weeks later and they couldn’t find the virus that they infected those monkeys with\nThere was a virus replicating in the blood, but it was a new virus\nWhat David discovered was that…\n\nThe T cell response had wiped out the initial infected virus\nAll that was left replicating in that animal now was a virus that had mutations in that area\n\n\n“When you see dramatic effects like this, you understand the power of the cytotoxic T-cell (CD 8/CTL)”\n\nT cells and cancer\n\nDavid says that antibodies which turn on T cells have been show to wipe out tumors in certain instances\nThis is the “awesome power” of the CD8 T cells\nNEJM paper: Release the Hounds! Activating the T-Cell Response to Cancer \n\nFailed attempt to develop a T cell vaccine for HIV\n\nDavid “fell in love” with T cells\nHe spent 20 years trying to make a vaccine against HIV based on inducing T cell responses, but he “failed spectacularly” and was not able to make it work\nRecently, he discovered the power and the beauty of B cell responses and antibody evolution (explained earlier in the podcast)\nBut the same way in which a B cell antibody evolves to become the perfect fit binding antibody…is the same way that the HIV virus had evolved in the face of this CD8 T cell onslaught\n\n“There’s two sides of the same coin.”\n\n\n\nHow killer T cells kill viruses\n\nA T cell kills a virus with a completely different method than B cells\nOnce a virus enters a cell, it will make thousands of copies of itself and released them into the blood\nAn antibody (from a B cell) can stop the virus from getting into the cell (that’s proven difficult to do with HIV)\nBut once that virus is in the cell, the antibody cannot do anything\nThis is where a T cell comes into the picture\n\n–An infected cell is like a virus factory—and you need to shut that virus factory down\n\nWhat we need is a cell that can recognize an infected cell and kill it before it releases all the progeny virus\nAnd it has to be able to recognize an infected from an uninfected cell\nAnd that is what a CD8 T cell does in a very elegant way\nWhen the virus binds to the receptor and gets into the cell, it starts to make its own proteins in that cell\nThen we have these “buckets” called major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHC)\nThese buckets sample what’s on the inside of the cell, and they put it up on the surface of the cell\nAnd in the buckets on the cell’s surface are pieces of the virus in an infected cell\nSo a killer T cell will come along and it will looks for non normal cells\nIf it finds one, It binds to that and it blows holes in that infected cell to close the factory down\nSo these MHC buckets are like “flags” on the surface of an infected cell that say, “kill me”\nA CD8 T cell plays a critically important role in almost any viral infection\n\nHelper T cells\n\nYou need both arms of the adaptive immune system, \n\ni) antibodies and their ability to neutralize viruses before they infect cells, and\nii) killer T cells to shut down infected cells\n\n\nHowever, we can’t generate either of those without helper T cells \nHelper T cells (e.g., CD4) are important for providing a milieu for the development of the CD8 killer cells and for the B cells\nThe most dramatic example of the importance of CD4 cells is HIV\n\nOther examples of killer T cells at work…\n\nYou can’t get a skin graft from someone else because T cells would recognize the skin as foreign because of the MHC molecules presenting the foreign cells on the surface\nT cells have a role in stopping cancer, i.e. cells that do not respond to normal cell cycle growth, and yet they will not go on to develop cancer anytime soon because the CD8 cell is able to recognize those cancer cells as non-self, which is the key determinant and to eradicate them\nWith organ transplantation, we have to give patients who have been given a transplanted organ immune suppressing drugs which is really suppressing the arm of the immune system to prevent them from doing their job\n\n \nValuable lessons from HIV applied to SARS-CoV-2 [51:00]\nWhy there hasn’t been a successful HIV vaccine:\n\nMost vaccines are based on immunizing an individual so that they develop neutralizing antibodies\nThere are very few T cell-based vaccines\nFor HIV, the first attempt was to make neutralizing antibodies by vaccination, but it’s very difficult to make a neutralizing antibody against HIV and SIV (primate equivalent of HIV)\n\n–When someone is infected with HIV (or a monkey with SIV)….\n\nProblem 1: Huge population of the virus with enormous variability in the virus\n\n10 to 100 million copies of virus per ML in those first few weeks\nAlmost all of them are different\n\nSo when you talk about HIV, you’re basically talking about lots of different HIV\n\n\nThe question for a vaccinologist: How am I going to make a vaccine that I’m going to give to 100 people, but those 100 people are all going to be exposed to different viruses?\n\n\nProblem 2: We’ve been unable to generate by vaccination a neutralizing antibody against HIV\n\nFor example, you can vaccinate monkeys for SIV and generate huge levels of antibodies that bind but none of them seem to neutralize the virus\n\nAnd that’s due to the biology of the virus\n\nThere are very few copies of envelope on the surface of a HIV variant \nThat envelope is a protein, but it’s covered in a shield of sugars making it hard to get in and to bind to the regions of the envelope that are important for binding the CD4 and getting into the cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we’ve stopped the HIV epidemic without a vaccine:\n\nThe advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the mid-’90s\nWithin a span of about two years, HIV went from uniformly fatal to a chronic disease where people can live with T-cell counts that would’ve rendered them dead within months in the past\nIn other words, the HIV epidemic was stopped without a vaccine\n\n“As we stand here with the coronavirus epidemic three months old, I think we should have faith that science will find a solution to this.”\nWhat led up to that point…\n\nRon Desrosiers of the New England Primate Center, isolated a virus that looked very similar to HIV (SIV) which became animal model that we are able to test therapies on\nNext came the behavioral method to slow the transmission,  using condoms \n\n*For coronavirus, that means social distancing\n\n\nNext came a repurposed drug called AZT\nThis brought virus loads down but they would come back up because the virus’s ability to escape\nThen Ray Schinazi discovered that a combination drugs was an effective treatment and this was the “game changer”\nIn parallel, David and others were working on vaccines and immune responses and found that the virus could escape from just about any immune response thrown at it\nFinally, the groundbreaking PrEP studies (Pre-exposure prophylaxis) resulted in TRUVADA which prevents a sexually active person from getting infected with HIV\nWe still have a large number of people already infected and they need to get on treatment, but in that example, science found a solution to the epidemic \nIn short, the epidemic was solved without a vaccine\n\n“Many of us that worked in the HIV epidemic are now better able to deal with the coronavirus because we’ve learned a lot of valuable lessons from HIV.”\n \nLessons to be taken from the hepatitis C success story [1:01:30]\nHepatitis C\n\nHepatitis C is a virus that replicates to enormous levels, even higher than HIV\nIt similarly generates lots and lots of variants \nIt’s a virus that’s going to be very, very difficult to find a vaccine for. \nRay Schinazi, PhD biochemist, was involved in the discovery of these first drugs that not only treat Hep C, but they cure Hep C\n\nPeter’s view on this: \n\nIt’s quite possible there has been no greater advancement in medicine in the past 10 years than the drugs that cure Hep C\nHep B, Hep C, and HIV are the “big 3” of bloodborne transmission viruses\nHep C probably has the quickest consequences if you are untreated\nHep B can be vaccinated against\nHIV, while there is no cure or vaccine, it was not as easy to transmit (e.g., A solid needle, going through a double glove is pretty low transmission)\nBut Hep C was a very transmissible virus, and when Peter was in med school 20 years ago, there was no treatment and no vaccine\nIf you got Hep C, you had a 40-50% chance of dying of liver failure \nBut today, there’s a 30 to 60-day course of a medication which cures the person with Hep C\nIn other words, still no vaccine, but there is a cure for Hep C\n\n \nMonoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and the most promising strategy for preventing and treating COVID-19 infection [1:04:45]\nCOVID-19 in context\n\nDavid believes we will have a much better ability to create a vaccine for COVID-19 compared to HIV or even the 1918 flu\nHow much worse is this than the common flu?\n\nPeter’s take is that it’s nowhere near the original thought of being 25x worse\nPeter thinks when you look at the IFR, and especially if you age stratify, it’s probably 2-8x “worse” than the flu\nDavid thinks it’s probably closer to 10x worse\nAnd he points out there’s still much we don’t know\n\nE.g., What about the amount of virus that you see initially? \n\n\n\n\n\nPromising observations about coronavirus\n\nCoronavirus has much, much less ability to “escape” compared to HIV\nAlso, it’s not a chronic virus meaning it’s possible to generate an antibody response\n\nUnknowns about antibodies\n\nIt’s unclear the exact titer of neutralizing antibodies needed\nIn terms of the ability to generate neutralizing antibodies, we don’t yet know…\n\nWhat percentage of antibodies are neutralizing\n\n“The key experiments are putting these vaccine concepts into humans and looking at their neutralizing antibody response. But we don’t know what levels of neutralizing antibody responses will be sufficient to prevent infection. And I think that’s a very important issue.”\n\n\nWe don’t know the frequency of people who would be able to develop them\nWe don’t know the duration that they will last in terms of protection from reinfection\n\n“Duration is a key issue with respect to infected people and with respect to vaccines because you’ve got to make a neutralizing response and then you’ve got to keep that neutralizing response up to a level where it will prevent infection.”\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies for preventing COVID-19 infection\n“The most exciting hope that we have for treating [coronavirus] is neutralizing antibodies delivered as monoclonal antibodies.”\n⇒ Explaining how using monoclonal antibodies could prevent COVID-19\n\nIn the case of an attenuated yellow fever vaccine, if you vaccinated 100 people…\n\n~90% of them will make a response against the vaccine virus\n~20% of them won’t make a response against the wild type virus (the live virus that circulated) so they’re going to be susceptible to infection\n\n\nBut you’re going to have a few individuals that are going to make wonderful antibody responses against the vaccine virus AND the wild type virus\nYou then go in and get the memory B cells of those people\nThen you clone the genes of those neutralizing antibodies that have reached affinity maturation and now bind very well to the piece of virus that prevents the virus from getting inside the cell\nNext, you test them in animal models\nThen I’m going to grow them up in large vats \nFinally, you inject these monoclonal antibodies into people, say at a nursing home in the case of COVID-19, “and that is going to prevent infection”\nHow long will that last? ⇒ Probably 3 to 6 months depending on the dose you give and how you genetically engineer that antibody\n“This is the most exciting aspect and the most hopeful treatment for coronavirus, and it’s a new type of vaccinology, if you will.”\n\n“I think the way forward for the vaccine field is to get those individuals that make the best antibody responses, clone their best antibodies, grow them up in vats, and then distribute that to the people that need it. And this can be used for prevention and it can be used for treatment.”\nA combo of vaccine plus monoclonal antibodies is the most promising strategy\n–The goal of a vaccine, for the most part, is a B cell strategy\n\nWhich is put in some form of attenuated/inactivated virus that elicits an immune response that is appropriate\nIf we’re lucky, the B cell immune response generates specific antibodies called neutralizing antibodies. \nIf we’re lucky, we get big effector B cells that turn into plasma cells which hang out in bone marrow for when you see this infection again \n\n–In parallel, you can pursue the monoclonal antibody strategy: \n\nFirst, figure out who the “Olympic champions of making neutralizing antibodies” are \nThen, using recombinant engineering/recombinant DNA technology, you make synthetic copies \nNext, you inject the neutralizing antibodies into people so that even if their own B cells aren’t able to make neutralizing antibodies, they will have them to fight off the virus \nThe main issue: They only last maybe 3 to 6 months so they will need to be injected at some regular frequency, say two to four times per year\n\n-David’s response:\n\nLet’s not forget that a cheap vaccine is really the best way to go with all of this\nAnd David thinks one of the vaccine approaches will result in durable neutralizing antibodies\nA vaccination would increase herd immunity in the younger people by vaccination and therefore reduce the number of transmission events to the elderly\nHOWEVER, the elderly don’t do so well with vaccines b/c they don’t make such robust immune responses\nSo, injecting them with a combination of monoclonal antibodies would be the way to go in the older population\n\nHow feasible is creating and distributing a monoclonal antibody vaccination?\n\nWell, Humira, one of the most prescribed drugs that we have today, is a monoclonal antibody that’s repeatedly given to people.\nThe advent of monoclonal antibodies is going to be very important to treat infectious diseases and may be the way of the future, says David\n\n***\nEbola treatment of monoclonal antibodies that neutralizes the virus dropped the death rates significantly: Two Ebola drugs show promise amid ongoing outbreak | Amy Maxmen (nature.com)\n\nREGN-EB3 | (wikipedia.org)\n\nOngoing trial using monoclonal antibodies to neutralize HIV to see if it can prevent infection in Africa: HVTN 703/HPTN 081 | (hptn.org)\n \nCOVID-19 vaccines in development [1:19:00]\n\nAttenuated and inactive virus vaccines make up the majority of vaccines\n\nExamples of attenuated virus vaccines: measles, mumps, and varicella zoster\nExamples of inactive virus vaccines: Polio, hepatitis A, and rabies \n\n\nMore rarely, vaccines are made with spike protein: E.g., Hep B and HPV\n\nYet, most of the current vaccine approaches are newer approaches of taking DNA or mRNA from these viruses or spike proteins directly\n\nA few groups working on vaccines include: Pfizer, U of Oxford, Moderna\nVia WedMD: COVID-19 Vaccine: Latest Updates\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13223\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Figure-adapted-with-leading-COVID19-vaccination-groups-847x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"847\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Figure-adapted-with-leading-COVID19-vaccination-groups-847x1024.png 847w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Figure-adapted-with-leading-COVID19-vaccination-groups-248x300.png 248w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Figure-adapted-with-leading-COVID19-vaccination-groups-768x929.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Figure-adapted-with-leading-COVID19-vaccination-groups-1270x1536.png 1270w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Figure-adapted-with-leading-COVID19-vaccination-groups.png 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px\" />\nFigure 3. Leading COVID19 vaccination groups. Image credit: scientificamerican.com\nWhy might there be concern with using attenuated versions in a human vaccine?\n\nDavid explains with an example… \n\nRon Desrosier (the guy who isolated SIV and the subsequent clones of that virus), discovered that if you attenuate SIV by knocking out a piece of Nef and you infect animals, the virus still replicates but it’s weak with a very low level of replication\n20 weeks later, those animals are protected from the wild type virus\nGreat, right?\nHowever, it was noticed that monkeys that were given this Nef-attenuated virus, many years later started developing clinical signs of SIV infection\nIt had repaired itself and was now pathogenic\n\n\nAnother experiment by David…\n\nDavid took attenuated virus-infected monkeys and then challenged them with a different virus\nThere was some level of protection\nHowever, a few animals had very, very high virus loads and we’re not protected at all \nThe incoming virus had recombined with a vaccine virus to form an entirely new virus that was highly pathogenic\n\n\n\n“You have to be very, very careful before going into thousands and millions of people with whatever vaccine construct you might have.”\n-Every way to make a COVID-19 vaccine is being tried at the moment:\n\nThe Oxford approach, for example, is to use a chimp adenovirus to express the spike protein of the coronavirus\n\nThey want to see what neutralizing antibodies that generates\nWhat is the neutralizing titer\nAnd how long does that antibody titer stay there\n\n\nNot necessarily just in monkeys, in humans, because in the end, that’s the only experiment that we truly care about.\n\nThe goal of a COVID-19 vaccine is different than HIV\n\nIn the case of HIV, we’re trying to provide sterilizing immunity because once HIV starts replicating it forms the necessary mutations to escape from any sort of immune response\nIn the case of coronavirus, we’re trying to knock down initial virus inoculum to a level where it doesn’t cause symptoms as well as reduces the amount of transmission\n\n \nHow David’s work with Zika virus informs his thinking on SARS-CoV-2 [1:25:20]\nIs there anything that you’ve learned through your years of studying Zika that factors into how you think about coronavirus?\n\nZika virus is only a problem if it infects pregnant women\nThere are many children that don’t look as if they’re unusual, but because this virus infects brain tissue, they will have many, many neurological deficits\nI think a vaccine against Zika virus faces the same problems that you need to induce neutralizing antibodies that can be durable\n\nDavid’s Zika monoclonal antibody approach\n\nIn collaboration with Dennis Burton, they made antibodies that could be injected into monkeys and completely prevent infection\nThey did the same experiment on pregnant monkeys that were already infected but could not prevent transmission to the fetus\n\n \nWhy a vaccine for COVID-19 doesn’t need to be perfect to be effective [1:27:45]\nWhen developing any drugs/vaccines for a virus, the approach you might take depends on…\n\ni) the biology of the virus and \nii) what you need to do to ameliorate suffering from that virus\n\nA vaccine for COVID-19\nWe don’t need a vaccine that is perfect, it just has to be good enough\n\nIt must have neutralizing antibodies\nIt has to reduce the viral load because \n\ni) that would reduce the transmission, and \nii) the viral load is proportional to the damage \n\nMore virus is more entry through cells that bear the ACE-2 receptor\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming we could reduce the viral load upon first contact by 70-80% through some combination of monoclonal antibodies or effective vaccines…\n\nThat could have a commensurate reduction in mortality and spread\nAnd much of the damage out the gate with coronavirus was nosocomial (transmission within hospitals) which also probably means higher viral loads\nSo a combo therapy of a non-perfect vaccine with monoclonal antibodies that could reduce viral load would be crucial \n\nMonoclonal antibodies\n“Monoclonal antibodies, for me, are the way forward to prevent and treat almost all infectious disease. And they’re a logical extension of a vaccine.”\n\nDavid’s lab is trying to develop monoclonal antibodies against both this novel coronavirus\nWhile also keeping an eye toward the future on the next one that is evitable \nMaking monoclonal antibodies simply means …\n\ntaking from the best responders with the best antibodies\nCloning them and \ndistributing that to everybody \nBecause we’re not all able to make those robust and highly specific and high-binding neutralizing antibodies\n\n\n\nOne last message from David: Try everything, create a combination of approaches, and value human data above all else\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialNEJM paper about T cells and cancer: Release the Hounds!

Dr. Watkins was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology and was Vice Chair of Research in Pathology at the University of Miami, prior to this recent transition. David’s early work was focused on the similarities between non-human primate Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) which then progressed into investigating novel ways to make an effective vaccine against HIV using the yellow fever vaccine. Watkins was also involved in developing a treatment against ZIKA virus during the viral outbreak of 2015-2016. He is currently involved in applying his knowledge and experience with HIV and ZIKA to the COVID-19 therapeutic landscape."
