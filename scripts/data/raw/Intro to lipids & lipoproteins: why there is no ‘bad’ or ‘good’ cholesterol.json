  "title": "Intro to lipids & lipoproteins: why there is no ‘bad’ or ‘good’ cholesterol",
  "content": "I recently posted on Twitter about my frustration with the way the press writes about “good” and “bad” cholesterol, and several people then asked me for the TL;DR version of ‘cholesterol 101.’ As I realize not everyone can take the time to go through the many hours of cholesterol content we have on The Drive, here is my attempt at explaining the basics of lipids, lipoproteins, and why there is no such thing as “good” or “bad” cholesterol.\n<iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eod36TNGcUI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\nOf course, if you really want to understand the field of lipidology, there is no substitute for going through our past cholesterol content. But in this video, you can certainly learn far more than most health journalists will ever know (and even more than some doctors know).\nIf you do want to dive into this topic more, check out some of the following content:\n\n\n\nAMA #34: What causes heart disease? | April 18, 2022\nPeter on how early and aggressive lowering of apoB could change the course of ASCVD | April 11, 2022\n 6-Part Series on Lipidology with Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLAA | October 15, 2018"
