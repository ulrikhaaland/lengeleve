Based on his work with metformin, Nir shares how he believes it could be a pro-longevity drug and the clinical trial he’s leading to test this belief. Joan discusses her work with rapalogs, their ability to suppress the immune system as well as provide immune-enhancement, and the clinical trials she has led that inform her insights. We also talk about the potential beneficial roles of both metformin and rapamycin in reducing mortality from COVID-19, reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and delaying aging as well as its related diseases.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#123 - Joan Mannick, M.D. & Nir Barzilai, M.D.: Rapamycin and metformin—longevity, immune enhancement, and COVID-19\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#123 - Joan Mannick, M.D. & Nir Barzilai, M.D.: Rapamycin and metformin—longevity, immune enhancement, and COVID-19\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#123 - Joan Mannick, M.D. & Nir Barzilai, M.D.: Rapamycin and metformin—longevity, immune enhancement, and COVID-19\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nJoan’s career, interest in aging, and work with rapamycin analogs [3:45];\nWhen Nir became convinced metformin could be a pro-longevity agent [15:00];\nHow metformin and rapamycin impact the hallmarks of aging and extend lifespan [24:15];\nEnhancing the immune system with rapalogs and metformin [34:15];\nPotential of metformin and rapamycin in reducing mortality from COVID-19 [41:30];\nInsights from Joan’s studies investigating the immune-enhancing effects of rapalogs [59:30];\nVaccines and treatments strategies for COVID-19, and the likelihood of long-term immunity [1:08:15];\nThe potential role of rapalogs and metformin in neurodegenerative disease [1:14:30];\nNir’s TAME trial—primary objectives and latest updates [1:18:00];\nPotential synergistic effect when combining metformin with rapamycin [1:25:45];\nWhy Peter stopped taking metformin and started taking rapamycin [1:27:30];\nStory from Nir’s book that demonstrates the challenge of doing good scientific studies [1:37:30];\nThe biology of aging—epigenetic clocks, proteomics, and Nir’s centenarian data [1:42:00];\nJoan’s dream experiment to test immune-enhancing effect of RTB101 [1:57:15];\nConcluding thoughts on COVID-19 [1:59:45];

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

Miller et al., 2011)\nThis was enough for Joan to feel that “Someone’s just got to do the trial in humans and see if this is true in humans”\n\nJoan’s 2014 paper at Novartis\n\nKnowing that the only way this will ever move forward is if the drug was safe and did not suppress the immune system, they started with a very low dose with intermittent dosing \nThey were looking to see if the patients had an enhanced immune response to the flu vaccine \n\n-Study details \n\nThe drug used was RAD001 (a.k.a. everolimus)\nThe doses given to the 4 different arms—\n\n1) Placebo arm \n2) 0.5 mgs of RAD001 daily\n3) 5 mgs once a week \n4) 20 mgs once a week\n\n\nThe goal was to partially inhibit mTOR, because when you completely inhibit mTOR, you stop T cells from proliferating and you’ll get immunosuppressed\n\n-The ending observations: \n\n\n\nThe two lower doses (0.5 mgs daily and 5 mgs once a week) were the best\nTurning mTOR down (not off) in the elderly is the best for enhancing immune function\n\n\n\n \nWhen Nir became convinced metformin could be a pro-longevity agent [15:00]\n\nThe normal clinical indication of metformin is an early-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes\nWhile at Yale doing his first postdoc with Ralph DeFronzo, Nir spent the year looking for the mechanism of action of metformin (which wasn’t yet being used in the US)\nIn 1991, Nir’s study was the first to show that metformin specifically targets hepatic glucose production — aka the insulin sensitivity of the liver much more so than the muscle\nMetformin finally began gaining more interest in the US after the DPP found metformin was people from developing diabetes\nThere were also many association studies with all kinds of cancer as well as Alzheimer’s disease and MCI\nThe turning point for Nir came when he read a paper showing that people on metformin, even those who were diabetic and obese, had less mortality when compared to control patients without diabetes who were not taking metformin\n\n⇒ Nir’s 2016 paper talking about the UKPDS and DPP papers: Metformin as a Tool to Target Aging\n“And all of a sudden we have everything. We have all ages, all the old age-related disease, clinical association studies, we’d have mortality. That just made metformin the perfect tool for us to push geroscience ahead.” —Nir Barzilai\nITP studies\nWhat is the ITP?\n\nThe interventions testing program is a multi-institutional program established to test diets, supplements, and drugs purported to extend lifespan and delay disease and dysfunction to evaluate whether or not there is an effect on longevity\nSee this paper describing how the ITP studies are designed\nYou have a committee, you get the drug, you have animals who are genetically heterogeneous, they animals get the drug in the same was in three different centers around the United States so that we have a standard way to say “yes or no” to whether it’s pro-longevity\n\nIn cohort 7, they tested metformin alone, and metformin plus rapamycin, in mice—\n\nMetformin only:\n\nIn two of the centers, the mice they lived longer (13% and 10%)\nBut in the third center, mice lived 1% less\n\n\nMetformin plus rapamycin:\n\nMice had a 23% increase in lifespan\nThese are the longest-living animals so far in the ITP\n\n\n\nITP studies for rapamycin alone—\n\nIn cohort 2, mice given rapamycin alone starting at 20 months of age extended lifespan by 14% in females and 9% in males\nIn cohort 3, mice given rapamycin alone starting at 9 months of age extended lifespan by 10% in males and 18% in females\nSee the ongoing ITP studies looking at rapamycin: The Rapamycin Phase II Study – Tissues Available for Collaborative Studies\n\nThe lack of enthusiasm about metformin for longevity\n\nIn the metformin alone ITP studies, 1 of the 3 sites showed no improvement of lifespan\nThis means there are now people who are not impressed with metformin as a longevity agent\n*But Nir makes the following point: It’s a little bit too late to discuss mice now, because we have all this data in humans. It’s possible that metformin will have a better effect in humans than in mice.\n\n \nHow metformin and rapamycin impact the hallmarks of aging and extend lifespan [24:15]\nNir’s recent paper in Cell Metabolism: Benefits of Metformin in Attenuating the Hallmarks of Aging\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13537\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/metformin-hallmarks-of-aging-1024x553.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"553\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/metformin-hallmarks-of-aging-1024x553.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/metformin-hallmarks-of-aging-300x162.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/metformin-hallmarks-of-aging-768x415.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/metformin-hallmarks-of-aging-1536x829.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/metformin-hallmarks-of-aging-2048x1105.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 1. Mechanisms of metformin action in attenuating hallmarks of biological aging—The cellular uptake of metformin is via the organic cationic transporter 1 (OCT1), after which it exerts three arms of action- 1) metabolic; 2) oxidative and 3) inflammatory. 1) Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I and thereby oxidative phosphorylation leading to an increased AMP:ATP ratio, causing a direct activation of AMPK. AMPK-dependent mechanisms (blue) contribute to the downstream inhibition of mTORC1 (improved nutrient-sensing and autophagy), activation of PGC-1α (improved mitochondrial biogenesis), transcriptional regulation via DNA/histone modifications and miRNAs. Extracellularly, metformin downregulated Insulin/IGF1 signaling, also leading to mTORC1 inhibition. 2) The inhibition of mitochondrial ETC also leads to AMPK-independent effects (red) including reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and thereby reduced macromolecular damage. 3) The AMPK-independent (red) anti-inflammatory and senotherapeutic effects of metformin are evident via the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, NF-κB signaling, and activation of Nrf2-Gpx7 and ATM-signaling, respectively. These three arms work to mitigate the aging-induced dysregulation in cells, thereby attenuating hallmarks of aging. Image credit: Kulkarni et al., 2020\nHow Metformin is working for longevity \n\nNir does NOT believe metformin independently targets all of the hallmarks of aging\nLet’s say that, on the cellular level, it fixes aging\nAnd once it fixes cellular aging, a lot of things improve\nFor example, maybe the fact that insulin levels go down doesn’t ONLY have to do with metformin’s effect on glucose, but because…\n\nAutophagy has increased\nMitochondrial function is better\nGenetic stability is good\nEtc.\n\n\nAfter an experiment where you see so much effect, some might say it’s all epigenetics, but the question is: Did metformin do it? Or is it what metformin did on aging that created the effects?\n\nThree major arms of metformin\n\nMetabolic—targets complex I in the mitochondria which increases AMPK and targets the mTOR pathway\nThere’s a decrease in oxidative stress (ROS production) and a decrease in DNA damage (a consequence of using a low dose of a mitochondrial poison)\nThe relationship to immune function and inflammation\n\n“We have the clinical data on metformin, but I wouldn’t tell you what exactly is the most relevant target in the whole.” —Nir Barzilai\nMechanisms for how rapamycin (and rapalogs) might extend lifespan\n1—Less protein and lipid synthesis which may decrease proteotoxic stress just by having less proteins made that your protein degradation system has to deal with\n2—Autophagy, however, rapalogs don’t consistently induce autophagy\n\nIt’s cell-dependent—so how much of a role autophagy has in the benefits of rapalog is probably tissue-dependent\nIn many cell lines, there’s no induction of autophagy\nIn the few cell lines that do have induction of autophagy, it’s hard to distinguish the tissue of origin (e.g., Is it the liver versus the cells from neurons?) \n\n3—Regulation of the SASPs (similar to metformin)\n\nSenescent cells accumulate as we age resulting in the secretion of inflammatory cytokine\nInhibiting mTOR will decrease SASPs, which will decrease systemic inflammation\n\n \nEnhancing the immune system with rapalogs and metformin [34:15]\nWhy immune enhancement matters\n\nFrom a longevity standpoint—\n\nAnything that you can do that’s going to enhance the immune system at the adaptive level (which is what you’re getting out of a vaccine) is going to help with cancer surveillance\nPrior to COVID-19, Peter’s thought was that the real reason we want to have enhanced immunity is to delay the onset of cancer\n\n\nToday, there’s a heightened focus on coronavirus as well as influenza which makes enhancing immunity more relevant to the present moment\n\nImmune enhancement via rapalogs\nWhy did T cells get better at recognizing an antigen when a patient was pulsed with a drug that is inhibiting senescent cells? (Tissue specific or cell specific autophagy? Reduction in protein synthesis and lipid synthesis?)\n\nIt’s going to be complicated, says Joan\nBut one of the factors and how you respond to a vaccine is actually innate immunity —  you need innate immunity to bring in the adaptive T and B cells to respond to antigen \n\nWhere some of the issues lie for the elderly population—\n\nThey have a defect in type I interferon production after getting a flu vaccine\nThere are all sorts of stimuli to the innate immune system that should induce interferon, but there’s a defect in immune cells\nWith aging comes exhaustion of T cells — but with mTOR inhibition, there’s a decrease in exhausted T-cells in older humans (Tyler Curiel showed the same thing in older mice)\n\nPossible solutions?\n\nJoan has shown that with mTOR inhibitors, you can enhance interferon production in interferon induced gene expression\n\nIn other words, you are enhancing the innate immune function which is helping the adaptive immune system work better when you get vaccinated\n\n\nWhen you give an mTOR inhibitor, in particular a rapalog, T cell exhaustion decreases\n\nJoan says that they don’t yet know the mechanism for that\n\n\n\nNOTE: You can’t just give IV interferon because \n\n1) it’s dangerous, and \n2) It’s not the interferon per se, it’s that the lack of interferon is a proxy for a failure to recognize in the first place\n\nWhat did Joan learn about this in her 2014 paper? Did they look only at T cell or also B cell assays? Did you look at neutralizing antibodies and T cell killing?\n\nThey only looked at hemagglutination inhibition (HI titers)\nDidn’t look at neutralizing antibodies and didn’t look at T cell function\nThey looked at shifts in 76 different peripheral blood subsets—the rapalogs didn’t shift any of the subsets very much, except there was about a 25 to 30% decrease in the PD1, CD4, and CD8—the exhausted T-cells that accumulate with age\nThe fact that these go down may indicate another part of the adaptive immune system that’s getting improved from the rapalog\n\nImmune benefits of metformin\nWhen did it become apparent to Nir that metformin had immune benefits?\n\nIn the 40s-60s, metformin was used around the world for influenza in the elderly\n\nThe literature is in Czech and Swedish and Philippines—with little translation to date—but all of them were positive responses to using Metformin as an immune enhancer against the flu, malaria, and some other indications\n\n\nPatients with type 2 diabetes who were taking metformin immunized better against the flu\n\n \nPotential of metformin and rapamycin in reducing mortality from COVID-19 [41:30]\nIn the case of COVID-19, we need a drug that will—\n\nEnhance immune function \nDecrease the cytokine storm/inflammatory response\nHelp the elderly body sustain a severe disease (i.e., be tough when faced with severe disease)\nAdditionally, you probably wouldn’t just increase their immunity by 10 to 20%, you would reduce their comorbidities first and foremost\n\nMetformin and rapamycin \n\nThese drugs can reduce comorbidities—and by doing so that may confer the mortality benefit as much so as their ability to enhance the immune system\nIt’s also important to note that the reduction in comorbidities and the enhancement of the immune system are NOT dependent on each other\n\nDiabetics on metformin vs. diabetics NOT on metformin\nA paper from China looked at 283 diabetic patients with COVID-19\n\n104 of them came to the hospital already taking metformin\n179 of them were not taking metformin\nJust 2.9% of people on metformin died versus 12.3% of the to no-metformin group who died\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13545\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Luo-et-al.-2020.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"952\" height=\"834\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Luo-et-al.-2020.png 952w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Luo-et-al.-2020-300x263.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Luo-et-al.-2020-768x673.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px\" />\nFigure 2. Although no significant difference was found in the hospital stays between two groups (P = 0.74), the in-hospital mortality of 2.9% (3/104) in the metformin group was markedly decreased compared with the mortality of 12.3% (22/179) in the no-metformin group (P = 0.01). Image credit: Luo et al., 2020\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the use of metformin in China for diabetic people is between 60 and 70% — yet, the most people who were hospitalized were NOT using metformin\n\nThe implication of this observation is potentially that \n\ni) the diabetics on metformin were less likely to need to go to the hospital (or maybe even get COVID-19 at all), and\nii) The mortality from COVID-19 probably had more to do with the cytokine storm/inflammatory response, or with their ability to handle severe disease, than it did with the immunization\n\n\n\n\n\nContrasting influenza with COVID-19\n\nThe main train of thought about how influenza kills people used to be that it can paralyze the immune system making the individual more susceptible to other infections such as a bacterial infection \nHowever, Joans says that may not be the case\nThere is now some debate around that due to a 2015 NEJM paper which looked at what actually causes pneumonia in the elderly that gets them hospitalized\n\nAnd it’s not mainly because of a combination of virus and bacteria (that is some of it) but the majority is the virus itself\nThe most common virus is actually rhinovirus—the cause of the common cold\nThe elderly just can’t handle viruses the same way as younger people do — and they can die without getting bacterial superinfection\nThe virus itself causes damage, and then the immune response to the virus also causes damage\n\n\n\nHow does that impact our thinking about SARS-CoV-2?\n\nIt causes much more direct damage to the pneumocyte, therefore to the end organ\nDo we believe that at the immunologic response level, it is eliciting a much more toxic autoimmune response or cytokine response than say influenza?\nThe coronavirus infects cells, including lung cells, and that causes direct damage from the virus\nThe host response to the virus is generally a good thing because it will get rid of the virus\nHowever, if it gets excessive, you’ll get a cytokine storm which will cause major life threatening consequences independent of the virus\nThe hypothesis: If you can enhance the ability of the host to get control of the virus very early on and quickly, then you won’t be susceptible to the cytokine storm and you will stay with mild disease\n\nHow a rapalog could reduce the risk of succumbing to COVID\nWhere a rapalog has the greatest potential to reduce the risk of succumbing to COVID?\n\nIn people taking mTOR inhibitors, they’re innate antiviral gene expression is enhanced when they get a viral infection\nThis suggests that early on after exposure to the virus, the rapalog may have benefit by boosting the body’s response to the virus so we can clear it better and prevent severe symptoms \n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13544\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/increase-in-antiviral-gene-expression-1024x573.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"573\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/increase-in-antiviral-gene-expression-1024x573.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/increase-in-antiviral-gene-expression-300x168.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/increase-in-antiviral-gene-expression-768x430.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/increase-in-antiviral-gene-expression-1536x859.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/increase-in-antiviral-gene-expression-2048x1145.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 3. RTB101 increased antiviral gene expression. Image credit: Mannick et al., 2019\nHow metformin could reduce risk of succumbing to COVID-19\n\nFirst, the China cohort suggests that the people taking Metformin were disproportionately less severely ill, and therefore less likely to end up in the hospital\nAdditionally, Nir started his own study at Einstein after he got emails from physicians in Spain and Italy who noticed the same thing for patients on metformin\n\nA possible mechanism? ⇒ Recent study published in medRxiv \n\n(caveat=study is not reviewed and lacks details)\nThe study had access to data on over 6,000 patients through the University of Minnesota\n\n–2 things stand out from the study—\n\nWomen on Metformin have 21% less mortality to COVID-19\nEven more important, they had an 80% decrease in plasma TNF alpha levels — so there’s a kind of a link to the inflammatory response\n\nPeter’s takeaway\n\nThere’s no indication that metformin alters ACE-2 expression\nSo any benefits that you’re describing that turn out to be real are either based on—\n\nImmune enhancement; or \nImmune modulation\n\n\nI.e., You’re turning up the immune system when you want it to be turned up or toning it down when you need it to be toned down\n\nNir’s take:\n\nNir thinks it’s doing both (turning up the immune system when you want it to be AND toning it down when you need it to be)\nTwo ways metformin helps—\n\n1) Less people on metformin are hospitalized (i.e., their immunity is better)\n2) When they’re in the hospital, less of them go into an inflammatory response\n\n\nCaveat – the China cohort data doesn’t tell the whole story—it just looked at outcomes (i.e., deaths), so Nir says not to make too much of it\n*His point is this: We really need to look at several issues: i) the immune response, ii) the cytokines, and iii) the ability of the body to sustain severe disease\n\nBut wouldn’t the patients be taken off metformin when they arrive in the hospital?\n\nYes, says Nir\nBut there are still lingering effects even after going off metformin — “When you substantially change the aging phenotype of a cell [with metformin] it’s not that you stop and it goes back to old.

Image credit: resTORbio.com\nPROTECTOR study — the 2019 phase 3 study by resTORbio \n\nThis study used RTB101 alone \nThis study failed to meet its endpoint\nJoan explains why it failed…\n\nThe FDA did not want the endpoint to be laboratory-confirmed respiratory tract infections (which is where Joan had previously seen the benefit of RTB101)\nThe FDA argued that people don’t care if a respiratory tract infection is laboratory-confirmed, all they care about is how they feel and function (e.g., their symptoms)\nThe FDA demanded that they show you can decrease respiratory symptoms that are consistent with a respiratory tract infection, but they don’t have to be due to a respiratory tract infection \nThe study “failed” because they couldn’t decrease the total respiratory symptoms that the elderly have\n\n\nWhy did they show? ⇒ RTB101 was able to decrease the severity of the symptoms\n\n“I think what the mTOR inhibitors are doing is not stopping people from getting infected, but if you get infected, there’s a better immune response and your symptoms will be milder.” —Joan Mannick\nWhat resTORbio is looking at now with respect to COVID:\n\nresTORbio is doing a trial in nursing homes now looking at severity and not just incidence of infection\nJoan’s thought as to why people are having less severe symptoms: “Once you get infected, you’re better able to upregulate the interferon-induced, innate immune response”\n\n \nVaccine and treatment strategies for COVID-19, and the likelihood of long-term immunity [1:08:15]\nVaccines must be developed to be safe and effective in the elderly\n\nNir says that with rapamycin and metformin, the goal is to reinforce the host, not to fight the virus\nWho are the people that are dying from COVID? — It’s the older people\nWhat matters is people’s age, and more specifically, it’s their biological age\nMulti-morbidity is a risk factor — but all that really means is how old you are, biologically\nThis is not only important for metformin and rapamycin’s relevance, it’s also important for how we are developing vaccines\nNir says the vaccines being developed are not considering the older host \nThe New York Times reported that many vaccines aren’t being tested in people over the age of 65\n\n“I think the vaccine is going to be such a trap. And the way to go over that is either realizing how to do it with the biology of aging. . .or the elderly have to be on metformin or a rapalog in order to get their immunity going. I think this is the next disaster. If we have a vaccine that doesn’t protect the elderly, we did nothing.” —Nir Barzilai\nAnother vaccine concern—Is long-term immunity even possible?\n\nIt’s common to have only a year or less of immunity to other versions of coronavirus after being infected\nSo there’s a legitimate concern that a vaccine for COVID-19 will not be enough to create herd immunity in the long run \n“The probability then that a vaccine is going to provide lifelong immunity the way we get it from several of our most famous vaccines, seems quite low.” says Peter\nNow we have a fifth coronavirus that’s here to stay, but unlike its other four cousins, this one can really whack you\nWe NEED a better strategy around immune enhancement and immune-targeted therapies for the most immune-vulnerable (e.g., monoclonal antibodies)\n\n⇒ See Link to episode of The Drive with David Watkins for more on monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine strategies for COVID-19\nA new awareness on the importance of immune enhancement\n\nJoan says the one positive from the COVID-19 pandemic is that it’s created an awareness that immune enhancement is an important issue\nPrior to this pandemic, nobody really cared about respiratory tract infections, they cared about cancer and other rare diseases\nBut not Joan says there’s “bandwidth” to see if they can figure out the efficacy of rapalogs for immune enhancement to stop things like severe infections to COVID-19\n\n \nThe potential role of rapalogs and metformin in neurodegenerative disease [1:14:30]\nParkinson’s disease and rapamycin\n\nFor Parkinson’s disease—and other neurodegenerative diseases—there’s an accumulation of toxic protein aggregates\nIf you enhance autophagy in preclinical models that has benefit\nRapalogs aren’t great at inducing autophagy, but RTB101 at high doses is very good at inducing autophagy although it’s hard to achieve those concentrations in the brain\nBut… if you combine a rapalog with RTB101, you can lower the concentration of RTB101 that’s needed to induce autophagy so you don’t have to get so much across the blood brain barrier \nThat was the logic behind resTORbio’s ongoing trial which is using that combination for Parkinson’s disease\n\n⇒ Matt Kaeberlein wrote a piece explaining the potential to both ameliorate and potentially clean up a lot of the protein aggregation/disaggregation that’s occurring in the central nervous system (CNS)\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13546\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nihms-1028054-f0001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"726\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nihms-1028054-f0001.jpg 726w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nihms-1028054-f0001-242x300.jpg 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" />\nFigure 6. mTOR links aging and AD—The top part of the figure depicts the involvement of mTOR in key processes common to aging. These hallmarks of aging contribute, in different degrees, to an increased risk for AD and other age-associated neurological diseases, as well as cognitive decline during normative aging. Rapamycin and other pharmacological interventions that attenuate mTOR activity may be beneficial for delaying the progression of AD and other age-associated dementias, as well as for preserving brain function in the healthy elderly. Image credit: Kaeberlein and Galvan, 2019\nThe role of metformin in the risk reduction for Alzheimer’s\n\nAnything that normalizes glucose and insulin, as metformin does, is going to have a direct benefit on dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\n\nIs there any direct data that suggests that metformin should be a part of the toolkit to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease?\n\nNot directly, says Nir\nHowever, there are two NIH funded projects that will take a couple of years to look at people with MCI\nOne study looking at MCI and metformin showed decreased deterioration in some of the domains of Alzheimer’s disease\n\nFor the studies that DON’T show improvement, Nir offers these possible explanations—\n\nOne, they’re from China so either it’s not similar mechanisms, or the genetics and environmental interaction somehow\nSecondly, and more likely…\n\nMetformin delays mortality by 20% which therefore means you’ll get more people on metformin living longer\nSo it might just be the number of the people on metformin that have Alzheimer’s increases because they are hanging around longer. \n\n\n*This is why we need clinical studies and not association studies*\n\n \nNir’s TAME trial—primary objectives and latest updates [1:18:00]\nNir on metformin and rapamycin\n\nNir said he decided to focus his research on metformin NOT because it was the “best drug”\nIn fact, he believes rapamycin will a better longevity agent\nBut he chose metformin because his ultimate goal is to advance the field of preventing age-related diseases\nAnd because there was more data about the safety of metformin compared to rapamycin, he felt like it was the better path to advancing the field\n\nUpdate on Nir’s TAME studies\n\nPart of the problem with TAME is that there’s no commercial interest\nMetformin is a very cheap drug (cheaper than a placebo pill)\nSo nobody wants to pay for a Phase 3 study for five years\nThe American Federation of Aging Research (AFAR) is a group of people from a non-profit and non-industry that is supporting TAME\n\nTAME has 3 arms:\n 1—Prevention of age-related disease and mortality\n\nThis is the primary outcome/FDA outcome\nThis will cost about $35 million coming via the AFAR grant\n\n 2—Identifying biomarkers\n\nThey are going to make sure that they know what are the biomarkers for metformin action and for aging\nThis was funded by the NIA in order to take plasma and blood, DNA, and anything they need to be able to do omics and other things and find biomarkers\n\n 3—The geriatric part\n\nHow many hospitalizations? What’s the ADL? The frailty index? Etc. \nThis could be done at the very end looking at the people with metformin vs. without metformin\nThis hasn’t yet been funded\n\nOther aspects of TAME:\n\n3,000-3,500 subjects\n14 trial centers\nThey will also be able to look at immunity enhancement – for the flu vaccine and perhaps the future COVID-19 vaccine in 2021\n\n \nPotential synergistic effect when combining metformin with rapamycin [1:25:45]\nThere’s not a huge amount of mechanistic overlap between metformin and rapalogs, says Peter\nRapalogs—\n\nImpairing synthesis of proteins\nInhibiting SASPs\nSome autophagy (depending on the way that you inhibit and/or the tissue)\n\nMetformin—\n\nMetabolic benefits such as normalizing glucose and insulin\nDecreases oxidative stress \nDecreases inflammation\n\nCould there potentially be a benefit in combining metformin with a rapalog?\n\n“I don’t think we know enough, yet.” says Joan\nHowever, the ITP study that used both did show a large, positive effect on lifespan of mice\nJoan has looked at people who were getting the rapalogs or RTB101 who are on or off metformin, just to see if I could see a difference, but we’re way under powered so she can’t say anything definitive yet\nNeed to understand side effects—\n\nEvery drug that has a biologic effect has a side effect so if you use two drugs that have a biological effect, you’re just going to get more side effects\nWe’ve got to make sure that the benefits are outweighing the risks\n\n\nExample, if both of rapalog and metformin are enhancing autophagy\n\nThat could be synergistic and a good thing\nHowever, if the patient has cancer, we would want to stop autophagy \n\n\n\n⇒ See episode of The Drive with Eileen White for more on cancer and autophagy\n \nWhy Peter stopped taking metformin and started taking rapamycin [1:27:30]\n⇒ Check out Peter’s emails on this topic: Metformin and exercise and Metformin and exercise – déjà vu all over again?\n\nStarted taking metformin 2010\n2,000 mg per day\nExperienced nausea for about 2 months (then no side effects beyond that)\nIn retrospect, he should have started at 500 mg and worked his way up\nWith his patients, Peter typically titrates up the dosing over time: \n\nFor example, 500 mg before bed ⇒ 500 mg BID (twice per day) ⇒ 1,000 mg at night, and so on\n\n\n\nWhy did he stop taking metformin?\n1—Lactate levels\n\nHe stopped after he looked closely at his lactate levels during Zone 2 exercise (and at baseline)\nZone 2 means keeping lactate below 2.0 millimole (basically trying to see how much work you can do under purely aerobic conditions)\nPeter was very surprised at how high my lactate levels were at baseline–about 1.6 millimole\nAfter talking with Iñigo San Millán (previous podcast guest), Peter did self testing and found that the metformin was indeed increasing his lactate levels (which makes sense given it’s a mitochondrial toxin)\nNOTE: Peter’s concern was not at all lactic acidosis—\n\nIt was about his mitochondria being less efficient as someone who is exercising frequently\nIn other words, as someone who is metabolically healthy and maximizing the dose of exercise, it did not seem like there was any additional benefit that comes from metformin\n\n\n\n2—After reading about the results from the MASTERS trial (Peter summarizes the takeaways from this trial here)\n\nThis trial looked at the effects of metformin on the response to progressive resistance training (PRT) in relatively healthy seniors age 65 and older\nWhile all the subjects had an increase in muscle mass following a 14 week exercise intervention, the group on metformin had less gains\nThis suggests that metformin might be blunting hypertrophy (muscle mass growth) \nIn Peter’s article, he speculates the reason for this: “The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of metformin are disrupting the body’s adaptive response to the pro-inflammatory and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-promoting effects and the biological signals they elicit.”\n\nBut what about muscle strength and function?\n\nNir pushes back on the idea that metformin is “bad” for exercise\nHe points out that while the metformin group had less muscle mass growth, the function was actually the same\nIn other words, the metformin group is doing better work per gram of muscle compared to the placebo group\nNir says the story is different if you look at the transcript data—\n\nMetformin is decreasing mTOR, and exercise is increasing mTOR, so all the mTOR transcripts were higher in the exercise-only group and were blunted by metformin\nPer Nir, 516 of the transcripts were different between them and they were only in the metformin group. \nAnd those were the transcripts that we want to see with aging, such as transcripts for autophagy \n\n\nNir’s main points: \n\nIn this elderly population, metformin kept the young profile of the muscle \nAt the end, maybe you had less muscle, but you had the same function, and you gained by metformin protecting 500 transcripts that are aging transcripts\n\n\n\nPeter says his main question about metformin and exercise is the following: \nIf you are metabolically healthy and you are maximizing the dose of exercise, is there additional benefit that comes from metformin? \nOr is this a drug that is better reserved for people who are not taking the maximum dose of the drug known as exercise?\n\nNir’s answer: There’s an independent [positive] effect of metformin when you’re exercising, at least in people older than 70.\nNir says this is why he is personally taking 1,500 mg per day of metformin and exercising daily\n\nPeter’s experience with taking rapamycin\n\nIn 2011/2012, Peter knew he wanted to start taking rapamycin based on just the data in the mice, yeast, flies, worms, etc. \nHis biggest concern was immune suppression\nAnd it was still unclear as to how to dose it\nBut then, Joan’s 2014 paper was published giving him more confidence that it was safe\nJoan’s paper suggested 5 mg once a week was a pretty good place to start\nPeter triangulated that data with data from Matt Kaeberlein’s dogs \nHe settled on 6 mg once a week \nWhat still remains unclear for Peter is how to cycle it\n\nCurrent protocol is—on for 8 weeks, off for 5 weeks\n“But, truthfully, without more advanced testing, I’m really making it up and therefore I don’t like talking about it like I just did.”\n\n\nSide effects: \n\nAphthous ulcers, but mostly just at the beginning during an acclimation period\nFingernails grow slower\nOther than those observations, Peter says he doesn’t “feel” anything while taking it\n\n\n\n \nStory from Nir’s book that demonstrates the challenge of doing good scientific studies [1:37:30]\n*The following is a story from Nir’s new book: Age Later: Healthspan, Lifespan and the New Science of Longevity\n\nNir was a reviewer of the single biggest study ever on caloric restriction out of the University of Wisconsin\nIn the study, one group of rhesus monkeys had their calories restricted and compared to control monkeys allowed to eat ad libitum \nThe monkeys were followed for their entire life to see if calorie restriction extended lifespan\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13538\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/calorie-restricted-rhesus-monkeys-1024x859.png\" alt=\"\"

So is reversing a biologic clock going to mean you’re in a better state or not?”\nPeter adds,\n\nLet’s just say a person shows up at time T-naught, and they have methylation status M-naught\nYou then apply an intervention that is beneficial (rapamycin, metformin, etc.)\nFast forward to another time point—even if you have not undone methylation, how do you know you haven’t done good that is proactive as opposed to retroactive?\n\nNir says, \n“It’s one thing to have a biomarker that predicts biological age, but we want much more than that. We want biomarkers to predict if we’re targeting aging.”\nPatient case study:\n\nPeter’s patient used a clock that predicted his biological age to be 34 (younger than his chronological age)\nBut after a 5-day water only fast, the same biologic clock said his age was 27\nTo get 7 years younger in 5 days seems nonsensical—”You can reverse engineer these things in any way you want, actually.”\n\n“Every time I’ve looked at one of these, I have found the data to be somewhat unhelpful because I don’t know what to make of them.” —Peter Attia\nNir has a Nature Medicine paper with Tony Wyss-Coray doing a clock from proteomic viewpoint \n-Took thousands of patients between the age 65 and 95 and looked at proteins and asked: What does change between age 65 and 95?\n\nThe most important thing about the proteins was that there were a bunch of breakdowns in collagen, granular sites of platelets, etc.\nNir says he came to realize that these breakdowns are important biomarkers because what we’re going to do when “treating aging” (with metformin, rapamycin, etc.) is stop the breakdown that is typical to aging. \nProteomics are much more reactive than methylation, says Nir\n\nPeter’s overall thoughts on methylation and epigenetic clocks: “To me, the really interesting stuff is that the metabolomic, proteomic, transcriptomic level, of which maybe methylation becomes an additional thing that matters. But I think I just struggle with any one of these things being a magic bullet.”\nNir’s take:\n\nNir points out that there was a Cell paper where it was attempted to rejuvenate the thymus with growth hormone, metformin, and DHE\nThey showed methylation reversal\nSo, it’s not that methylation can’t be reversed or that it doesn’t matter, says Nir, but he is more interested in the other “omics” in the same way Peter is\n\nProteomic data and aging:\n\nJoan points out a limitation with looking at proteins:\n\nAt Novartis, they did some looking at proteomics and aging\nThe problem, says Joan, is that some of the proteins (e.g., GDF15) that go up with age are sometimes actually [a good thing] (as shown in the Framingham Heart Study)\nIn other words, moving the proteome to a younger age can sometimes actually be bad clinically\n\n\n\nTwo more things about the proteomic data from Nir’s Nature Medicine paper:\n\n1—Children of centenarians have about ⅓ of the proteome of people who are typically aging so there is some relationship to longevity \n2—the proteome of females is much more stable\n\nIn men there are ~560 proteins that are changing\nIn women, there are only ~200 that are changing\nNir’s suspects the rate of aging in women is actually different — but unclear as to why\n\n\n\nStudying centenarians\nThe “superpower” of centenarians: Their superpower is NOT that they survive better when they get diseases, it’s just that they phase shift when those diseases hit them—When they’re 80, they’re just acting like physiologically 60 year olds.\n\nTheir aging has been delayed enough to prevent major age related diseases, but it’s not that they didn’t age\nThey have a compression of morbidity—Towards the end of their life they are frail enough so that whatever disease they get, it kills them and it does so quickly\nSo rather than look at their genes and biomarkers at the late stage of life, it makes more sense to compare what they looked like at age 80 compared to their 80 year old, non-centenarian peers\n\nNir’s paper showing offspring of centenarians have less heart disease despite no better lifestyle habits of the controls: Effect of Exceptional Parental Longevity and Lifestyle Factors on Prevalence of Cardiovascular Disease in Offspring\n\nThis paper is looking at the offspring of centenarians \nDespite no difference in behaviors and lifestyle, they had 40% of the heart disease of the control suggesting genetics plays a major role in slowing age related disease\n\n \nJoan’s dream experiment to test immune-enhancing effect of RTB101 [1:57:15]\nIf Joan had unlimited funding, what experiment would she do to test the hypothesis of RTB101 with respect to immune function?\n\nPhase 3 trial in an elderly population\nShe would look at lab confirmed respiratory tract infections, including COVID-19, and see if they could reduce the severity of illness\nShe would have 3 groups\n\nRTB101\nA rapalog (Everolimus)\nPlacebo\nNote: she would NOT add the combo of RTB101+rapalog because that didn’t work as well in resTORbio’s phase 2B study\n\n\n\nHow and when would she dose the drug?\n\nThere’s a peak of hospitalizations and deaths in people, particularly 70 and older, right during the 4 months of winter cold and flu season\nShe would give the drug during that period and show that they have decreased hospitalization, and decreased severe symptoms\nJoan’s view is that the most benefit is coming from when the patient is on drug as opposed to post-wash out\n\n \nConcluding thoughts on COVID-19 [1:59:45]\nPeter’s take on what should be the focus—\n\nThe FDA and scientific community needs to adapt and increase their tolerance for risk when studying agents like metformin and rapamycin \n\nPeter says, “I feel less nervous taking rapamycin personally than an antibiotic.”\n\n\nWe clearly need to do to be prepared for future viruses\n\nContact tracing\nStockpile of PCR tests and reagents for PCR\nStockpile of antiviral meds\nAnd we need more immune modulating therapy options\nFor more on preparedness, see episode of The Drive with Stanley Perlman\n\n\nOur goal should be making people more resilient\n\nWe should fund large studies looking at what definitively enhances our immune system\nThings like…\n\nSleep\nVitamin D & C\nMetformin\nRapamycin\nEtc.\n\n\n\n\n\n“My view is that there are agents like metformin and rapamycin that could play a significant role in preparedness. Basically what it really comes down to is resilience. That’s really what you’re talking about, is host resilience.” —Peter Attia\nJoan’s take:\n\nRapalogs may have a double benefit—\n\n1) Low doses would be used to prevent infections and severity of infections\n2) High doses that are immunosuppressive might actually have benefit for that over-reaction of the immune system in response to COVID-19\n\nHere’s a small study out of Hong Kong showing an mTOR inhibitor was beneficial for patients with severe influenza and here’s a clinical trial looking at rapamycin in hospitalized patients with COVID-19\n\n\n\n\nA word of caution: We definitely need more data on drugs like rapamycin and metformin — “I do think these shouldn’t be used until we PROVE that they have benefit.”\n\nNir offers some advice: “I don’t want to see studies that are not clinical studies. That’s my whole schtick here. I think we want, and we need, to find how we do things effectively, as fast as possible, and that it’s still led by science.”\n⇒ See Nir’s webinar comparing the pandemic to a war situation: 2 Be or not 2 Be\nHow we can do better scientifically:\n\nWe can better scrutinize drugs in phase 1 trials before moving to phase 2, says Peter\nWe must be thinking more about structural changes to how we do science (using oncology as the example of how NOT to do it ⇒ see Azra Raza episode of The Drive)\nJoan makes the point that we have to find a way to work within (and with) regulatory authorities and that creates many challenges\n\nResTORbio’s failed phase 3 trial, for example, did not meet its endpoint largely due to what the FDA required\n\n\n\nBetter biomarkers are needed — “Better biomarkers are going to allow for better studies. Bottom line. And right now our biomarkers are so crude as to border on unhelpful at times.”\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialJoan’s company looking at rapalogs and mTOR inhibitors to target aging: resTORbio | (restorbio.com) [1:00]\nNir’s longevity gene projects looking at centenarians: Longevity Genes Project | (einstein.yu.edu) [1:30]\nNir’s LonGenity study on the genetics of longevity by focusing on the offspring of centenarians: LonGenity | (einstein.yu.edu) [1:30]\nNir’s book: Age Later: Healthspan, Lifespan and the New Science of Longevity by Nir Barzilai | (amazon.com) [1:45, 1:35:30]\nNir’s previous appearance on The Drive podcast: #35 – Nir Barzilai, M.D.: How to tame aging | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [3:45]\nPaper by Cynthia Kenyon that influenced Joan to study aging which showed that genetic mutations in worms can cause doubling of lifespan: A C. elegans mutant that lives twice as long as wild type (Kenyon et al., 1993) [5:00]\nPharma company that Joan worked at prior to resTORbio where she ran trials using rapalogs: Novartis | (novartis.com) [5:45]\nData that mTOR inhibitors have beneficial effects on aging and lifespan in every organism tested: Rapamycin: An InhibiTOR of Aging Emerges From the Soil of Easter Island (Arriola Apelo and Lamming, 2016) [7:00, 10:15]\nJoan’s 2014 study showing a rapalog enhanced the immune response to the flu vaccine system in older adults: mTOR inhibition improves immune function in the elderly (Mannick et al., 2014) [7:00, 11:15, 34:15, 38:25, 59:30, 1:02:45, 1:35:15] \nLloyd Klickstein episode discussing rapamycin and mTOR inhibition: #118 – Lloyd Klickstein, M.D., Ph.D.: Rapamycin, mTOR inhibition, and the biology of aging | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [13:25, 1:35:00]\nNir’s study was the first to show that metformin specifically targets hepatic glucose production aka the insulin sensitivity of the liver much more so than the muscle: Mechanism of metformin action in obese and lean noninsulin-dependent diabetic subjects (DeFronzo et al., 1991) [16:00, 1:33:00]\nThe DPP studies show that metformin will prevent people from developing diabetes: The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (Diabetes Care, 2002) [16:45]\nA metformin paper Nir says was the “turning point” for him which showed that people on metformin had less cardiovascular events and less mortality when compared to control patients: Can people with type 2 diabetes live longer than those without?
