Iñigo provides a masterclass into the many different energy system pathways, the various fuel sources (including the misunderstood lactate), the six zones of exercise training, and the parameters he uses to measure metabolic health. Additionally, he highlights the power of zone 2 training in its ability to act as a powerful diagnostic tool, and perhaps more importantly as a treatment for mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#85 - Iñigo San

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations? [35:00]; What makes the human brain different than all other species? [44:15]; Imprinting stress to your kids epigenetically [48:00]; The role of stress on memory and the consequences of hypercortisolemia [53:00]; The impact of subjective socioeconomic status and social media on stress levels and health [57:45]; Tips for managing stress in the modern world [1:13:15]; What Robert learned about himself studying the social behavior of baboons [1:25:30]; The multilayered factors behind every human behavior, the context of “good and bad”, and exploring the human capacity of the wild extremes of violence and altruism from moment to moment [1:30:15]; PMS: How two women with identical hormone levels can have completely different emotional experiences [1:34:45]; How much of a role do genes play in depression and other emotional states? [1:38:00]; Why is cortisol elevated under sleep deprivation?

We tend to believe that any hard effort is anaerobic, and therefore the concept of anaerobic threshold. But actually, even what we call the anaerobic threshold is aerobic activity. The majority of the efforts that we do are in an aerobic environment except for when you do a sprint…or a one minute maximal.” – Iñigo San Millán, Ph.D.\nMuscle Fiber Type\n\nDepending on the energy system (training zone) different muscle fibers are recruited \n\n“Slow” and “fast” twitch fibers require different force \nThe speed refers to how quickly the fibers fatigue \n\n\nType I muscle fibers are used during low intensity exercises \n\nDon’t need to contract as forcefully \nHave a high oxidative and low glycolytic capacity\n\n\nSpeed refers to how quickly they fatigue\ntype 2 fiber divided into 2A and 2B\n\nIIA have high oxidative and  glycolytic capacity and fatigue relatively slowly \nIIB have low oxidative and high glycolytic capacity and fatigue quickly (recruited for anaerobic sprint – short time duration under stress)\n\n\nFatigue faster because metabolically more stressed \n\nCellular Fuels\n\nMain fuels: fatty acids and glucose \nFatty acids are the cellular fuel source for lower intensity activities\n\n“It’s about ATP generation, that’s exercise intensity. So, at low exercise intensities, those slow twitch muscle fibers, or type 1 muscle fibers, are very well designed to use an energy that is good enough to provide ATP. And yet, you can do this for a very long time. And that’s the diesel gasoline, and that is the fatty acids.” – Iñigo San Millán, Ph.D.\n\nAs energy demand increases at higher intensity, glucose is used as fuel\nGlucose is a faster energy system\n\n“However, as exercise intensity increases, the necessity to produce ATP at a higher rate increases as well. And it gets to a point where fatty acids alone are not enough to produce ATP. Therefore, you need another energy system. And that energy system is glucose, which is a faster energy system. ” – Iñigo San Millán, Ph.D.\n⇒ Car analogy: When driving on flat roads, the car will use diesel gas (fatty acids for the muscles) because it’s more efficient and economical because you get more miles per gallon. If you’re driving through the mountains you’ll need more acceleration so you’ll use the regular gasoline (glucose for the muscles)\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11374\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-1-inigo-1024x800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-1-inigo-1024x800.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-1-inigo-300x234.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-1-inigo-768x600.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-1-inigo-1536x1200.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-1-inigo.png 1538w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 1. Mitochondria metabolism. Mitochondria substrate utilization involves both fatty acids and glucose, undergoing either glycolysis or beta-oxidation to produce ATP. In the second stage of aerobic oxidation, pyruvate formed in glycolysis and transported into mitochondria, where it is oxidized by O2 to CO2. These mitochondrial oxidation reactions generate 34 of the 36 ATP molecules produced from the conversion of glucose to CO2. Image credit: (San Millán, 2015)\n\nWhether activity demand qualifies as aerobic or anaerobic comes down to the speed with which the muscle is demanding ATP\nAerobic means ATP demand is slow enough that it can be met through mitochondrial oxidation of fuel sources (fatty acids) \nAnaerobic energy demands exceed the capacity of mitochondria oxidation\n\nFuel source comes from stored ATP in the muscle itself – not requiring any energy systems\n\n\n\n“when the ATP demands even exceed the cytosolic production of ATP, that’s when you need to use the ATP that is already stored in the muscle. You just don’t have time to synthesize it. You need to use it. And that’s why the body stores very, very minimal amounts of ATP. And that’s what you use in a sprint. But you need to resynthesize it very fast. That’s the pure anaerobic. You don’t need any energy systems.” – Iñigo San Millán, Ph.D.\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11375\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-2-inigo-1024x807.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"807\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-2-inigo-1024x807.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-2-inigo-300x236.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-2-inigo-768x605.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-2-inigo.png 1196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 2.

Therefore, by measuring the fat oxidation of these patients, we can indirectly see the mitochondrial function, especially when we put them in context or in comparison with those ones who are healthy individuals.”  – Iñigo San Millán, Ph.D.\n\nThe paper [essentially] proposes a functional definition of FatOx threshold capacity for the different study groups\nZone 2 threshold becomes a way to assess mitochondrial function, thereby providing opportunity to clinically assess a patient and better understand their health \n\n \nAssessing mitochondrial function by looking at one’s ability to utilize fat as fuel (with an RQ test) [55:00]\nUsing baseline respiratory quotient (RQ)\n\nRQ is the ratio of produced carbon dioxide to consumed oxygen – measured with blood \nAnother measure of the metabolic fuel the body uses is  the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) – measured with breath\nAt rest, normal metabolism does not produce a lot of CO2 so the ratio remains below ~0.7 (CO2 divided by oxygen)\nRatio is dependent on FatOx at the time of measure\n\nFATox rate during exercise provide an indirect method to assess metabolic flexibility and oxidative capacity across individuals of  different metabolic capabilities\n\nThe recent study assessing metabolic flexibility in the three populations measured RER to determine how much fat was oxidized under a given exertion of effort \nFATox ability was significantly higher in professional athletes compared to patients with metabolic syndrome\nWhen 100% of the fuel source is glucose (marked by RER of 1.00) the individual is in zone 4\n\nNot oxidizing any fatty acid as a fuel source\nHigh RER at a low workload (or at rest) is a red flag for mitochondrial dysfunction \n\n\nFATox negatively correlates with blood lactate (less lactate produced at lower energy outputs, when fatty acids are predominantly utilized as the cellular fuel source)\nAs exercise intensity increases, our ability to oxidize fat efficiently decreases and we rely more on glucose\nPeople who are not metabolically flexible, rely on glucose earlier on in this process\nMetabolically sick people may have an RQ 0.9+ while at rest\n\nRQ of 1.0 means burning 100% glucose (Zone 4)\n\n\nAs a cardiologist would use an electrocardiogram (EKG) to evaluate cardiac function at rest vs. under stress, the study takes the same approach by measuring FATox\n\n“We want to see the same thing that is done usually at the EKG level. So when a cardiologist wants to study the heart, if there’s any abnormality, resting EKG has a reliability of about 50%. So you could see some red flags already, but you don’t see everything…And you stress the heart and similar protocol than what we did here, and that’s what do you do when you EKG in stress, right? Situations derail abilities are by 95%, 97%. So you see a lot of things. So I decided to take the same approach and say, okay, now at rest, as you very well said, you see people in the 90s with RQ, and that’s a red flag. Now, okay, let’s trace those mitochondria.” – Iñigo San Millán, Ph.D.\n \nAthletes vs. metabolically ill patients—mitochondria, fat oxidation, muscle glycogen capacity, “fat droplets”, and more [1:00:00]\n“You can categorize people by looking at the fat and also looking at the lactate. If you burn very little fat, that means that you don’t have a good mitochondrial function. . .If you produce a lot of lactate, that means that you don’t have a good mitochondrial function either, because lactate is metabolized in the mitochondria.” – Iñigo  San Millán, Ph.D.\n\nPeople with metabolic syndrome (MtS) – such as type 2 diabetes – often have coupled pre-type 2 cardiovascular disease\nCardiometabolic Disease represents a coupling of different risk markers  \n80% of people with diabetes have cardiovascular disease and vice versa\n\nIn Iñigo’s 2018 study, he found there to be a strong correlation between the lactate curve and the fat burning curve which tells him that it’s a valid indirect test to see the mitochondria function\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11367\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-9-inigo-707x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"707\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-9-inigo-707x1024.png 707w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-9-inigo-207x300.png 207w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-9-inigo-768x1112.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-9-inigo-1061x1536.png 1061w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-9-inigo.png 1072w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px\" />\nFigure 9.

Therefore, that means that the mitochondria is where you see the biggest improvement. We also see the biggest improvement in performance.” – Iñigo  San Millán, Ph.D.\n\nElite athletes exercise at low intensities that would be high for anyone else as their mitochondrial density is so high and efficient (their recruitment of type 1 muscle fibers)\nAdditionally, the cell efficiently reuses the lactate and keeps it confined to the muscle as fuel for adjacent fibers\nThey generally produce more lactate and utilize it more efficiently as fuel in the cell\nMtS patients utilize more glucose for energy, which may be converted in the cytosol rather than in the mitochondria \nFavoring glucose is a phenotype of metabolic reprogramming seen in MtS patients\nCannot synthesize fatty acids for energy purposes very efficiently so they rely on glucose at rest\nNormally, glucose at rest is oxidized in the mitochondria, but mitochondria don’t function well so cells rely on cytosolic production of ATP  \nThe  blood lactate levels in MtS patients at lower intensities implies that they predominantly rely on cytosolic ATP production, with intermediary pyruvate and lactate endpoint\n\nEnergy storage capacity comparison between elite athletes and metabolic syndrome (MtS) patients\nFitter individuals can store more glycogen than MtS patients…\n\nJohn Hill and Millán developed a methodology to indirectly and noninvasively look at glycogen content, using high-frequency ultrasound \nDavid Nieman – another researcher – saw correlations in his own research, validating the system\n\n\nThe fitter you are, the more glycogen you store \n\nLess dependent on glycogen \nHowever, it is the energy you need to mobilize quickly when required \n\n\n\nBoth populations also have cellular intramuscular triglycerides (IMTGs)\n\nAs opposed to cellular glucose utilization, both elite athletes and individuals with metabolic disease have fat droplets (IMTGs) \nBiopsy shows that fittest and least fit individuals have muscular fat\nIMTGs are highly related to cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes; insulin resistance\nEndurance-trained athletes – who possess a high oxidative capacity and enhanced insulin sensitivity – also have higher intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content\nThe athletes’ paradox \n\n\nNormal individuals (neither an elite athlete nor a patient with metabolic disease) don’t have IMTG reservoir \n\nIñigo does not yet understand why\nHypothesizes that under normal physiologic exertion day-to-day (not elite athlete) the mutation is not necessary\nFat droplets build up for MtS patients as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction whereby fatty acids build up outside of the mitochondria\n\n\n\nThe difference between IMLDs in elites and MTs patients is flux\n\nUnder the most metabolically flexible and the least metabolically flexible conditions, there is the same pattern: higher free fatty acids. But it comes down to flux (utilization)\nIñigo hypothesizes that diabetic individuals retain IMLDs that are not utilized \nFatty acids cannot be transported into the mitochondria and they build up outside the mitochondria \nIn diabetic blood test screening, there is high free fatty acid blood level \nConversely, about 25%-35% of all the fat oxidation an elite athlete undergoes during exercise comes from the fat droplet reservoir: it is very active (high rate of flux)\n\n“So, what it was found that in people with type 2 diabetes, that fat is not active. In fact, it can produce ceramides and other pre-inflammatory mediators that are not only involved with insulin resistance, but maybe with cardiovascular disease or atherosclerosis. They cannot be oxidized in the mitochondria, so they build up outside.” – Iñigo  San Millán, Ph.D.\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11380\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-10-inigo-1024x596.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-10-inigo-1024x596.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-10-inigo-300x175.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-10-inigo-768x447.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-10-inigo.png 1498w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 10.

They had a very low maximal lactate levels and very low maximal heart rate.” – Iñigo  San Millán, Ph.D.\n\nIñigo emphasizes the importance of carbohydrates (CHO) in athletics\nHe observes that when an athlete is fatigued, tired, restricting carbohydrates in a maximal physiologic state, they have very low lactate levels and heart rate\nWith fatigue (whether due to exhaustion and/or diet) power output decreases along with a decrease in lactate and heart rate \nEven though a normal athletes Fatox increases after one to two weeks of CHO restriction, their power output decreases \n\n“We see that the power output decreases at least 0.5 watts per kilogram, so about 30 or 40 watts. Also, we see that the maximum one heart rate decreases, and the maximum lactate decreases” – Iñigo  San Millán, Ph.D.\nKetogenic diets\n\nPeter observed in himself that when he was in ketosis, he could perform other than when he needed to sprint; he didn’t have glycolytic capacity \nIñigo has never had an elite cyclist athlete adapt to be ketosis\n\n (That said, he believes it may be possible to adapt given how many anecdotes are out there from people)\n\n\nAlthough ketosis may allow the body to be more metabolically flexible (with carbohydrate consumption) long term, elite athletes cannot afford to wait for adaptation (takes months to years)\nIñigo sees that athletes that attempt ketogenic diets or carbohydrate restriction while training for an event fail \nShort term, rather than preserve protein under periods of nutrient deprivation (carbohydrate restriction for elite athletes), protein breakdown occurs\nCyclists (even in endurance races) need a huge amount of carbohydrates because of the catabolic activity \n\n“…the thing that I haven’t seen that adaptations in elite athletes cannot afford it [waiting for ketogenic adaptations]. You mentioned that it takes months to get there. You don’t have months, because you get trapped in the races. Your performance is very poor. Your contract is going to be trashed. They’re not going to renew you, and you’re going to feel like crap… Every single athlete who has tried to go, whether you call it a ketogenic diet or a carbohydrate restriction while training in competing for an event, they fail.” – Iñigo  San Millán, Ph.D.\n \nRelationship between exercise and insulin sensitivity (and what we can learn from studying patients with type 1 diabetes) [1:46:30]\n“These athletes have the highest insulin sensitivity of any humans. There’s no insulin resistance, because first, we know very well that exercise increases insulin sensitivity, and they need it to utilize carbohydrates. Eating increases insulin sensitivity, as well, and the transporters” – Iñigo  San Millán, Ph.D.\n\nElite athletes are very insulin sensitive \n\nExercise increases insulin sensitivity\nThey need to utilize carbohydrates; eating increases insulin sensitivity \n\n\nHigh mitochondrial efficiency \n\nIncreases insulin sensitivity \nIncreases non-insulin dependent glucose uptake \n\n\nThere is no better way to stimulate glucose deposition into the muscle than via zone 2 training – clinically seen in type 1 diabete patients\nWorking with Team Novo Nordisk \n\nall of the professional cyclists are type 1 diabetics\n Iñigo can study the metabolic effects of exercise \nWith his insights, he can provide a framework of recommendations for patients who exercise and have MtS\n\n\n\nChallenge of exercising with diabetes:\n\nMtS patients are told to exercise but blood glucose alters with exercise \nPatients become hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic and need to correct with insulin but exercise response is variable\nAs a result, many decide not to exercise\n\n“The problem is that they [MtS patients] go to exercise, and they become hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic, and they need to correct it…the hormonal system goes all over the map, and they go back to their doctors and they have no answers. So it’s the number one barrier that they find from exercise, and many decide not to exercise, because they can’t control their doses very well at home.” – Iñigo  San Millán, Ph.D.\n–Understanding metabolic insulin usage rather than correcting with insulin\n\nExercise increases insulin sensitivity so a patient will not need as much \nIñigo has observed that type 1 diabetics (via Novo Nordisk athletes) are\n\n even more insulin sensitive\nHave 25% higher glycogen content before the race \nHave ~3x less carbohydrate requirement than non-diabetics\nThey likely have higher glycogen content because insulin drives glycogen synthesis\n\n\n\n–Glucose uptake via non-insulin dependent pathways: A case for improving mitochondrial efficiency\n\nHigh intensity exercise increases blood glucose because of hepatic glucose output (gluconeogenesis) \nThe professional team had very high levels of non-insulin dependent glucose uptake by the skeletal muscle\nInsulin initiates the cascade of events that translocate the transporters of insulin, called the GLUT4s, to the surface of the muscle.\nThe implied hope is that the more work on mitochondrial efficiency (via zone 2 training), the more non-insulin dependent pathways will be utilized \n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11383\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-12-inigo-1024x550.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-12-inigo-1024x550.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-12-inigo-300x161.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-12-inigo-768x412.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-12-inigo-1536x825.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-12-inigo.png 1810w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 12.

And that’s why I believe this is happening. First, you have a very high adrenergic activity, high intensity, a lot of adrenaline, and that’s what causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, as well as their glucose export from the liver..when exercise stops the muscle contraction – which initiates glucose reuptake – stops completely, resulting in hyperglycemia” – Iñigo  San Millán, Ph.D.\n \nMetformin’s impact on mitochondrial function, lactate production, and how this affects the benefits of exercise [2:04:15]\n\nPeter has long taken Metformin but realized about a year ago that his zone 2 resulted in high lactate levels \n\nHe refers to his observation in a blog post here \nStudies have suggested that Metformin blunts the benefits of exercise\nSupports that Metformin decreases mitochondrial function\n\n\nAlthough the mechanism is not clear, one side effect of Metformin is lactic acidosis\n\nCould be because it increases glucose flux into the cell and saturates pyruvate dehydrogenase such that it has a low Michaelis Constant and more pyruvate is converted to lactate in the pathway\nCould also be that mitochondrial decrease in overall function via inhibition of Complex II\n\n\n\n“It could be both. What we know epidemiologically speaking is that Metformin doesn’t cure diabetes. In the immense majority of patients, they end up using insulin down the road. So we know that Metformin is not that magical drug for type 1I diabetics. It just kind of gets them by. Tt buys them time, but eventually, the majority use insulin. If they don’t change their lifestyle, their nutrition, exercise…” – Iñigo  San Millán, Ph.D.\n\nHigh lactate levels, has been shown to push cells into apoptosis\nPeter hypothesizes that the more healthy you are, the less helpful taking Metformin could be and could cease to be healthy \n\n \nRaising awareness for risk of “double diabetes” [2:15:00]\n\nMany people who have type 1 diabetes may also have type 1I\n50% of U.S. adults have either diabetes or prediabetes (~40% is pre- type 2 diabetic)\nType 1  and type 2 diabetes are very different metabolic diseases and require different treatment \n\nOne commonality is high blood glucose as a potential consequence \nNovo Nordisk told Iñigo that about 75% of inulin sold in the US is for type 2 diabetics but not for type 1 diabetic treatment \nExercise for type 1I diabetes will eliminate insulin requirement\n\n\nNutrition and exercise are the best ways to address diabetes risk\n\nPotential implication of taking statins on metabolic health \n\n5-10% of people experience muscle symptoms on statins\nAdministration impacts mitochondrial function \nIncrease possibility of becoming diabetic (~4% risk)\n\n \nHow to dose zone 2 training, and balancing exercise with nutrition [2:18:00]\nWhat is the right dose of zone 2 exercise? \n\nTwo days a week of zone 2 exercise in elite athletes for many hours maintain fitness \nFor diabetics, Iñigo thinks 3x a week for an hour at a time is enough to be beneficial \nHe had a clinical case who reversed late prediabetes with 90 minutes of exercise 4x a week\n\nInigo’s weight loss\n\nAfter his cycling career, Inigo put on about 65 lbs\nHe then dropped all the weight by implementing about 6 hours per week of zone 2 training\nHe relied heavily on exercise, and less so on nutrition, to lose the weight\nFor Inigo, he was not willing to make too many sacrifices to his diet other than eating a little less (his culture is around food, pasta, bread, chocolate, wine, etc.)\nPeter points out that Inigo’s training was not about calories, it was about “training your mitochondria to become better at fuel partitioning”\n\nIt’s about fuel partitioning, not just calories\n\nMany people think about burning calories when exercising\nA better way to think about it would be that you’re improving your body’s fuel partitioning\nBurning fat trains the cell to become better at fuel partitioning with positive implications for cellular longevity \n\nZone 2 training for metabolic health and exercise adherence… \n\nHigh intensity training burns a lot of calories but doesn’t burn fat to the same degree it is burned during zone 2 training \nIn many cases, high intensity is “too hard”\n\nIndividuals that have not exercised in a long time push too hard \nMay decrease long term adherence/commitment \n\n\n\nInigo on training above zone 2:\n“Number one, you don’t burn much fat. You burn fat in the post exercise because you might increase your metabolic rate, but can that override the fat burning from the exercise itself?…\n…And second, it’s too hard. You haven’t exercised in a long time to start with and you get into this high intensity programs. They may not suit you or they might injure you and many people give up…\n…We see the rate of people giving up from gyms is about 50% or so within X amount of months. They either give up or their adherence decreases a lot.”\nNutrition\n\nExercise is important for MtS patients but nutrition is also critical \nInigo emphasizes that a metabolically ill individual must do both exercise and nutrition and to find the right balance because you need both\nIt’s like the 2 most important levers to pull, and finding your right balance is the key\nPeter adds that this is why he loves fasting, he calls his 7 days fasts once a quarter like his “sprint”\n\n“And to the point of the nutrition; the nutrition is a must. You need to do something with it or do a lot more exercise, but I think it’s the balance that we all, I think, need to understand better.”  – Iñigo San Millán, Ph.D.\n \nProposed explanation of the Warburg Effect: Role of lactate in carcinogenesis [2:27:00]\n\n In type 2 diabetes, the mitochondria are not well-functioning \nThere is an observed higher blood lactate, which is a commonality with cancer patients\n\nHistorical theories of cancer cell metabolic behavior…\n\nCancer cells use glucose for energy  even in the presence of sufficient cellular oxygen \nWarburg concluded that cancer is a metabolic disease caused by an injury of the cellular respiration system (i.e., mitochondria)\nMeyerhof, under Warburg, discovered glycolysis which was measured prior to discovery via lactate produced by the cell\nObserved that cancer cells have a very high lactate production\n\nThree possible explanations for the role of lactate in cancer metabolism…\n\nDysfunctional mitochondria (Warburg)\nGlycolysis and lactate production is a byproduct of metabolic demand via rate of cell growth (put forth by Craig Thomson, Lewis Cantley, and Mathew Vander Heiden in their 2009 paper)\nCancer relies on lactate as a signalling molecule (Millán and Brooks aforementioned study awaiting publication)\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11384\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-13-inigo-741x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"741\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-13-inigo-741x1024.jpeg 741w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-13-inigo-217x300.jpeg 217w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-13-inigo-768x1061.jpeg 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-13-inigo-1111x1536.jpeg 1111w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fig-13-inigo-1482x2048.jpeg 1482w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px\" />\nFigure 13.

So that’s something that shows that, yeah, cycling, thank goodness, is a very clean sport right now.” – Iñigo San-Millan, Ph.D. \n\nCyclists now want to do well and they train at altitude, which did not happen in the past\nAltitude training is a way to increase oxygen carrying capacity \n\n“Live high, train low”…\n\nAt altitude, glycolytic capacity deteriorates with high exercise intensity \nFor cyclists, this is a problem \nIdeal scenario is to find a balance in exercise type and effort output (difficult in high altitude environment) \nIñigo will construct a hyperoxic environment room, simulating sea level conditions in high altitude environment (Boulder, Colorado training facility) \n\nAllowing athletes to do high intensity efforts with a lower perceived effort, at altitude \nAthletes living at altitude who do high intensity exercise tend to become overtrained\nThey have high oxygen carrying capacity but poor glycolytic capacity \n\n\n\nOn the physical prowess of Miguel Indurain…\n\nIñigo did an internship with Miguel Indurain’s physiologist\n\nHe notably sweat a lot – had an amazing capacity to dissipate heat\nSweating a lot is indicative of a mature, efficient physiology \nMetabolic flexibility marked by sodium retention even with high sweat output\n\n\n\n“He was calm. He was relaxed, he was super intelligent. He could read the game ahead of things. He would never get nervous about anything and he would never doubt about anything which is rare in athletes. I’ve seen athletes getting to the top of the game and falling apart and start crying. There’s the fear to lose, but also the fear to win because when you win, your life changes for the good or for the bad.” – Iñigo San Millán, Ph.D.\nBook recommendation from Inigo:\n\nIñigo notes the confidence and mental fortitude of Greg LeMond and recommend his book \nHe says “it’s the best cycling book I’ve ever read in my life and it’s about how he trained and how he ate and the way he approached cycling”\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialPeter refers to aerobic and anaerobic energy systems in a previous blog post: The interplay of exercise and ketosis – Part II by Peter Attia | (peterattiamd.com) [20:45]\nA book Peter recommends: Endure by Alex Hutchinson | (amazon.com) [39:45]\nOn zone 2 training: Zone 2 Training For Endurance Athletes by  Iñigo San Millán | (trainingpeaks.com) [40:00; 1:46:45]\nIñigo’s presentation on cellular metabolism and application: Sports Performance testing in the Cyclist: where are we in 2015 and how does it apply to the recreational athlete? by  Iñigo San Millán | (ucdenver.edu) [41:15]\nResearch on lactate: [28:45; 34:30; 1:01:00; 2:30:00]\n\nOn lactate shuttle theory: The Science and Translation of Lactate Shuttle Theory (Brooks, 2018)\nTraumatic brain injury patients at UCLA (TBI) suggests that lactate can be used in rehabilitation: Lactate: Brain Fuel in Human Traumatic Brain Injury: A Comparison with Normal Healthy Control Subjects (Glenn et al., 2015) \nLactate stimulates the expression of the major oncogene transcription factors in breast cancer cell cycle genes: Is Lactate an Oncometabolite?
