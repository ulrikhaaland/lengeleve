  "content": "In this episode, infectious disease and pandemic preparedness expert, Amesh Adalja, M.D., puts the current pandemic into context against previous coronaviruses as well as past influenza pandemics. Amesh also provides his interpretation of the evolving metrics which have contributed to big variations in modeling predictions, whether this will be a seasonally recurring virus, and perhaps most importantly—how we can be better prepared for the inevitable future novel virus. Finally, Amesh explains where he sees positive trends which give him reasons for optimism. \nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#106 - Amesh Adalja, M.D.: Comparing COVID-19 to past pandemics, preparing for the future, and reasons for optimism\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#106 - Amesh Adalja, M.D.: Comparing COVID-19 to past pandemics, preparing for the future, and reasons for optimism\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#106 - Amesh Adalja, M.D.: Comparing COVID-19 to past pandemics, preparing for the future, and reasons for optimism\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nAmesh’s background in infectious disease [2:40];\nWhen did the virus actually reach the US?

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

And when did Amesh realize it would pose a real threat to the US? [4:00]\nBack in December…\n\nHe was trying to take what the Chinese were saying at face value\nHowever, the Chinese were originally reporting this to only be animal to human (and not human to human)\nAmesh was skeptical\nEventually a Lancet paper came out which showed someone who got ill had no contact with a wet market suggesting human to human transmission was possible\nThis false reporting by the Chinese gave the virus a “very big headstart” in spreading across the planet\n\nDo you think it’s possible that this virus was in the United States? Potentially even within an individual prior to December 31st?\n\nWon’t rule out the possibility\nMay have been sporadic cases\nBut the data don’t show that there were widespread cases prior to January\n\nAt what point was Amesh becoming convinced that this was going to enter the US in a manner that was going to pose real difficulty for the country?\n\n“I knew it was going to enter the United States almost from the onset.”\nOnce it was clearly possible to transmit human to human (Just like H1N1), it wasn’t going to be containable, says Amesh\n\n–What Amesh did NOT realize was…\n\nHow difficult it would be to contain in the US\nAnd that was because our testing capability wasn’t as good as Amesh assumed\nSecondly, many people had mild to no symptoms so it was hard to know who has it much less do contact tracing \n\n“That became completely unmanageable because we basically were allowing this virus to have about two months of unabated spread in the United States, and that’s something that most of us did not think would happen because we thought that we were much more resilient to these types of infections than we really were.”\n \nComparing and contrasting COVID-19 to previous pandemics like the Asian flu of 1958 and the Spanish flu of 1918 [8:00]\n\nIn 1958, a novel flu virus spread in the US killing about 100,000 people\nThe worst flu season since then was 2017-2018 which killed ~80,000 people\nFlu has a lot of similarities with coronavirus:\nThey both are transmitted through the respiratory route\nThey both have symptoms that include coughing and sneezing and sore throat and muscle aches and pains and fever. \nHowever…\n\nThis is in ADDITION to the flu\nIn the 50s, people were used to the flu so they sort of took it in stride\nIn 2009 with H1N1, it spread like crazy to 61 million people and started to stress the healthcare system but it has a case fatality rate of less than seasonal flu\n\n\n\nAn influenza pandemic still remains the biggest pandemic threat that we face…\n\nSome avian influenza has a CFR of 65%\nFor example, if H7N9 even figured out how to efficiently go human to human we’d be in a MUCH more dire situation\n\nWith COVID-19…\n\nWe are fortunate that COVID-19 CFR is less than 1% (maybe as low at .3%)\n“But we didn’t do that great of a job within, in terms of diagnostic testing and hospital capacity and personal protective equipment. So that’s magnified this and that’s the human factor that’s magnified what the virus could do.”\n\n“I’m a little more worried about our pandemic resiliency based on how badly we’ve handled a 1% case fatality rate, pandemic virus, where you’ve got cascading decisions by governors in States and countries all around the world that really have magnified the damage that the virus has done.”\nIt’s better to think about different cities separately than to just look at the US as a whole…\n\nDepending on density of population\nWhen they began social distancing, etc.\n\n \nWill COVID-19 be a recurring seasonal virus every year? [14:00]\nThere are currently 4 types of coronaviruses that recur seasonally\n\nThey cause about 25% of the colds we get\nThey are quite mild\nAmesh thinks that SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 will be a fifth strain of seasonal coronavirus with “intermediate” severity\n\nWhy are SARS and MERS not seen seasonally?\n\nThey are mostly animal to human\n\nSummarizing why this will likely be recurring seasonally:\n“When you look at their outbreaks, they’re very specialized. They’re happening in healthcare facilities have poor infection control and it doesn’t really sustain itself in the human population. Whereas if you look at the other four coronaviruses, the ones that cause common colds, they are ubiquitous. They transmit very easy. They have a mild spectrum of illness which allows people to go about their daily life and spread, and this new novel coronavirus does appear to be more like them in terms of their transmissibility. So that’s why I think that this will be the fifth seasonal coronavirus until there’s a vaccine.”\n \nWill a future vaccine be specific to this COVID-19 or will it also cover previous coronaviruses as well? [15:15]\n\nProbably not the first vaccine we get\nBut it’s possible that one down the road will cross protect against other types of coronaviruses\n\n \nWhat does Amesh think might be the true case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2? [16:15]\n\nIt’s been hard to calculate because we have a “severity bias”\nSouth Korea and Germany has done more testing so Amesh looks at their data\nGermany just showed it to be 0.37%, for example\nAmesh estimates the true CFR to be between 0.3% to 0.66% range\nBut this is an AVERAGE\nThings like age and underlying conditions make the CFR different\n\n“Some people will have much, much higher risks and some people have lower risks, and I think that’s sometimes lost in nuance when you try to come up with one number.”\n \nWhy did early models over predict infections and deaths by order of millions? [18:30]\n\nSome of the earliest predictions from models suggested 200+ million people would get infected and 2-4 million Americans would die\nThose seems to now look like wild over predictions\n\nWhat contributed to this?\n\nThe models have many assumptions\nEach small adjustment in the assumptions can make a huge impact on the end number\n\n⇒ One example, hospitalization rate\n\nHospitalization rate was probably overstated \nThere clearly is a severity bias in who gets tested… which leads to a number like 15 to 20% getting admitted to the hospital\nAmesh says the real hospitalization rate is probably closer to 5%\n\n“[They were] using the wrong denominator, I think, to come up with what their case fatality ratios are, what their ICU bed needs would be, and what their mechanical ventilation needs would be.”\n \nRole of government—How does Amesh view the role of local versus central government in dealing with a future pandemic? [21:50]\n\nUS government is unique in healthcare where power is vested at the local and state level and the federal government is more of a coordinator\nAmesh is generally supportive of this set up given that local health departments are the ones running it because they actually know their community, they know their capacities, they know where their gaps are, and they’re able to really be on the ground with the people and able to do great things when it comes to stopping an outbreak\nHowever, often they are under resourced during a pandemic\n“What you need to really do is have those local health departments actually operating the way that they should be and thought of as part of the whole pandemic response apparatus. Whereas many people think of just the CDC, the NIH and parts of the health and human services department as the main pandemic apparatus.”\nAmesh says that confusing part for the public is that there were some conflicting recommendation from federal to state to local areas\n\n“I do think that when the process works well with local, state and federal government all in step, all doing the appropriate roles, I do think it works pretty well. You have a locally managed federally coordinated response, which I think is the best way to think about how it would be ideally done.”\n \nWhat went wrong with testing and how could we have utilized it more effectively? [25:15]\n-The CDC put out guidance that was too restrictive as to who could get tested\n\nOriginally that was…\n\nOnly people that had traveled to China in the last 14 days\nHad to have lower respiratory tract symptoms or pneumonia \nWe weren’t testing mild cases and we weren’t testing people that hadn’t come from China\n\n\n\n-A better way to do this would have been…\n\nThis is a respiratory virus and as many overlapping symptoms with common colds and flus\nyou should think about this in your patients and we are going to allow testing to be done if you have certain risk factors for this\nAnd they shouldn’t just be restricted to you having severe disease or having traveled to China\n“That would have changed the way that the general public and clinicians would have thought about this.”\n\n-We also had a scarcity of testing and reagents and nasal swabs\n-AND it was all compounded by bureaucratic hiccups such as the CDC test having to go through FDA emergency use authorization before it could be distributed to the US\n \nFuture pandemic preparedness—why Amesh is cautiously optimistic [27:30]\n\nAmesh thinks that since this pandemic has impacted so many people from a health perspective but perhaps even more so an economic perspective…\n…that this one will not be forgotten\nIn the past, we’ve sort of “reacted” to things like anthrax in 2001, bird flu in 2005, H1N1 in 2009, Ebola in 2013, and then Zika after that\nBut once those were gone it sort of faded\nAmesh is optimistic that the people will now prioritize pandemic preparedness and demand that their politicians take the proper steps\n\n \nShould there be different policies and restrictions for places like New York City compared to less populated and less affected places across the US? [30:15]\nAmesh definitely thinks we should be implementing different strategies across the country\n\nThere are places that can start to think about lessening restrictions \n\nLess social distancing\nOpening up more businesses\nOpening up schools\n\n\n\nDefinitely need to start considering opening up medical centers for non-COVID patients: “In places where they’re not inundated because you’re going to get other health consequences that are not captured by the models which are really measurable and will pay for down the road.”\nAll this will depend on what’s happening locally:\n\nHow much transmission do you have?\nWhat is the antibody status of your population?\nWhat’s your hospital capacity?\nWhat is your ability to do diagnostic testing? \nDo you have the new rapid tests available in many different places? \n“All of that can help condition how we get back to normal.”\n\nUntil we have vaccine… the one place where we need to be the most careful is mass gatherings \n“We can start taking steps and I hope that we start doing it because this cost is something that is measurable and it increases every day and I do think that they’re going to be [other] consequences that are not captured by our models, which are really only focused on coronavirus.”\n \nWhy mass gatherings might be disproportionately driving the spread of the virus [32:30] \n\nGerman data recently suggested that mass gatherings that are disproportionately driving the spread\nA mass gathering brings people from wide geographic areas\nAt an NFL game, for example, people are close to each other and they are screaming and yelling which results in particles coming from their mouths\nWe saw what happened at a choir practice recently \nMass gatherings are going to be a challenge until a vaccine comes out because…\nThe density\nThe fact that people come from different geographic regions and then just disperse\nMass gatherings are a particular problem when it comes to communicable infectious diseases\n\n \nLearning from HKU1, a lesser-known novel coronavirus from 2005 [34:00]\nHong Kong University found a novel coronavirus (HKU1) in 2005\n\nCoronavirus was on their radar because of the 2003 SARS situation\nThey found HKU1 in some people who had pneumonia that tested negative for SARS\nThey then looked in other countries and found it in Cleveland in the proportion of patients that were hospitalized for Coronavirus—HKU1 is disproportionately in patients who died or were on ventilators\n“And it was basically everywhere you looked.”\nIt flew under the radar because we do a poor job of testing for respiratory viruses\nWhile Amesh doesn’t think SARS-CoV-2 was widespread prior to January in the US, he would not be surprised if there were undiagnosed cases that were “hidden” in our cold and flu season as early as December\n\n“I do think that’s an important lesson to think about with a virus that can spread surreptitiously and you don’t know about it because our diagnostic curiosity is so bad for many infectious disease syndromes.”\n \nThoughts on Sweden’s herd immunity approach [36:10]\nSweden has sort of elected to not shut down to the extent that other European and Scandinavian countries have. \nPeter asks, Have you paid attention to the transmissibility in Sweden or do you have any comments on it?\n\nThey’re trying to pursue a herd immunity strategy\nYou’re going to see more cases there, which is what they’re aiming for. \nAmesh is a bit worried because their per capita ICU bed numbers are not very high and that’s what we’re really worried about is…\n\nDo you put an ICU into crisis? \nDo you have problems with ventilators? \n\n\nAmesh says it will be instructive to learn how they do but thinks it will be a challenge to sort of cocoon the high-risk people\n\n“It’s all going to depend upon who is getting sick and how well they can sequester their high risk groups, which I think is very daunting and challenging.”\n \nThe efficacy of masks being worn in public and what role they will play as restrictions are slowly lifted [37:20]\nThis is a controversial topic, says Amesh, but he does NOT believe masks are very helpful to the public\n“I tend to be someone who’s not supportive of masks being worn by the public and especially not n95 masks, which I think are in short supply, unclear whether the public can actually bear wearing them for a long period of time because they’re not comfortable to wear.”\nFor those with clear symptoms (e.g., coughing/sneezing)…\n\nThey should definitely wear a mask in public\n\nThe question is…For people who are asymptomatic (having no symptoms), how transmissible are they if they don’t wear a mask?\n\nThis is an open question, says Amesh\nThe CDC made a recommendation to wear homemade masks\nHowever, Amesh is not sure not sure how well those homemade masks prevent you from spreading it even if you ARE someone with symptoms because they don’t even stop the coughs and sneezes very well based on some studies that have been published.\n\nSummary of Amesh’s take on the public wearing masks:\n“I’m someone who doesn’t necessarily think that these masks are going to be very beneficial and they could be paradoxically negative because people may then refrain from washing their hands as much. They may not social distance as much, they may contaminate other people with their mask if they don’t store it properly or wash it…\n…So I have a lot of concerns about mass, but I think that this is a, a decision that’s going to be made on a political basis and there is enough scientific controversy that I think politicians may use it as a way to move forward in a way that allows us to open schools, open businesses up if they have people wearing masks. But I’m not sure if we’ll get much benefit from them.”\n \nWhat are some positive trends and signs of optimism? [39:15]\nMost optimistic about…\n\nPlateauing numbers in New York, Seattle, California. \nCalifornia, for example, is taking ventilators and giving them to other states\nWashington State is dismantling their field hospital that did not see any patients and returning ventilators\n\n–We hear a lot about the bad places like New York, New Orleans, Chicago, Detroit…\n\nBut there are places that were preparing for a surge are now downsizing their nursing staff \nMany field hospitals are closing down\nMany ventilators are going back to the national stockpile\nIt’s important to know that it’s not going to be doom and gloom and every place\n\n“All of that makes me very optimistic that we will be able to meet the challenge of this virus without putting any of our hospitals into crisis, that this is going to be a severe challenge for this country, but it’s not something that that is going to break the country.”\n§<img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bio-pic-amesh-500x500.png\" class=\"section--guest__image img--circle alignright\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bio-pic-amesh-500x500.png 500w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bio-pic-amesh-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" />Amesh Adalja, M.D.Dr. Adalja is a Senior Scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.
