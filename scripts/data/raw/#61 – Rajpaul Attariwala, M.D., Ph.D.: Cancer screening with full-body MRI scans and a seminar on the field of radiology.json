  "content": "In this episode, radiologist/engineer, Raj Attariwala, explains how he was able to apply his engineering background to create a unique MRI scanner that is capable of constructing whole-body images with a resolution that is unmatched in the industry. Peter and Raj discuss the implications of such a robust, radiation-free imaging tool on the early detection of cancer. They dive deep into cancer screening and define terms such as sensitivity and specificity that are necessary to really understand this complex space. They then describe the biggest risks involved in this type of screening (false positives) and how Raj’s unique technology and process might drive down this risk substantially. But before that, they discuss all the common imaging technology from X-ray, to CT scan, to PET scans, to ultrasound, to MRI, and more. They touch on the history of each, how they work, the usefulness and limitations of each of them, as well as the varying risks involved such as radiation exposure.

Peter going into Raj’s Prenuvo MRI machine.\nRaj’s business\n\nAIM Medical Imaging is a private scanning company which Raj started to be able to “play” with his MRI technology\nHis clinic is called Prenuvo which was started in order to “put the power of preventive medicine into a patient’s hands”\n\nRaj’s road to radiology\n\nRaj got a chemical engineering degree\nduring that period of time I realized that I actually like the body and physiology and how that works\nThen decided to get a master’s and PhD in biomedical engineering at Northwestern\nDuring that time, he and his team built a robot that could do keyhole surgery in the eye that wound up attracting a lot of attention from physicians from top-tier universities\nThe desire to be able to speak the language of doctors, Raj decided to go to medical school\n\nMed school\n\n“Hated every minute of it”\nRaj likes answers to questions and soon realized that there’s a lot of things in the body, and physiology, and pathophysiology that we just don’t fully understand\n\n“What I would actually start to boil it down to is that I would actually go back to my engineering pathophysiology texts, and I would actually read them and talk to the PhD guys, and they would actually give me the theories on what they thought was happening. When you actually got that theory, it was almost like planting a seed, and then you actually understood how the entire tree would look.”\nTechnology in medicine\n\nRaj’s first love was technology so he decided to put those things together \nWorked on some of the very first surgical robotic machines ever built\nBut in that process, Raj realized that the best place to focus on technology in medicine was radiology (imaging technology)\n\nRadiology \n\nStarted in an area called nuclear medicine, which is a small specialty within radiology where you’re actually looking at functional imaging, how things work, how do things change, what happens over time\nReally liked nuclear medicine because it was showing you what’s happening when things are normal and then when things become abnormal (Raj particularly loved how the answer was black and white which is rare in medicine)\n\nAnalogy\n\nRadiology is like anatomy, a blueprint… where you actually see what’s going on, you actually see the changes, and you see the shapes of things, and you use that very much as a blueprint for a building to actually see what it does\nWhereas nuclear medicine, instead of the blueprint, you actually know there’s all these people carrying letters, moving in and out of this building (We don’t really know where the building walls are, but we know that there must be something happening there)\nWhen you put the blueprint together with the movement inside the area of interest, you start to realize “oh, these are postal workers carrying things, and here’s the geometry of the building. That power really is actually quite useful.”\n\n1 +1 = 3\n\nThe first device to combine functional imaging with nuclear medicine imaging was the positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT)\nThese two separate modalities of functional imaging and anatomic imaging come together to actually make something better than each part individually (i.e., 1+1=3)\n\nAdvice Peter got from radiology people while in med school:\n“Anytime you order a test, in the back of your mind you have to be asking yourself, ‘Do you want anatomical information, or functional information or both?’”\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8460\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anatomical-images-of-the-brain-ct-and-mri-1024x542.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"542\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anatomical-images-of-the-brain-ct-and-mri-1024x542.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anatomical-images-of-the-brain-ct-and-mri-300x159.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anatomical-images-of-the-brain-ct-and-mri-768x407.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anatomical-images-of-the-brain-ct-and-mri.png 1496w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 2.

How does it produce that image?\n\nEffectively, X-ray is taking these high energy wavelength, and it actually penetrates right through the body\nAnywhere where there’s something dense, very hard like bone, the X-ray beam can’t make it through\nContrarily, the X-ray penetrates right through it and shines through soft tissue\nAnd that’s what gives us the white pictures of the bone because the film that’s exposed on the other side, the soft tissues, the X-rays have gone through\nTherefore, on the film on the other side it stays white\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8464\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chest-x-ray.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chest-x-ray.jpg 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chest-x-ray-150x150.jpg 150w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chest-x-ray-300x300.jpg 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chest-x-ray-768x768.jpg 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chest-x-ray-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 5.

radiopaedia.org\nIn the early days, were they aware of the damage of ionizing radiation?\n\nUnfortunately, there were lots of casualties due to radiation\nOur understanding of radiation has actually been moved by really traumatic events such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki where we’ve actually been able to watch people over time\n\nWhat can happen with radiation exposure?\n\nDNA of the cells get damaged and there’s a risk of inducing cancers with that\n\nDifferent types of x-rays and scans have differing amounts of radiation:\n\nPeter has a graph for his patients that lists a number of different technologies and their associated radiation amounts\nAt the top end of that spectrum you’d have a whole body PET-CT\nWe measure radiation in millisieverts\n\nWhat is a millisievert?\n\nA millisievert is the unit of measurement of radiation\nIt’s set by the standards group Système Internationale in France\nIt actually sets what a standard dose of radiation is\n\nUnderstanding radiation:\n\nThere’s good radiation, and there’s bad radiation\nAnytime you actually have any ion that’s actually releasing a component of its energy, that energy has to get deposited somewhere…\nIt comes off as a photon of energy \nIt’s never created, it’s never destroyed, so that the energy if it doesn’t go through you, it’s going to deposit in you (bad)\nIf it actually deposits in you, that’s where it can actually cause the damage\n\nDifferent types of imaging:\n-On one end you have the mammogram\n\nVery low amount of radiation in millisieverts, about 0.05)\n\n-On the other end of the scale you’ll have the PET-CT\n\nThe PET-CT couples the radiation from CT and from PET\nCT is a powerful X-ray that’s spinning around the body and creating a three-dimensional view of you\nPET is a positron-emission tomography which is using  radioactive glucose known as radioactive fluorine-18 which gives off a tremendous amount of energy (It’s the highest energy that you can have in imaging for radiation at 511 kiloelectron volts)\nSo a person could easily get 30 or 40 millisieverts in total in that scan if they were doing chest, abdomen and pelvis, for example.\n\nNuclear medicine by contrast… \n\nWhereas with nuclear medicine what we typically do is take pictures of everything from head to foot\nSince we’re actually going to inject somebody with the radioactive material, as a result, we’ve exposed them to that radiation to all parts of the body, we want to maximize the amount of data that we’re going to extract from that exposure.\n\nRecommended upper limit of millisieverts\n\nIn the United States the NRC recommends that no one receives more than 50 millisieverts in a year\nThat said, not all millisieverts come from imaging\n\n⇒ Places that contribute to radiation other than imaging\n\nThe higher altitude you live at, the more cosmic radiation you are exposed to (at sea level it’s about 2-3 per year)\n\nPeople in Denver are getting probably ~6 or 7 millisieverts a year\nAltitude in planes, can also contribute to radiation exposure\n\nFortunately, not very much exposure (like less than 0.1 millisievert per round trip from coast to coast)\nBut if you do L.A. over the North Pole, due to the ozone which absorbs radiation, your radiation exposure goes in exponentially (i.e., more than just the extra distance you travel) and that’s because of the ozone which absorbs radiation\n\n\n\n\nCertain geographies will actually have radon, which is another exposure to the millisieverts\n\n*Online calculator to determine radiation exposure from air travel*\n\nIn summary, just because the NRC says 50 as the limit, Peter doesn’t take that to mean we should go up to 50\n\nDo we have a sense of what the implication of that is in terms of normal physiology?\n“We do, and we don’t.” … Much of our understanding comes from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as other people like in Fuji reactor where people actually got exposed\nLandmark paper out of Columbia forced radiology as a field to actually look at the potential damaging effect of X-ray radiation\n\nLooked at the amount of radiation that people actually receive from CT scanners \nFound that the younger you are, the greater the risk of cancer induction from CT scanners\nAlso, females are actually more sensitive to radiation than men\n\nWhy are females more at risk than males?\n\nIt has to do with the fact that the egg is actually produced during embryonic stage\nAs a result, that DNA is effectively frozen in time\nAs women are getting older and older, they’re releasing these DNA in the eggs \nTherefore, the younger you are, the fresher the DNA\nAround age 12 is when this DNA comes out of the “frozen” state during the beginning of menstruation and that’s when these eggs start to be released. \nSo age 12 is the worst time for females to be exposed to radiation\n\nVery sad fact considering there are plenty of younger cancer patients that have no choice but to be exposed \n\n\n\nComputed tomography scans (CT scans): The history of CT, how it works, and why we use contrast [27:45]\n\nIf you truly understand how an X-ray works, then you understand what a computed tomography scan (CT scan) is doing because it’s just doing it in a three dimensional spiral\nThe amount of information in an X-ray is phenomenal but it is a 2D picture\nThe biggest problem with x-ray is that sometimes you’re actually overlapping different things, and you just can’t see\n\nWhen CT came around…\n\nThat’s when it actually really allowed us to look at things in 3D\nSurgeons could look at these and actually start to imagine what they’re going to be operating on… that is the power 3D imaging\n\nA simple way to think about it…\n\nAn X-ray is like a single flash… you get a picture \nA CT scan is really like a searchlight in a boat going around an island to actually get all the images the whole way around… it’s triangulation effective by spinning around in multiple different cycles by going around in 360 degrees\n\nCAT vs CT\n\nWe use the term CT very loosely, but it stands for computed tomography\nSometimes people back in the old days used to refer to it as CAT scanner where the “A” was for axial\n\nWhen was the first CT scan put into clinical practice? \n\nIn the 1970s, a phonographic company called EMI built the very first CT scanner\nTwo bit scanner (Two bit means you really only have one “flashlight” and one detector)\nOriginally used for the brain\n\nAnatomy of a CT scanner\n<iframe title=\"How Does a CT Scan Work?\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"

allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nBasically, 180 degrees apart you have the X-ray and the detector, \nThen it actually starts to spin around in rapid revolution. \nWhen you actually look at a machine, \n\nthere’s the donut hole in the middle,\nBut around it there’s actually the casing\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8465\"

A CT scanner with the cover off. Image credit: Reddit user: craftymethod\nExplaining bits\n\nFirst scanner was a two-bit (Two bit scanners only have one “flashlight” and one detector)\nWhen Peter was in residency, they were using 16 and 32 bit scanners (16 bit means you’ve got eight units spaced out equally and then you’ve got eight detecting surfaces)\n\nExample…\n\nLet’s say you start at the top of your head and move down to you toes\nAn eight “slice” means you take  one slice, then you’re measuring immediately below for another “slice”, and immediately below that again\nAs a result, as you’re circulating around the person or the patient, you’re actually doing 8 slices at a time, or 16 slices at a time, or 32 slices at a time, and so on.\nThe higher the number of slices, the more coverage you get\n\nThinner slices\n\nThe more thin you get, the more detail you can get from an imaging perspective\nBUT, the thinner you go, the more radiation required to overcome the signal and the noise background\n\n*You are trading off is an optimization problem: which is speed, resolution, radiation*\nWhat bit are we using today?\n\n256 is one of the common one\nAnd it’s mostly used for things that are rapidly moving, typically the heart\n\nDo we have a 512?\n\nIn research, yes.\nYou can actually make them as high as you want ⇒ The problem is you eventually get to diminishing returns of how thin the slices are and how many images you need\n\nWhat bit is needed to scan a body part that is NOT moving (e.g., the pancreas)? Is 128 or 64 enough? Does 256 offer an advantage?\n\n256 doesn’t really offer an advantage\nEight slices work quite well\n\nRemembering back to residency, Peter says that having a good radiologist was just as important as having a good surgeon\n\nTake pancreatic cancer, for example…\n\nMany patients with pancreatic cancer technically shouldn’t be operated on\nAnd you’d really like to know that before you enter the patient’s abdomen, which is not always possible\nBut the better the radiologist, the more information that can tell you prior to surgery\n\n\n\n⇒ Elliot Fishman’s 3D renderings of the pancreas\n“The whole power of this. . .is that our brain thinks in 3D. So, instead of looking slice by slice at a 2D image (like an X-ray), it became what our eyes could see, what our brains could see, and it actually really helped everybody plan their surgery. So, it really was revolutionary to actually start to look at things in three dimensions.”\nWhat is contrast and why do we use it?\n\nFor the CT world it’s actually an iodinated material\nWhat iodine does is it actually absorbs the photons and therefore makes things look white on a CT scan\nIt’s like having liquid bone in your blood stream or a liquid photon absorber\n\nHow it’s used\n\nIt’s injected it into the vein\nThen the heart pumps it around\nThat means we’re actually able to time when we actually take the CT image in order to be able to see what type of organ we’re looking for\n\nIf you get the arterial phase, you’ll actually see where the arteries are connecting to the organ\nOr you can wait for the venous phase, when the veins are returning blood flow from that organ, and you can actually see the entire detail of the organ\n\n\n\nIn summary…\n\nit’s a way to light up the blood vessels and light up the capillary net and everything in between. . .between the artery and the vein, to allow us to see the anatomic detail from the perspective of adding blood to it\nIn the absence of contrast,  blood looks functionally like water\n\nWhat are Hounsfield units?\n\nGodfrey Hounsfield came along and said, “How do we calibrate this?” \nThe scale has to do with density\nThere’s a range of Hounsfield units, from -1,000, 0, to 2,000\n\n0 is defined as water \n1,000 is basically air\nAs a result, we can actually see the difference between the density of bone and air, with water effectively in the middle\nAt +1,000, it is black\nAt -1,000, it is pure white\n\n\n\nThe biggest problem is that the eye actually can’t see that range…\n\nSo on our computers we actually will narrow down\nAt the higher Hounsfield units we can see lung\nThen we go down to look at the denser material (e.g., bone) \nBut we can’t see the whole thing\n\nYou can specify multiple parameters:\n\nYou could specify the width of your window\nAnd where it is centered\n\n⇒ For example, if you wanted to look at lung, you would center it much closer to positive numbers, and you don’t need a very wide range, do you? ⇒ “No. Not at all.”\nRECAP so far:\n\nX-ray is a purely anatomic study… there’s nothing functional about it\nCT by itself is also a very anatomic study\n\nBut you can add contrast to get even better information about the vasculature\nYou now have so much information that you can basically titrate or calibrate the window in which you look into that collection of radiation and specify your tissues\n\n\nCT are also very fast\n\n“The real power of CT is the speed.” \nIn trauma, you want to put them through the CT scanner as fast as possible in order to get the information out as fast as possible\n\n\n\nUltrasound: Benefits and limitations, and a special use for the heart [40:45]\n\nUltrasound is even faster than CT\nIt also doesn’t come with radiation\n\nHow does ultrasound work? And what are its limitations?\n\nIt’s basically it’s a high frequency, higher than what our ears can hear, and it’s penetrating solid tissue\nSo, it’s a high frequency sound wave (ultrasound) versus an ionizing wave of energy (radiation)\nAt every tissue interface it actually reflects back, like an echo\nThe time it takes for the sound to reflect back tells you how deep that tissue is\n\n⇒ Animals can actually do this…\n\nBats use this for sight\nWhales and dolphins are incredibly good at this… their sonography rivaled that of our finest medical equipment\n\nIn part that’s because the medium through which they travel is water, as opposed to what the bat has to do, which is go through this poorly, poorly dense air.\n\n\n\n⇒ In the air: ultrasound doesn’t penetrate very far, because it’s a high frequency, and you lose it because there’s no reflection coming back\n⇒ In the water, or even dense material like organs in the body, it actually reflects back easier\n\nIt’s that reflection that actually allows you to discern the different tissue types based on how quickly it reflects back\n\nCan ultrasound harm you in any way?\n\nYou could ultrasound yourself all day every day for the rest of your life, and you’re not increasing your risk of cancer\nWhereas if you did a CT scan of yourself every month, you’re going to be in trouble after several months\n\nWhat are the limitations of ultrasound?\n\nThe resolution isn’t as high as CT\n\nWith ultrasound you’re only looking at one slice in time\nWith ultrasound as you sweep through you get one layer. Then you get another layer. Then you get another layer. Then eventually that’s composited together to see what’s going on.\n\n\nUltrasound really struggles when it encounters air inside the body\n\nFor example, you look at a female pelvis, you want their bladder to be full, because then their bladder being full of fluid, it actually acts as a nice window to allow the ultrasound beam to pass right through to be able to see the uterus behind it.\n\n\n\nUltrasound for the heart\n\nThere’s a special subset of ultrasound that we do on the heart\n\n⇒ Where did that idea come about? Who figured that idea out?\n\nWe discovered there was a nice window that would actually allow you to miss the air in the lungs and look at the heart quite well\nAs a result, you can actually see where things were moving, such as the valves of the heart or the walls of the heart\nThen as well you actually add something called doppler, which is basically the frequency bouncing off of a blood vessel (If it’s going vs. coming, the frequency is going to be different)\nNow you can actually now start to see how blood is moving \nThere’s very thin window, usually underneath the chest and around the lung\n\n⇒ Echocardiogram\nYoutube: Echocardiogram: An ultrasound for your heart\n\nTransthoracic echo is over the chest\n\nThe technician is really pressing quite hard on the chest and it’s somewhat uncomfortable for the person getting the echo done\nThe jelly is doing everything to eliminate even a drop of air between the interface\n\n\nTransesophageal echocardiogram in the esophagus\n\nUsually during surgery\nyou get an even better view of the heart\n\n\n\nMore about ultrasound\n\nThe deeper you go with an ultrasound, the beam effectively fans out and gets thinner and thinner\nYou actually get less detail on the edges, whereas right in the center, right underneath the probe, is where your maximum amount of detail is going to be\nBy having it right in the esophagus, which is right beside the heart, you’re going to get fantastic detail\n\nImportance for trauma situations\n\nAs important as the CT scanner was in trauma, the ultrasound was actually the most important radiographic tool we had in trauma\n It was called a fast ultrasound in residency\nPenetrating trauma in particular, where you have to know, does this person need to go up to surgery? Is there fluid in the abdominal cavity? Fluid around the pericardium? These are surgical emergencies\nIf people weren’t 100% confident that there’s a problem, or not a problem, they’d go straight to CT scan, because you just couldn’t make that error\n\nA story from Peter’s personal experience in residency…\n\nPatient had the tiniest, tiniest stab wound, so less than a centimeter wide under the xiphoid\nIt could have been a shaving cut\nVital signs are more or less what you would expect\nPeter did ultrasound of his heart, it really looks like there’s something there, but I can’t quite figure it out\nSo took him to CT scanner\nThe danger of the CT scanner is it is not nearly as fast as a fast ultrasound\nSo if there is a major issue, the person could die while waiting for the CT scan\nPeter was once told by a junior resident, “Beware of the patient who gets wildly anxious when you lay them down.”\nSure enough, the guy freaked out when he laid down for the CT scan\nWe took him to the OR, opened him up immediately, and sure enough that knife had actually hit his pulmonary vein, and so that pulmonary vein was bleeding into his pericardium. \nHe would have had a cardiac tamponade if we had left him on that table.\nAmazingly, that patient went home three days later.\nRaj’s comment on Peter story: “You can see like the power of the clinical skill, as well as just the basic imaging. Right? The power of imaging plus clinical is pretty much where medicine is right now and how we actually are able to diagnose things quickly and efficiently.”\n\nDetecting breast cancer with mammography: When is works, when you need more testing, and defining ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’ [51:15]\nWhat is a mammogram? Why is it sometimes sufficient and other times not and you need an ultrasound?\n\nMammography is a lower attenuation x-ray (aka a weaker strength x-ray) since we never have to penetrate bone, and actually now it shines through the breast tissue, which is all soft tissue\n\nComposition of breast tissue\n\nBreast tissue is composed\n\nnormal subcutaneous tissue, mainly fat\nAs well as glandular tissue\nWomen are in their childbearing age… it’s almost all glandular tissue to produce milk for eventually feeding a baby\nAs women go through menopause… that glandular tissue can invariably involute (gets replaced with fat)\nBUT… in some women, it actually doesn’t get replaced with fat, and that is what we call the “dense breast tissue”\n\n\n\n⇒ Mammogram are good at: shining through fat which allows you to see very simple things, like calcification in fat\n⇒ Not so good at: Seeing through glandular tissue… sometimes that photon of low energy x-ray doesn’t make it through\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8466\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mammogram-fatty-vs-dense-1024x678.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mammogram-fatty-vs-dense-1024x678.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mammogram-fatty-vs-dense-300x199.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mammogram-fatty-vs-dense-768x508.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 7. Mammogram showing the difficulty of seeing cancer in dense breast tissue. Image credit: today.com\nWhy do some women retain extra glandular tissue?\n\nNobody really knows why some women retain that extra glandular tissue and in other women it turns to fat\nSo for women who are post menopausal, or if they’re pre-menopausal in their childbearing age, and they still have a lot of glandular tissue… that means a mammogram might not be enough \nTherefore they need another second imagine modality to look through the tissue such as ultrasound and/or MRI \n\nSensitivity and specificity of a mammogram\nPeter estimates from his memory that…\n\nA mammogram had a sensitivity of about 80, (call it ~84%)\nAnd a specificity of about 90% or 91%\n\n⇒ Does that sound about right?\n\nIt depends actually, says Raj\nIt actually becomes really critical in the fact that depending on the breast density, you’re going to know how helpful a mammogram may or may not be\n\nComparison over time:\n\nOne of the other things that becomes actually very, very powerful in the mammogram is to actually use comparison over time\nThat’s why they recommend screening intervals of either one or two years\nThat’s a matter of academic debate, however…\n\nIf you have a mammogram taken, and then let’s say two years later you do another one, it’s actually far more sensitive to see that subtle change over time than it is to actually look at an individual mammogram all on its own\nA single mammogram on a dense woman, its sensitivity is about 55%\nIt’s actually quite poor, whereas on a woman who actually has fatty tissue… it’s very high (up to 95%)\n\n\n\nExplaining sensitivity and specificity\nWhen we say a mammogram has an 80% sensitivity, here’s what we mean:\n\nIf there are 100 women who have breast cancer\nAnd we subject them to a mammogram\n\n80 of them will test positive (correctly)\nBut 20 of them will test negative (incorrectly)\n\n\nThe sensitivity is the true positive rate over the true positives plus the false negatives\nThe higher the sensitivity, the less likely you are to take someone who has the cancer and miss them. \n\nWhat does it mean to have 90% specificity? \n\nTake 100 women who we absolutely know DO NOT have breast cancer\nAfter you do a mammogram on all of them…\n\n90 of them will correctly identify as NOT having breast cancer\nBut 10 of them will be found to have breast cancer (incorrectly positive)\n\n\nSo, the specificity is the number of true negatives over the true negatives plus the false positives.\n\n⇒ A woman whose breasts are very fatty (i.e., not glandular)… you’re driving that specificity up (i.e., reducing the number of false positives)\n⇒ A woman who might have very, very dense breast tissue… you may drive your sensitivity down to 50%. \n\nThat means on a given day half the women that walk into your clinic who have breast cancer are going to be told they don’t have it\n“It’s like flipping a coin.”\n\n“It makes you realize you can’t just rely on one test, especially when that one test has such low sensitivity and specificity, depending on the individual.”\nHow close are we to having artificial intelligence in mammography?\n\nMany people think machine learning and AI will invariably infiltrate medicine\nIt seems to me that one of the best places for it to do so is in comparative radiology\nHow close are we to using AI to help perform and read mammograms?\n\nMany companies are trying \nIt’s more used as a “second look” in combo with a person\n\n\n\nCan we get north of 97/98% on specificity and sensitivity?\n\n“I think that’s a pretty high target to achieve.”\nThe biggest problem is because we’re so unique\n\nThe way the breast is compressed\nThe way everything is done when a mammogram is taken is somewhat different each time\nThe amount of coverage is a little bit different each time.\n\n\n“It’s possible, but are we there yet? No…but we’re getting better.”\n\nWhat is molecular breast imaging (MBI)?\n\nA lot of radiation, close to 20 millisieverts, which is about 40% of your annual radiation limit\nIt’s a functional test in the realm of nuclear medicine\nWe’re actually taking radioactive material, and then we’re actually injecting it into the body\nTissues that actually have increased mitochondria (like in breast cancer), will concentrate a radiotracer called sestamibi\n\n⇒ Is that test still done?\n\nRarely, but it can be done in women who actually have very, very dense breast tissue, and you actually need to see what’s going on. It can be done, but a lot of it’s actually been replaced with positron emission tomography scans\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): How it works, defining terms, and looking at the most common types of MRI [1:03:45]\n\n“It doesn’t get a lot more complicated than an MRI.”\n“It’s really an engineer’s dream.”\n\nWho the heck thought of this?\n\nPeter Mansfield is actually one of the main creators\nThe MRI machine really it’s actually quite the amazing tool\nIt actually wasn’t initially developed for imaging. It was actually just developed on a bench top where they’re actually kind of looking to see what the effect of electromagnetic waves does to anything. \nSomebody will wind up sticking tissue in it and said…\nWhat goes in one side comes out a little bit differently on the other side. As a result we can actually determine what that composition and material was.\n\nDoes that mean the NMR was really the precursor to the MRI?\n\nIt’s the exact same device, the NMR basically is just a two dimensional version of the MRI which is three dimensions\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8467\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NMR-spec-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NMR-spec-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NMR-spec-225x300.jpg 225w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NMR-spec.jpg 1944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" />\nFigure 8.

Image credit: faulresearchgroup.com\nPhysics to understand how an MRI works:\nYou take a molecule like alcohol…\n\nIt’s got these two carbons that are joined\n\nThe first carbon has three hydrogens around it\nThe next carbon has a hydrogen and a hydrogen, but then instead of the third hydrogen, it gets an oxygen which is bound to a hydrogen (That is the stuff that people drink and get drunk on)\n\n\nPut that into a nuclear magnetic resonance machine (MRI), and you’re going to see different peaks\n\nIt’s going to show you that there is a methyl group somewhere\nIt can’t tell you what it sees, but it tells you that there’s a carbon bound to three hydrogens\n\n\n\n⇒ How does it do that? \n*NOTE: Raj is going to use the term hydrogen and proton interchangeably*\nFirst, when we look at the NMR spectroscopy … \n\nIt’s basically a magnet that’s creating a field and somehow through that we can see how the hydrogen is bonded to either the oxygen or the carbon in the ethanol molecule\nThe NMR is really just a hydrogen/proton detector\nThe way the magnetic field of hydrogen behaves is completely different depending on if it’s attached to either the oxygen and OH of alcohol, or the CH3 of carbon\nIt actually gives off a different wavelength\nAs a result, that’s how we’re actually able to get this, what we call NMR Spectra. \n\nNext…\n\nRaymond Damadian is considered to be the father of MRI\nHe realized that we can we actually put a human in to see the soft tissue\nOur body is composed of roughly 70% water\nSo here’s a lot of hydrogen on fats, so can we see that frequency difference\nIf we’re 70% water, that’s 2:1 hydrogen over oxygen there, and then all the fat that’s in us is all the hydrogen to the carbon there. \nThere’s basically hydrogen in protein as well.\n\nMRI is a hydrogen imager\n\nAn MRI is a hydrogen imager\nBasically, we’re looking at hydrogen nuclei, which is a proton\nPeople actually talk about proton spectroscopy, which is NMR, and MRI is just basically a simple hydrogen imager\n\nMagnets of the MRI\nHow it is measured:\n\nTypically, it’s regarded as a tesla\nA tesla is roughly 10,000 gauss\nA gauss is effectively what the North Pole can produce\nWhen we actually get into the MRI field, it becomes so much stronger\n\nHow strong is the magnet and why does it need to be so strong?\n\nThe reason we actually need that high tesla field strength is because…\n\nWe’re actually taking hydrogen (which is typically not that magnetic compared to like a magnet that we think about)\nAnd we’re trying to orient that little dipole of the water molecule or fat molecule, a certain direction\nThat’s what the static field does, and that’s why it has to be so strong. \n\n\n\nMRI machines have different levels:\n\n1.5 Tesla\n3 Tesla, which is double the strength, \n7 Tesla\nAnd so on.\nThe higher the Tesla they go, the more it’s actually able to pull all of the hydrogens and orient them in one direction\n\nNormal position of our body’s hydrogen molecules:\n\nNormally our hydrogen molecules are bouncing around randomly, pointed at any which direction, and that there is no kind of magnetic component to us\nWhen you go into a strong magnetic field, these hydrogens basically kind of turn and orient themselves in that direction\nAnd so that’s what actually provides the initial basis for an MRI\n\nHow the MRI is actually working:\n<iframe title=\"How Does an MRI Scan Work?\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1CGzk-nV06g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe way it works is you actually have a superconducting wire that’s actually running just above absolute zero degrees Kelvin\nYou can never turn that off. \nPumps are constantly on to keep it cold so that when you actually put an electric field in like a loop of wire, that electric field is what actually generates the magnetic field in a perpendicular direction\n\nWhat is the direction right now that that magnet is being oriented?\n\nNow, if we were to walk in the scanner today, there’s a bed running through a donut\nThe donut is where that loop of superconducting wire is sitting in, \nMost of the time the north will actually face away from the control center, and that’s the direction of north\n\nWhat is the right hand rule on this?\n\nIt can tell you which way the power and the coil is going\nIf you’re looking from the foot of the bed, it’s actually going in a clockwise circle, and that’s the right hand rule.\n\nIf you walked into a room where there was a 10 or a 20 Tesla magnet, what do you feel anything, and would it do anything to you that is harmful?\n\nThe actual magnetic field won’t do that much\nWhen you get very, very strong to a moving magnetic field, you can actually start to feel it because it can actually trigger your nerve impulses to start moving\nSometimes people actually get twitching\nSometimes people describe getting temporary headaches, and as soon as they step away from the field, it all goes away\n\nWhy does an MRI take so long?\nIf you just wanted to get an MRI of the abdomen, that could easily take 40 minutes. Whereas, a CT scan of the abdomen can take two minutes. What’s the deal?\n\nIt’s the way the images are acquired, they’re a completely different mechanism\nIf you go back and talk about the X-ray, it’s basically like a single flash where you’re actually looking through everything\nCT is basically this X-ray that’s constantly on, spinning around and basically sort of circulating around you. \nWhereas, the MRI behaves completely differently\n\nDuring the period of time of that acquisition, what it’s doing is, everything that’s inside the center of that donut is being pulled in a certain direction, all the hydrogens on your water and fat. \nThe loud part of the MRI is actually a temporary magnetic field, which is countering that static field, and so it’s actually now pulling all the hydrogens in the opposite direction. \nAnd then in that opposite direction, it actually turns off, and then the hydrogens reorient to where they were in that static field. \nAs they reorient, they actually give off a different frequency, and that different frequency takes a while to gather, and that’s what we call the TR, or repetition time, or the TE of the echo time, and that you can’t speed up.\n\n\n\nMRI terms\n\nTR is the repetition pulse time\nTE is the time it takes to relax back to its original position\nT1 weighted image is the one that’s really anatomically beautiful where you know what you are looking at\nThe T2 weighted image seems to highlight water more… so things that are water look more white, but it doesn’t have the anatomic resolution\n\nHow do you differentiate those T1 vs T2 images?\n\nOn the T1 image\n\nwe actually see nothing but fat\nFat gives a lot of signal, which is what makes a nice and bright\nWe see a single element that the hydrogen would be bonded to that we’re looking at. \n\n\nWhereas, a T2, \n\nwe’re actually now seeing two elements.\n\n\n  We’re seeing fat and water, \n\nand so those two elements are actually coming off at different frequencies from the MRI machine and you have to wait a longer echo time to be able to pick up the water, because it returns back to normal, much more slowly than the fat does. \nT2 weighted images take longer to acquire, because the TE is long, because you have to wait to get both fat and water.\n\n\n\nWhat’s the difference in the TR between the T1 and T2?\n\nIt’s all going to be entirely dependent on the machine,\nso you actually have to customize those parameters for every single machine. \nAnd so, that actually kind of takes a while to actually kind of go and calibrate and kind of get used to what your eyes’ used to seeing, \nand it’s also going to be dependent on the signal, the overall magnetic field, \nand there’s overall signal to noise for that coil set that you’re using. \nEach one has to be effectively tuned.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8468\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/T1-vs.-T2-933x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"933\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/T1-vs.-T2-933x1024.png 933w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/T1-vs.-T2-273x300.png 273w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/T1-vs.-T2-768x843.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/T1-vs.-T2.png 1172w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px\" />\nFigure 9.

If I was looking at you, and I said, ‘We’re going to start the image from your top down, first we’re going to put a gradient on from top to bottom, so it’s going to be a little bit of a higher frequency at the top, a little bit of a lower frequency lower down, and then we’re actually also going to look at phase from right to left. Depending on how your body’s oriented and where the blood flow is going to be, we’re going to look at phase and frequency, which now will bring us into the realm of a Fourier transform’. With the pulses, we’re effectively looking at all these repetitive sign waves, and we’re actually plotting that in frequency and phase domain.”\nThe Fourier transform\nHow does one get into MRI radiology without a background in mathematics and physics?\n\n“It seems it would be impossible”, says Peter\n“It’s a struggle” says Raj\n\n“The difference with the MRI is that you start in this Fourier domain, and because we’re a three dimensional object, when you’re looking at a two dimensional plane, that’s the Fourier transform. When you’re now at that third dimension, it becomes what we call k-space, so it’s effectively a two dimensional Fourier transform, which is what the MRI world operates on. It’s called k-space.”\nWhat types of MRIs are the most common? \nThe most common ones that people have:\n\nMRI of the knee\nMRI of your back\nMRI of the head\n\nACL injury\nWhat sequences would be run today, if you wanted to evaluate someone’s ACL?\n\nFirst, you’ll want the anatomy image, so that’s our plain T1 because “fat is beautiful, and it actually allows us to see everything really well, and it looks like what we’re actually accustomed to seeing.”\nSecondly, we’d do a T2 fat sat sequence (fat saturation) \n\nA T2 image looks at fat and water, and then we actually suppress the fat, so really all we’re seeing is water\n\nWhy? ⇒ because of edema\n\nEdema, when there’s something going wrong in the body, almost anywhere, edema happens\n\nYou bang your hand and it swells up, that swelling is edema. \nYou injure your knee, it swells up, that’s edema \n\n\n\n\nThat’s kind of a simple concept in MRI that is quite often lost, but it’s very, very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8476\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ACL-tear-T2-MRI-1024x1019.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1019\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ACL-tear-T2-MRI-1024x1019.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ACL-tear-T2-MRI-150x150.png 150w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ACL-tear-T2-MRI-300x300.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ACL-tear-T2-MRI-768x764.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ACL-tear-T2-MRI.png 1222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 10.

Well, the engineering technique makes the difference\n“But, most people don’t think that way. They think bigger is better.”\n\nHow did Raj manage to tinker with 150 variables to produce such a uniquely powerful machine?\n\nRaj is an engineer at heart who works in medicine\nHe worked backwards, starting with the questions, “What do I want to know? What do I want to see? How do I make it work?” \nFrom there he spoke to the MRI physicists who really know this equipment\nMany times the physicists would write up a new sequence and ask Raj to test it out so Raj would scan himself and then look at the results from a functional point of view, as well as an imaging perspective\n\nWhen creating this machine, what were you optimizing for? \n1 The first thing I wanted to do is to optimize the dose or radioactivity in order to cover everything from head to foot ⇒ In radiology, typically we’re just doing a snapshot of an individual part (like a head or a neck or a torso)… but Raj wanted to see how it ALL works\n2 Secondly, Raj wanted to customize his hardware to allow him to move people around while they’re on the table while they’re laying there to be able to connect the head with the neck, with the chest, with the abdomen…\n\nOnce the hardware was pieced together, he started to test and test while talking to more physicists\n\n3 Third, he thought about the patient’s point of view…\n\nRaj thought about… “If I’m a patient, what would I want to know?”\n\nNumber 1: I’d want to know that my brain’s okay (arteries in my brain are okay, they’re not going to rupture)\nNumber 2: “Do I have cancer? Yes or no?” \n\nIn nuclear medicine, most of the tests are binary, we can actually answer that with a yes or a no. \nIn radiology, it’s not so clear, it’s kind of like maybe (playing more statistics and probability) \n\n\n\n\n\n⇒ So the question was… “How do I marry these two together?”\n\nRaj decided to combine the following:\n\nMRI… which actually allows you to take that “yes or no” binary answer of functional nuclear medicine in terms of cancer\nCombined with…\nThe anatomic localization, and understanding of tissue types that radiology has\n\n\n\n“I merged those two together onto one machine.”\nWhat is the functional arm that you’ve brought into it?\nDiffusion weighted imaging with background subtraction (DWIBS)\n\nDWIBS is looking at water at two points in time… within about 60 microseconds of water motion\nIf the water hasn’t moved between the two points in time, it’s because it’s effectively trapped between walls\n\nWhy? ⇒ i) There’s a tight cell membrane or ii) components of a cell are preventing that water from moving\n\n\n\nWhat do you infer clinically about that tissue?\n\nWhen water isn’t moving, that means that there’s going to be a high density of cells there\nRaj calls it the lump detector\n\nE.g., with breast cancer, women are able to feel a lump themselves quite easily and what they are feeling is a dense cluster of cells\n\n\n\nPeter: “It’s actually unmistakable what cancer feels like to the touch because it is so in contrast to what normal tissue feels like … it’s entirely obvious just based on the firmness of the tissue.”\nSummarizing Raj’s unique equipment:\n“We’re actually combining the anatomic and functional. Just like that on the PET-CT where that famous ‘one plus one equals three’… that is exactly what we were doing. And the beauty of it is there’s absolutely no radiation, so there’s no risk.”\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8472\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sample-of-the-high-resolution-anatomic-and-functional-images-taken-during-a-Prenuvo-scan-1024x661.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"661\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sample-of-the-high-resolution-anatomic-and-functional-images-taken-during-a-Prenuvo-scan-1024x661.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sample-of-the-high-resolution-anatomic-and-functional-images-taken-during-a-Prenuvo-scan-300x194.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sample-of-the-high-resolution-anatomic-and-functional-images-taken-during-a-Prenuvo-scan-768x496.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 13. Sample of the high resolution anatomic and functional images taken during an MRI scan with Raj’s Prenuvo scanner. The multiple sequences, tissue planes and high signal to noise functional DWI images allows for precise tissue characterization and anatomic localization. \nThe risk of false positives in cancer detection, and how Raj’s MRI can reduce the number of false positives (i.e., increase specificity) [1:43:40]\nThe risk of cancer screening\nSince there is no radiation with an MRI, the real risk is that of a false positive, says Peter\n\nThe harm can manifest in 2 ways:\n\n1) Physical harm\n\nMeaning by something we do subsequently, for example, another biopsy or a biopsy or a subsequent biopsy that was unnecessary\n\n\n2) Emotional harm\n\nE.g., The toll it takes on you to see a shadow in a part of your body and have to sit there and have a discussion about what it could be… “it’s probably a cyst, but it might be a tumor, we probably need to do X,Y,Z.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the sensitivity and specificity of Raj’s equipment?\n\nRaj looks at the sensitivity and specificity organ by organ\nFor example, in the liver, the simple thing we want to kind of note, “Is there a problem? Yes or no?”\n\nBy combining this functional as well as an anatomic imaging together, we’re actually really able to nail that down\n\n\n\nRaj had two cases of a false positive in 1,000 cases\n1 Male with false positive for breast cancer\n\nThe DWI showed a difference in density between one breast and the other\nHe then got an ultrasound which also showed something but weren’t sure what it was\nHe then got a biopsy and it came back as normal (he had breast glandular tissue)\n⇒ So let’s talk just about the harm there…\n\nEmotionally, that man probably a ton of time being stressed out about this \nSecondly, he had to get a procedure, he had to get a needle stuck into his breast tissue\n\n\n\n2 Woman in her late fifties with a false positive for breast cancer\n\nTurned out that she had an unusual scar on her breast from a bad car accident that trapped fluid in it\n\nWhat is the scariest false positive?\n\nMost concerning are the false positives that occur deeper in the body\nPeter says the little shadow in the pancreas, where you just don’t know it was this in Adenocarcinoma (fatal) or something that isn’t cancer at all\n\n⇒ Famous cautionary tale of a false positive:\n\nAt Stanford several years ago where a woman who got a CT scan which showed something in the pancreas\nGot an ERCP guided biopsy\nOne complication led to another, led to another and she died of sepsis\nAnd it turned out she didn’t have pancreatic cancer\n\n“That’s kind of where the real value of actually having MRI’s as opposed to CT comes in. The fact that when we’re looking at organs, in particular like the pancreas or any of the visceral solid organs, we’re looking about seven different filters, looking at it different ways, top to bottom, front to back to really be able to see what’s going on. That’s where what we call ‘contrast density’ becomes really important . . . we can actually pick out the pancreatic duct as well as a bile duct and be able to see that just standing out against the rest of the organ.”\nThe unique software Raj created to pair with his MRI machine [1:51:15]\nRaj created software to show a rotating diffusion weighted image map\n\nThe display tool is effectively taking a page out of the nuclear medicine, positron emission tomography or PET-CT handbook\nAllows you to view everything going on through the entire body (like making it transparent person where any of the black spots that stand out would be the hard spots or the firm areas)\n\nSome advantages of using a “low power magnet”:\n\nZero gaps in the spine \nYou had the dark brain (obviously full of firm fluid) \nThen you have this dark beautiful tail coming out of it, which is the spinal fluid, but it was perfectly smooth\nThat’s actually one of the important things because magnets actually have a lot of “homogeneity problems”\nThe fact that you want it to be perfect so that the field in between the top and the bottom and the left and the right are identical\nAs soon as you put a person in there, that comes in various sizes and shapes, they actually distort that magnetic field… we actually built it so we can actually go and tune it for all these body shapes\n\n“It looks just like you’re looking at the FDG-PET juxtaposed with the CT” says Peter\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8473\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Coronal-Prenuvo-sequences-compared-with-the-fragmented-low-resolution-images--1024x686.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Coronal-Prenuvo-sequences-compared-with-the-fragmented-low-resolution-images--1024x686.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Coronal-Prenuvo-sequences-compared-with-the-fragmented-low-resolution-images--300x201.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Coronal-Prenuvo-sequences-compared-with-the-fragmented-low-resolution-images--768x515.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 14.

Using Raj’s unique MRI machine, this is a combination of detailed anatomic images with the functional image (white background) which demonstrates a solid 8mm breast cancer lesion (in red circle) which cannot be readily delineated on other sequences.\nWhy a DW-MRI is still not a perfect test [1:59:00]\n\nThe biggest problem with MRI is that it has no standardization whatsoever \nThere’s actually a movement called Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA) trying to push to standardize the amount of signal to noise coming off of MRI machines with the goal that if you get a scan at one site or another site, the image quality is the same\n\nWhat is standing in the way?\n\nIt actually relies on the vendors coming together \nThis is fortunately starting to move forward with this organization, QIBA of RSNA and they’re doing it organ by organ (e.g., for standardizing breast MRI screening)\n\nIt’s really unfortunate…\n\n…Because this is of all the imaging tools, MRI is the most powerful\nBut it really does need the stability for standardization. \nIn order to make it standardized, you need to get the physicist together with the radiologists\nBut quite often that doesn’t happen because of the language barrier, the language of physics\n\nThe potential for advancing MRI technology: Where does Raj think it could improve in the next 5-10 years? [2:03:00]\nWhat does Raj want to see in the next 5 or 10 years that would improve the technology?\n\nMore speed!\n“What I’d actually like to do, and when you see sort of what we’re doing, the speed with which we do and that the detail and resolution that we’re able to acquire and about 55 minutes is really unprecedented anywhere, but I know from a physics point of view that I could speed this up further.”\nGOAL:  To have these scans that under half an hour, or even faster,\n\n“It can be done from a physics point of view. It’s not a technological barrier.”\nWhat makes it so uncomfortable by the end of the scan in terms of body temperature?\nPart of the reason for speeding up the MRI is because of the heat that is produced making it uncomfortable for the patient\n\nThe heat is due to the amount of energy that’s being absorbed\nThe radio frequency is the same thing as a cell phone called SAR or a Specific Absorption Ratio\nThe hydrogen ions are basically moving around and that’s basically effectively heating you up\nSo it’s not quite like a microwave, but you can actually think about it as a microwave\n\nHead to toe\n\nWe do the head first and that’s not nearly as much as doing mid and lower body\nThe thighs, for example, are probably where a ton of that heat gets generated right\nWhen you look at basically the overall blood flow, which is what cools your body, the brain takes 20% of your cardiac output (it’s this big heat sink…it’s a just cools everything away) \nWhereas when you get down and lower to the legs, which you’re all muscle, it’s going to heat that up, and so that’s why we figured out how to orient these in what organization to make or what plan of sequences to make it not as uncomfortable\n\nAre there any commercially available scanners that can match the resolution of Raj’s images? [2:06:00]\nAre you scans fully isotropic?\n\n“It’s isotropic in the brain, but in the rest of the body we’re actually doing more conventional clinical images.”\n\nWhat does isotropic mean?\n\nWhat isotropic basically means is that we’re slicing you in cubes\nSo one by one by one millimeter cube, for example\nThe power of actually doing that one by one by one, is that you can now look at things again in three dimensions in any direction you want\nThe detail and resolution is perfect\n\nMRI\n\n*Whereas MRI typically can’t be done isotopically just because of time*\nYou want to cover as much as possible, but you want what we call, “in plain resolution”, which is how you orient the first gradient to have the highest amount of detail\nThen you typically will take a perpendicular view\nPeter: “And that’s why when you do these rotations off your sagittal plane, the resolution deteriorates wildly in conventional scans, right?”\nRaj: “Right, exactly. And so the diffusion that we’re doing are done isotropic, but unconventional, not often.”\n\nThe following video is showing Raj’s cancer detection technique at work. Per Raj, “This set of videos illustrates the power of functional imaging with MRI, and the utility of isotropic imaging wherein we are maximizing signal to noise to make tumor masses (which are more solid than normal tissue stand out). The way this sequence works is as a lump=hardness detector, thus for cancer detection think of the adage given to women: ‘breast cancer feel for lumps’.”\n<iframe title=\"DWI_for_cancer_detection_without_lymph_node_cancer_282707021_1080x1080_F30\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/346458506?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nSo is there a commercially available scanner that can do that?\n\n“Not yet.

Images from a whole body study which shows fragmented images which do NOT  encompass sufficient detail for adequate diagnosis (from Germany).\nRaj seems so far ahead of the curve, how is that the case?\n\nWell it comes down to basic engineering of signal to noise ⇒ If you can make all the hardware that you have really sing, our signal to noise is so much better.\nThen you can basically dial it to effectively where you want\nSo if you need more and more signal depending on your machines. I guess horsepower and coil configuration just takes time.

[2:08:40]\n\nIt’s really hard to throw a whole body image at a machine and have it solve even the simplest problem such as differentiating between each organ\nWhereas if you weren’t doing a whole body, if you were just doing a liver image, that’s an easier problem to hand the machine cause it already knows it’s looking at liver\n\n⇒ How far are we away from a machine being able to help you do this?\n\nThe goal is to have machines make radiologists more efficient and never miss anything\nWe can’t have a second reader all the time, but if you have a machine being a second reader, you wind up actually training that machine as you go along\n\n⇒ Mammography: There are machines assisting radiologists in mammography\nFinal thoughts on machine learning:\n\nIt seems that where the machine might first be able to make a dent in what you’re doing is not the patient who gets their first scan, but the one who gets the repeat scan\nSpecifically, the paired t-test seems to be an easier problem to solve but an important problem to solve \nWhen you actually go and you take a paired of t-test, and you actually do a subtraction of where you’re looking for the difference or that delta, it can actually stand out and become very, very simple and very obvious. \nOnce that’s subtraction is done, I think that’s where machine learning will actually really help make us more efficient and at the end of the day, we just don’t want to miss anything.\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialLinks provided by Raj:\nSpreadsheet showing the full list of conditions that Raj’s Prenuvo MRI can detect versus other comprehensive ‘whole body’ scans found at a premier clinic in San Diego (“we have lots of patients who have done both”): Comparison of conditions\nOverview of radiation from health physics society: Radiation and Risk: Expert Perspectives | Health Physics Society (hps.org)\nA nice table of all radiation procedures: Doses from Medical Radiation Sources | Michael G.

(NB most CT exposures are way higher than this due to SNR issues). All CT studies output a DLP value which can be converted to mSV effective dose by multiplying by an estimator factor which for chest is 0.014, abdo/pelvis 0.020, which gives the average of 0.017 for body  Note that these multiplier estimator factors are stupidly hard to find in the literature, but very valuable for all patients to know in my opinion.”\n\nCalculator to determine radiation exposure from air travel (need airport IATA codes, flight time at altitude, ascent and descent): FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION OFFICE OF AEROSPACE MEDICINE CIVIL AEROSPACE MEDICAL INSTITUTE  | (jag.cami.jccbi.gov)\nLinks & Resources mentioned in the podcast interview:\nRaj’s imaging company: AIM Medical Imaging | (aimmedicalimaging.com) [9:30]\nMore info about Raj’s Prenuvo MRI scanner: \n\nFull Body Imaging \nPrenuvo Body Scans at AIM-Why full body MRI?\n\nPeter’s instagram post about his whole-body scan: @peterattiamd 4/16/2019 | (instagram.com) \nFirst telerobotics, telepresence conference ever held in the United States: THE FIRST EXPLORATION TELEROBOTICS SYMPOSIUM – TELEPRESENCE: A NEW PARADIGM FOR HUMAN-ROBOTIC COOPERATION.
