  "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter explains his framework for understanding what lab tests can (and cannot) inform us as it pertains to overall longevity, with a specific focus on atherosclerosis, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and the physical body. Additionally, Peter shares details into two patient case studies around cardiovascular disease, including how the lab results influenced his diagnosis and treatment plan for the patients. Once again, Bob Kaplan, Peter’s head of research, will be asking the questions.

objective of longevity [4:25]\nThe two components of longevity—Lifespan and healthspan\n\nLifespan=How long you live\nHealthspan=How well you live \n\n–Lifespan:\nLiving longer is effectively going to boil down to how long can you delay the onset of chronic disease\nLooking at centenarians: \n\nThey don’t live longer once they get a disease, they just take longer to get a disease.\nTheir superpower is how long they can go before they get the first chink in their armor\nBut once that disease sets in, they’ve basically been exposed to kryptonite and they are now just mere mortals like the rest of us.\nIn other words, they simply have a “phase shift” of about 20 years before they get chronic disease compared to the average person\n\n“So if you want to live longer, the mathematical equivalent function is to delay the onset of chronic disease, not figure out ways to live longer once you have chronic disease.”\n \nA healthcare system set up to react to a disease rather than prevent it [8:00]\n\nThe entire healthcare system is mostly geared towards helping you live longer once you acquire disease\n\nThis is the opposite approach to what Peter described above\n\n\nPrevention is not really the mainstay of medicine. \nMedicine has had its greatest impact or its greatest efforts basically on what to do once you have a disease\n\nWith Alzheimer’s disease…\n\nWe have no drugs that can reverse the dementia or even slow its progression once it sets in\n\nWith cancer…\n\nWe’ve made very little progress in 50 years in regards to the long-term survival rate\nWith metastatic cancer, it’s about a 5% improvement we’ve made in 50 years\n\nWith cardiovascular disease…\n\nIt’s the one place where we’ve seen the most progress on managing a disease once it sets in\nWhy?\n\nAtherosclerosis is much more of a continuum than dementia and cancer\nAnd it’s less complicated\n\n\n\nNew England Centenarian Study (Thomas Perls)\nThe Longevity Genes Project (Nir Barzilai)\nCentenarians put into 3 categories—The delayers, escapers, and survivors article: Morbidity Profiles of Centenarians: Survivors, Delayers, and Escapers (Evert, et al., 2003) [10:45]\n“We don’t really function in a system of health care. We function in a system of ‘sick care’, meaning we interact with our healthcare system in a manner that is—once there is a problem, we seek help.”\n \nThe four pillars of chronic disease, and the three components of healthspan [14:30]\nThe Four Horsemen of Chronic Disease\n-The following amounts over 80% of deaths in people over 50 who do not smoke…\n\nAtherosclerotic disease (comprised of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease)\nCancer\nNeurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer’s disease being the most common)\n“Foundational disease” ⇒ a spectrum of everything hyperinsulinemia to insulin resistance to fatty liver disease to type 2 diabetes\n\n3 Components of Healthspan\n\nCognitive\nPhysical/structural\nEmotional\n\n-With the cognitive piece…\n\nMost of the efforts we put into preserving cognition are basically directly in line with the efforts we will make to reduce the risk of dementia\n\n–With the physical component…\n\nThis is really the first thing that starts to compromise quality of life (knee pain, back pain, etc.)\nIt occurs decades before someone dies\n“There’s no time that’s too soon to start caring about [physical/structural health].”\n\n-With the emotional piece… \n\nBy far least tethered to age\nThe labs are not as relevant with this piece so it won’t be the focus of this episode \n\n \nAtherosclerosis—How much can labs tell us about risk? [18:00]\n“If I’m going to give an overall grade to how well we can use blood tests to handicap a person’s risk of atherosclerosis, it’s going to get a pretty good grade.”\n1 | Lipids\n\nAtherosclerosis is driven first and foremost by lipid proteins\nThe main lipoproteins we care about:\n\nApoB – can be measured directly\nLp(a) – can be measured directly\nVLDL remnants – can’t measure directly but can measure VLDL cholesterol which is a reasonable proxy\n\n\n\n2 | Inflammation\n\nThe disease requires inflammation\nThere are lots of inflammation markers but not all of these are specific to cardiac inflammation\n\nNon-specific ones: C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, interleukins\nMore specific to cardiac: Oxidized LDL, myeloperoxidase, Lp-PLA2\n\n\n“We sort of look at C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, Lp-PLA2 usually just one time. I don’t think it provides much ongoing support. I think that’s a reasonable area of insight, but one for which I think we still don’t have the greatest biomarkers there.”\n\n3 | Endothelial health\n\nImpaired endothelial function and health plays a role in the disease\nIn terms of labs… “this is probably an area where we don’t have the most insight”\nThings that irritate the endothelial:\n\nHyperinsulinemia\nElevated homocysteine\nElevated uric acid\nImpaired kidney function\n\n\nWe can also measure some other indirect proxies:\n\nADMA\nSDMA\nThese are arginine derivatives that impair nitric oxide formation and their clearance is impaired by elevated homocysteine\n\n\n\n4 | Metabolic health\n\nThe metabolic component is enormous\n\nglucose levels\ninsulin levels\nTriglyceride levels \n\n\nAll these (and much more) can be measured with blood testing\n\nWhat the average doctor is doing in terms of assessing risk:\n\nUnfortunately, many doctors are assessing risk for cardiovascular disease in their patients predicated mostly on their LDL cholesterol rather than ApoB\nEven looking at non HDL cholesterol is far superior than looking at LDL cholesterol \n\n⇒ Peter’s article about heart disease and prevention: When does heart disease begin (and what this tells us about prevention)? \n“It is obviously upsetting to me that a disease that’s as prevalent as cardiovascular disease is still kind of underperforming in terms of how seriously we treat prevention.”\n \nCoronary calcium score (CAC)—interpreting results based on your age [24:15]\nCoronary artery calcium scoring \n⇒ CAC was discussed in detail on AMA #5\n\nAge matters big time when interpreting the CAC scores\nA young patient…\n\nthey shouldn’t have any calcification\nSo a calcium score of zero in somebody below 50 doesn’t really help us much \n\n\nIn an older person… \n\nsomebody who’s over 75 that has significant calcification doesn’t tell us much either\n\n\nBut the flip sides of those help a lot…\n\nSomeone below 50 that has even a speck of calcium immediately has an increase in risk\nAnd conversely, somebody who’s 80 who has not a speck of calcium is immediately in a lower category of risk regardless of what their biomarkers say\n\n\nThere’s virtually no downside to doing this test, and yet it adds information. \nBut don’t over-interpret what it tells you\nYou should also know what its blind spots are\n\n1) it has an enormous blind spot for young people because they haven’t lived long enough to accumulate calcification even if they already have raging disease going on\n2) not everyone who has advanced disease has calcification\n3) it’s not the calcified lesions that kill people \n\n\n\n“You can be fooled by these tests by seeing a negative burden of calcium. You might think, ‘well this person is free and clear’, but in reality they have tons of soft plaque that is not yet calcified.”\n⇒ The Drive episode with Ethan Weiss discussing CAC among other CVD topics: #52 – Ethan Weiss, M.D.: A masterclass in cardiovascular disease and growth hormone – two topics that are surprising interrelated \n \nCancer—what lab work can tell you, and the future of liquid biopsies [28:00]\nWe start with the question: What drives cancer? \n\nCancer is both a genetic and metabolic disease \nSo by definition cancer cells have mutated and they sort of have this trait that is common to all cancers. \nThe essential condition of cancer is unregulated/dysregulated cell growth ⇒ cells that grow without responding to normal cell cycle signaling\nThere’s a strong immune component to cancer because our immune system is almost always keeping cancer at check and keeping it at bay … So at some point when our immune system starts to lose that battle, that’s when cancer starts to win\n\nMetabolism of cancer\n\nAfter smoking, obesity is the next leading predictor of cancer\nWhy? Peter thinks it’s less about the obesity and more about the metabolic environment that accompanies obesity, i.e. hyperinsulinemia\nThere’s no question that this is a disease that’s heavily impacted by \n\nthe underlying metabolic health of the individual\nthe immune function of the individual, and \nthe ability to acquire mutations and repair them\n\n\nHowever, the metabolic piece is pretty much the only one we can glean anything about from a standard blood test\n\nLabs:\n\nGlucose and insulin \nInsulin primarily being the biggest because it’s a very potent and anabolic growth factor\n\nInsulin, IGF, IGF binding proteins, all of these things factor into cancer \n\n\nGlucose is the preferred fuel of cancer \n\nLiquid biopsies\n\nMost cancers do not arise from inherited genes (maybe 5% do)\nThe majority of cancer result from somatic mutations (mutations that occur to your genes but they’re not necessarily the genes you pass on)\nThe only way to test for that is using these novel technologies that are emerging called liquid biopsies\nLiquid biopsies are blood tests that look for circulating tumor DNA and can tell you how many circulating cancer cells you have and also the tissue of origin (e.g., these are breast cancer tumor cells)\nThese are in the process of some very late stage FDA trials that will likely be available for use in the next year in some sort of investigative capacity \nSo that would mean you’d see breast cancer in the blood long before it’s showing up on any test. \n\n⇒ Previous episodes of The Drive discussing liquid biopsies:\n\n#06 – D.A. Wallach: music, medicine, longevity, and disruptive technologies\n#62 – Keith Flaherty, M.D.: Deep dive into cancer— History of oncology, novel approaches to treatment, and the exciting and hopeful future\n\n“The long and short of it is there’s very little in a blood test that’s gonna tell you if you have cancer. What we instead rely on a blood test to do is at least tell us what your metabolic environment is and how much that’s predisposing you to cancer.”\n \nAlzheimer’s disease—what’s driving Alzheimer’s disease, and what labs can tell you about your risk [33:15]\nWhat’s driving Alzheimer’s disease?\n\nGenetics\nMetabolic health\nVascular health\nInflammation\nToxins\n\n1 | The genetic component:\n\nIt has a strong genetic component\nNot an acquired set of mutations, but rather an inherited set of alleles that puts you at higher risk or lower risk\n\n-Relevant genes\n\nApoE4 is most important in terms of understanding risk\nNext most relevant is TOMM40 – but this may not be an independent risk factor\n\n–Allen Roses\n\nIn 1993, Allen Roses discovered the risk increase for Alzheimer’s in people with the ApoE4 gene\nHe later alerted people to the TOMM40 gene\n\n-Deterministic genes\n\nApoE4 does raise risk but it is not considered a “deterministic gene”\nHowever, a small percentage of AD cases (about 1%) are due to “deterministic” genes\nThe following genes may be “fully penetrant” and therefore “deterministic” which means if you have a mutation in them you WILL get AD:\n\nAmyloid precursor protein (APP)\nPSEN1, and \nPSEN2\n\n\nIn cancer, for example…\n\nThere are a couple things that are CLOSE to being deterministic such as:\n\nAPC with colon cancer\nLynch syndrome\nAnd about 60-70% of women with BRCA1 get breast cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n2 | Metabolic Health component of Alzheimer’s disease\n\n“Metabolic health really matters. It is the common thread that links all of these chronic diseases.”\nHowever, on mortality tables, it doesn’t really show up individually as a huge source of death.\n\n3 | Vascular component to Alzheimer’s disease\n\nThis is a huge component\nSee podcast with Francisco Gonzalez-Lima for more on this\n\n4 | Inflammatory component to Alzheimer’s disease\n\nEnormous component, says Peter\n\n5 | Toxins related to Alzheimer’s disease\n\n“There’s almost assuredly a component that revolves around toxins and other things like that.”\n\nBlood tests for the deterministic genes:\n\nYou can test for the deterministic genes pretty easily (PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP)\nHowever, that’s usually just to confirm a strong suspicion after seeing a strong family history of getting AD\nHistory of AD:\n\nAlois Alzheimer diagnosed the first patient\nIt was a woman in her 50s that had early onset AD and she most likely had one of the deterministic genes\n“And this could be a real tragic case of medical history that our entire understanding of a disease, which is predicated on this incident case, has nothing to do with 99% of the diseases that people actually get.”\n\n\n\nThe punchline when it comes to Alzheimer’s disease: \n\nWe get pretty darn good information from the blood\nWe get the relevant genes\nWe get all the vascular stuff\nWe get all the metabolic stuff\nWe can’t get as much good info about the inflammatory stuff\nAnd we’re pretty bad at getting the toxins because truthfully we just don’t know\n\n“But overall we get a pretty darn good way to handicap someone’s risk of Alzheimer’s disease.” \n \nHealthspan and the physical body—where lab testing fits, the endocrine system, and zone 2 testing [39:00]\nImportant components of the physical body for healthspan:\n\nMuscle mass\nStability\nStrength\nAerobic function\nAnaerobic function\nFreedom from pain\n\nWhere does lab testing fit into all of that? \n\nMostly on the endocrine side\n\nBest example would be testing for hypogonadism \n\nPeople who have low testosterone, for both male or female, AND they have impaired ability to put on muscle mass …  “That becomes diagnostically interesting.”\n\n\n\n\nHypercortisolemia factors into body composition and other things\nMetabolic stuff that factors into that, but the reality of it is that’s much more of a functional thing than a really a laboratory thing. \nBut… Outside of understanding hypogonadism, there’s not a huge amount that we glean in terms of risk stratification there.\n\nLactate testing to find zone 2\n⇒ Previous

doctor)\n#73 – AMA #9: NAD & metformin, fat-burning zone, creatine, estrogenization of men, emergency kit for cold & flu, and more\n\n–What is zone 2?\n\nZone 2 is basically the highest level of exertion that is effectively pure mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation before you start to net accumulate lactate\n\n–Testing for zone 2\n\nPeter has a lactate testing protocol for his patients which involves testing lactate in your blood while exercising\nBeing at ~2.0 mM (or probably just below it at 1.8, 1.9) means you are in zone 2\n\n–Zone 2 is NOT a static thing\n\nPeter notes it’s interesting that his zone 2 on a bike is different than on a rowing machine\nAt the exact same wattage, Peter’s zone 2 watt on the bike produced a lactate of 1.9-2.0 millimolar \nAn hour later he did the same wattage on the rowing machine and his lactate was between 3.4 and 4.1\nYour lactate levels at a given intensity depends on things like how recovered you are, how hydrated you are, whether or not you sick, etc.\n\n⇒ Example…\n\nToday Peter’s bike was 182 Watts at a heart rate of 134 and that was his zone 2\nDays when he’s feeling really good that wattage will be 190 at a heart rate of 135 and that’ll produce the same amount of lactate\nSometimes I’ll be like heart rate 128 and 192 watts will still be the zone 2 of that day\nDays when he’s been sick, even 160 Watts is above zone 2 and his heart rate is through the roof\n\n“So you’re basically using heart rate and wattage to predict where you need to be and then using lactate to confirm it after the fact. . .It’s good for people not to think of zone 2 as static, but something that’s sort of always in flux with respect to where you are physiologically.”\n \nSummarizing the usefulness of lab testing—where it gives great,

is total cortisol at one point in time \nYou really want free cortisol and to be able to sample it over a time series\n\n4 | Fuel partitioning system\n\nThe fuel partitioning system is … \n\nWhat do you do with the nutrients you take in?\nHow do you store them?\nHow do you access them? \n\n\nWe get some of that from blood testing, but I think much of that comes from metabolic testing such as zone 2 testing than other tests that mimic that sort of protocol. \n\nIN SUMMARY\n-We have really good insight into…\n\nAtherosclerotic disease\nDementia risk\nSex hormones\nThyroid

otherwise and/or FH, familial hypercholesterolemia.” \nThe first thing that jumps out is that he does indeed have an elevated Lp(a)\nAn Lp(a) test is one of the five most important blood tests you should ever do, says Peter, and you only need to do it one time\nAbout 1 in 12 people in the population have elevated Lp(a)\n\nThe patient’s LDL-C:\n\nThe LDL cholesterol is elevated at 149 (60th or 70th percentile)\nAnd his primary care physician likely put him on Lipitor specifically because of this finding\nAlthough 10 milligrams is the lowest end of the typically range (10 and 80 milligrams)\n\nApoB\n\nApoB is a far better proxy for risk than LDL-C\nLDL-C is measuring the cholesterol concentration carried within all of the low density lipoproteins\nAnd there’s no question that that’s correlated with outcomes, but not as strongly as either:\n\nnon HDL cholesterol, because that includes the cholesterol of not just the LDL but the VLDL\nBut even more importantly as ApoB\n\nAnd the reason is because ApoB is a marker of all atherogenic particles\nAnything that causes atherosclerosis by definition has an ApoB100 on it ⇒ So that’s an LDL, a VLDL, an IDL, and an Lp(a)\n\n\n\n\nIf someone has high VLDL remnants, for example, they will have high ApoB\nFor this patient, his high Lp(a) means he’ll have a high ApoB\n\nCoronary artery score?\n\nPatient 1 did NOT have a coronary artery score\nAt age 37, he should have a score of zero \nPeter says he would NOT do a test for this on this patient: “It’s not going to change my management. I have a general principle in life which is ‘don’t do diagnostic tests if you can’t explain how the outcome is going to change your management’.” \nBased on his family history and his own lipid history, this guy already needs maximum lipid lowering therapy\n\nWhat determines ApoB levels?\n==> Suggested reading on this topic: Measuring cardiovascular disease risk and the importance of apoB\n–Basically four things determine ApoB levels:\n\nFirst, it’s how well you’re able to clear the ApoB out of circulation\nNext, the other three of the four things are determined by how much cargo needs to be trafficked in the lipoprotein. And those are:\n\n1) How much cholesterol you synthesize\n2) How much cholesterol (or sterol) you reabsorb\n3) The amount of triglycerides (TGs) you have to carry around\n\n\nCholesterol and triglyceride can’t just be carried around in the bloodstream by themselves because they are too hydrophobic\nSo they have to be packaged into things that are water soluble… and those things are called lipoproteins\n“If you want to lower the amount of lipoprotein, the first, second, third strategy is to lower the amount of cargo they have to carry.”\n\nSo that means lowering triglycerides and lowering cholesterol. \n\n\n\nHow cholesterol gets lowered:\n\nReducing the synthesis of cholesterol, or \nReducing the reabsorption of cholesterol\n\n\nNOTE: It does NOT include reducing the intake of dietary cholesterol since that features very little into how much cholesterol you have since most of that is not absorbed\n\nCholesterol synthesis—how it works and how to measure it:\n\nThere are two pathways to make cholesterol\n\n1) One of those paths you have a marker, a molecule called desmosterol, which is the last molecule before you make cholesterol. \n2) And in the other pathway it’s called lathosterol \n\n\nAnd so by measuring lathosterol and desmosterol, you get a sense of how much cholesterol a person makes. \n\n–So looking at this Patient 1…\n\nHe has normal levels of lathosterol and desmosterol\nSo we know he is not a hyper synthesizer of cholesterol\n\n-What statins do and how it impacts this patient…\n\nStatins work by \n\n1) inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, and \n2) the liver, in response to that reduction of synthesis, makes more LDL receptors which pulls more of the ApoB particles out of circulation\n\n\n*Since statins work by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, this patient is NOT going to be a super responder to a statin\n\nCholesterol reabsorption—how it works and how to measure it:\n\nOnce a patient makes cholesterol, it gets trafficked and moved all around the body\nBut a lot of it ends up back in the liver\nIt gets taken out of circulation and \nthen gets put into bile \nIt then comes to a checkpoint in the gut to see if it needs to be reabsorbed\n\nWe have a transporter called the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 transporter that brings cholesterol into the enterocyte\nThere’s a checkpoint inside that enterocyte that determines if they should keep the cholesterol or excrete it\n\n\nIf it’s excreted, it goes out through something called an ATP binding cassette (G5G8 transporter) and it goes out in the GI tract. \n\n-How to measure this process?\n\nWe look at 2 phytosterols (plant cholesterol)  which we do not make:\n\nbeta-Sitosterol\ncampesterol \n\n\nIn this patient…\n\nthey’re actually quite elevated… So what does that tell us? \nIt says that this person is reabsorbing a lot of their own cholesterol\nA patient like this is a poster child for a drug called Zetia (Ezetimibe) because Zetia targets that process\n\n\n\nTreatment plan for Patient 1\n\nFirst thing Peter did in this patient was actually increase his atorvastatin to 20 milligrams\nAnd more importantly, Peter added ezetimibe\n“What I suspect will happen is he will have a significant reduction in ApoB as a result of that.”\nTarget for this patient is going to be an ApoB of about 40 \n\nThis is a very aggressive target because i)  family history, and ii) the Lp(a) and the fact that I know that this is a very bad actor of Lp(a)\n\n\nNOTE: Not everybody that has elevated Lp(a) is it very high risk, but his family history tells me that this is a bad version of Lp(a)\n\n⇒ *ADVICE: Anybody that has an elevated Lp(a) must immediately be screened for aortic stenosis, which is about a 2-4x increase in said patients\nMore resources from Peter on this topic:\n\nPeter’s series of cholesterol articles: The straight dope on cholesterol\n5-part podcast about lipids with Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA:\n\nPart I of V: An introduction to lipidology (EP.20)\nPart II of V: Lipid metrics, lipid measurements, and cholesterol regulation (EP.21)\nPart III of V: HDL, reverse cholesterol transport, CETP inhibitors, and apolipoproteins (EP.22)\nPart IV of V: Statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, niacin, cholesterol and the brain (EP.23)\nPart V of V: Lp(a), inflammation, oxLDL, remnants, and more (EP.24)\n\n\n\n“To me, that’s the fun of medicine, right? It’s like you’re a detective and you never get the full facts. You’re never going to know everything. You’re always dealing with incomplete information. You always have to use converging, triangulating pieces of data to sort of update and refine your estimates of risk.”\n \nPatient case study—familial hypercholesterolemia [59:30]\n*****\nPatient

cholesterol is 285 milligrams per deciliter (that’s all because of their LDL — their VLDL is normal)\nHigh ApoB at 204 milligrams per deciliter\n95th to 99th percentile of LDL-C and ApoB (they are concordant in his case)\nLp(a) and VLDL is completely normal\n\nFirst hypothesis: He has familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) until proven otherwise\n\nFH is a phenotypic diagnosis \nThere is a very, very heterogeneous set of genes that predisposes to it\n\n-How did Peter make this early FH diagnosis?\n\nNormal triglycerides\nHDL-C is slightly elevated\nTotal cholesterol is elevated\nLDL cholesterol is elevated\n\n⇒ Quick plug for the ApoB app by Allan Sniderman\nThe bottom line is this:\n\nFH is the phenotype (primary elevation of LDL and by extension then total cholesterol)\nBut the question is, Why?\nMany cases of FH are due to a defect on the LDL receptor so the patients don’t clear LDL well\nBut when you look at Patient 2…\nPeter sees the highest level of beta-Sitosterol and campesterol he’s ever seen\nIndicating that the FH diagnosis is probably due to a defective ATP binding cassette\nIn other words, the primary driver of this patient’s phenotype is that they’re enterocyte is not able to regulate how much cholesterol they absorb. \nThat means this patient absorbs cholesterol through that Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 transporter and they can’t get any of it out … they just accumulate all of the cholesterol they synthesize. \n\nWhat does this mean for Patient 2’s treatment?\n\nThis is a patient that needs to be treated\nBut if you didn’t see the cholesterol/sterol ratios, you would “hit this patient over ahead with enough statin to kill a horse”\nThis patient needs to be on a statin, BUT… what they need more than anything is to be on ezetimibe\nThis patient’s functional defect is on the reabsorption of cholesterol, and that has to be the primary target of therapy\nThis patient will do very well on a medium dose of a statin combined with ezetimibe \n\nDo all physicians do these types of labs from Boston Heart Diagnostics?\n\nUnfortunately, it’s actually pretty rare that a non-lipidologist would do this lab work for a patient\nAnd the reason is probably because they don’t know what to do with the information\nBut Peter cannot recommend it strongly enough because it helps you to see the primary issue:\n\nTriglyceride synthesis or accumulation?\ncholesterol synthesis?\ncholesterol reabsorption?\nLDL clearance?\n\n\n“If you can’t have a sense of which of those things is out of whack, how can you treat this?”\n\nAnother quick example: \n-A patient with:\n\nHigh ApoB\nlow synthesis\nlow absorption\nhigh triglycerides\n\n“This is a patient for whom your first, second, third line of defense is diet.”\n-Example of high triglycerides\n\nSomebody with a triglyceride of 500 in that situation has a genetic defect on the triglyceride side \nAnd that person needs to be on a fibrate, a type of drug that lowers triglycerides\nBut again, if you don’t have that information because you didn’t do the necessary lab work… how is one able to put the best thoughts forward in terms of the clinical management of these cases?\n\n*More about ezetimibe courtesy of Tom Dayspring:\nIt is not (and never has been from the day it came on the market) off FDA label to prescribe ezetimibe monotherapy to lower LDL-C. Of course lacking an outcome trial, guidelines (being evidence based) do not recommend ezetimibe as a starter monotherapy for LDL.  There have been zero ezetimibe vs placebo or vs statin monotherapy primary, or secondary, prevention trials (other than a very recent geriatric one in Japan in 2019 which still has not been published yet). \nThat trial is “The Ezetimibe Lipid Lowering Trial on Prevention of Atherosclerosis in 75 or Older (EWTOPIA) trial”  It was the first trial to look at ezetimibe alone vs diet to reduce cardiovascular events.  Conclusion: compared with dietary counseling alone, the use of additional ezetimibe for primary prevention among elderly Japanese patients with LDL ≥140 mg/dl and ≥1 high-risk feature reduced CV events, primarily cardiac events, with no difference in all-cause mortality. None of these patients were on statin therapy.   Thus it is incorrect to state ezetimibe monotherapy trials failed or were null (as aside from the Japan trial none were done).\nI think the trials Peter was alluding to were early CIMT trials (such as ENHANCE) where ezetimibe had little effect on IMT progression (an endpoint we now recognize as useless) . The closest monotherapy outcome trial was SHARP – which was a trial of people with significant renal impairment—For year one, it was simvastatin + ezetimibe vs ezetimibe monotherapy vs placebo and starting at year 2 and thereafter it was simvastatin + ezetimibe vs placebo. The reason why it was ethical to use a placebo is that stain monotherapy trials had previously failed to impact outcomes in CKD.  In the SEAS trial (to see effect on aortic stenosis outcomes) it was simvastatin + ezetimibe vs placebo. In post-hoc analysis, the statin + ezetimibe vs placebo did reduce events of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) but not atherosclerotic-related events.\n \nComing up on a future AMA [1:10:30]\nMore case studies that touch on other lab results such as… \n\nOral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) \nUnique metabolic cases that go beyond the obvious but into the subtle stuff like:\n\nHomocysteine\nUric acid\nLiver function tests, and \nMore\n\n\nPeter has some really interesting endocrine cases around testosterone\nAdditionally, we’ve got some male and female hormone questions\nAnd plenty more metabolic stuff and some glucose stuff\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialPrevious AMA episodes that discussed lab tests and reference ranges:  [2:45]\n\n#04 – AMA #1: alcohol, best lab tests, wearables, finding the right doc, racing, and more | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com)\n#11 – AMA #2: the Nothingburger — results from Peter’s week-long fast between two weeks of nutritional ketosis — and answering questions on all things fasting | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com)\n#26 – AMA #3: supplements, women’s health, patient care, and more | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com)\n\nCentenarian studies mentioned: [10:45]\n\nBy Thomas Perls: New England Centenarian Study | (bumc.bu.edu)\nBy Nir Barzilai: The Longevity Genes Project | (einstein.yu.edu)\n\nCentenarians put into 3 categories—The delayers, escapers, and survivors article: Morbidity Profiles of Centenarians: Survivors, Delayers, and Escapers (Evert, et al., 2003) [10:45] \nPeter’s article about heart disease and prevention: When does heart disease begin (and what this tells us about prevention)? | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [23:20]\nCoronary artery calcium scoring was discussed in detail on AMA #5: #50 – AMA #5: calcium scores, centenarian olympics, exercise, muscle glycogen, keto, and more | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [24:30]\nThe Drive episode with Ethan Weiss discussing CAC among other CVD topics: #52 – Ethan Weiss, M.D.: A masterclass in cardiovascular disease and growth hormone – two topics that are surprising interrelated  | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [27:30]\nAfter smoking, obesity is the next leading predictor of cancer: #32 – Siddhartha Mukherjee, M.D., Ph.D.: new frontiers in cancer therapy, medicine, and the writing process | Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) [29:00]\nEpisodes of The Drive discussing liquid biopsies: [32:00]\n\n#06 – D.A.
