  "title": "#185 – Allan Sniderman, M.D.: Cardiovascular disease and why we should change the way we assess risk",
  "content": "Allan Sniderman is a highly acclaimed Professor of Cardiology and Medicine at McGill University and a foremost expert in cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this episode, Allan explains the many risk factors used to predict atherosclerosis, including triglycerides, cholesterol, and lipoproteins, and he makes the case for apoB as a superior metric that is currently being underutilized. Allan expresses his frustration with the current scientific climate and its emphasis on consensus and unanimity over encouraging multiple viewpoints, thus holding back the advancement of metrics like apoB for assessing CVD risk, treatment, and prevention strategies. Finally, Allan illuminates his research that led to his 30-year causal model of risk and explains the potentially life-saving advantages of early intervention for the prevention of future disease.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n<iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"

Book cover Herbert Stary’s Atlas of Atherosclerosis Progression and Regression showing plaque rupture “rings”. Image credit: Amazon.com\n\nPeter asks him why he gave him this last book\n\nAtherosclerosis, it’s a disease in the tissue, yet almost everything that lipid people talk about is in plasma\nOne must understand the natural history of the disease to learn how to construct a strategy to prevent it\n\n\nAlthough much of Allan’s work has been on apoB, the more important part has been on understanding how the natural history of atherosclerosis should direct a prevention strategy\n\nWhat this leads to is that every major guideline in the world bases their selection of subjects for statin prevention on the ten-year risk of disease\n\nThis was a huge step forward in 1980 and 1990\nBut it fundamentally makes prevention of premature disease almost impossible\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems with the 10-year risk approach\n\nWhen one plugs in the numbers to calculate a patient’s risk for any of the risk algorithms, one expects the output to be the patient’s risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but it isn’t \n\nThe American College of Cardiology ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus\n The calculation is driven by the age and sex of the patient\nThings like cholesterol and blood pressure contribute minimally to the actual calculation of ten-year risk\n\nSo if the patient is 35, there isn’t a risk calculator for them\nIf the patient is 40, everyone’s risk is low at age 40\nIt isn’t until age 55 or 60 that the risk gets over the threshold for the American Prevention Guideline treatment\n\nSo prevention really starts at 55 to 60, but almost half of all infarcts and strokes occur before the age of 60\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStary and colleagues established that for the first three decades or so of life, the disease gets a foothold in the artery, but it’s only in the fourth decade that one starts to develop the lesions that can actually precipitate a clinical event\n\nRisk is low, yet the event rate is high — How could that possibly be?\n\n\nAllan says the answer is “stunningly obvious” — Allan has published on how this can be explained; there are 2 problems:\n\n1) There are a ton more people under 60 than over 60; so the rate of events is low, but the absolute number of events is high\n2) Say a patient gets to their 60’s without a cardiac event, but the disease was developing and extending during their 30’s-50’s\n\nSo by the time a doctor tries to prevent an event, the disease is well advanced in the arteries\n\n\nThese are the 2 fatal flaws in the 10-year risk approach\n\nPublished in JAMA Cardiology in 2018, A Long-term Benefit Approach vs Standard Risk-Based Approaches for Statin Eligibility in Primary Prevention  \n\n\n\n\nRisk is a good concept but Allan realized doctors should be selecting people based on causes of CVD\nFor example, if Peter’s risk is 4.1%, what does this number mean?\n\nIs his risk 4.1%?  ⇒ No, it means 4.1 people out of 100 will have an infarct\n\nBut within this category, there is tremendous variance in real risk\nNot everyone is at 4.1; some are higher; some are lower; some are dead on\n\n\n\n\nThe philosopher AJ Ayer (known for logical positivism) was actually darn good on probability\nThere’s a real challenge predicting singular events\n\nOne is either going to have an infarct in the next year or not; it’s not really a probability\n If one algorithm said a patient has a 10% risk and another one said a patient has a 15% or 20%, whether they have an infarct or not, both algorithms were right because they said there was sort of a chance the patient would have an infarct\n\nThere is also a far greater chance that the patient won’t have an infarct\n\n\n\n\nWhen the advice is to treat patients with a risk abouve 7.5%, that means 92.5% of the time nothing will happen to these patients\n\nThat’s not a great incentive for helping people understand what’s truly going to happen\n\n\n\nA 30-year model of risk that focuses on cause of CVD\n\nWhat Allan has done is develop what’s called a casual benefit model\n\nPublished in Clinical Science in 2012, The Causal Exposure Model of Vascular Disease\nPublished in JAMA Cardiology in 2017, The Benefit Model for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease: An Opportunity to Harmonize Guidelines\nWith a measure of non-HDL or apoB, risk can be projected for over 20-30 years\nFor a 30-year-old, the period of time they should care about is up to at least 60\nFor example, this model could predict that a 35-year-old has a 30% chance of stroke before age 65\n\nThis is a number that has meaning\nNow a second calculation can be made to determine how much the risk can be reduced by starting treatment at age 35 or how much the patient would lose by starting at age 45 or age 55\n\n\n\n\nWhen Allan gave Peter the book on atherosclerosis he was starting his own journey on trying to construct an alternative to the present risk model in which with the help of my colleague here at McGill, George Thanassoulis, and Michael Pencina from Duke, and Karol Pencina from Harvard we have done\n\nPublished in JAMA Cardiology in 2017, The Benefit Model for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease: An Opportunity to Harmonize Guidelines\n\n\nPeter remembers from pathology class in med school something the professor said, “No doctor has more experience with what it is to have heart attacks than pathologists because 50% of the people who have a heart attack die on their first heart attack.“\n\nSo 50% of people who have a heart attack, their first presentation is death\nIt’s a very sobering fact\nHe doesn’t think this is true today, but it was 25 years ago\nMaybe now one third of first events are fatal; sobering nonetheless\n\n\nThe textbook went through, in great detail, the pathological staging of atherosclerosis; it was also littered with autopsy sections of coronary arteries from people who had died for other reasons\n\nNotably, many of these people who died from other causes, but their coronary arteries were studied in autopsy, these people were quite young\n\nA 26-year-old male victim of a gunshot wound; or a 27-year-old female who died in a motor vehicle accident, etc.\n\n\nLooking at their coronary arteries, one realizes they already have atherosclerosis; they have oxidized apoB-bearing particles engulfed by macrophages and thickened intima\n\nWhile they may not have calcification in their arteries yet or the types of plaque that would rupture within the ensuing weeks or days or months, they nevertheless had atherosclerosis\nNow what Peter’s professor said some 20 years earlier made sense\n\n\n\n\nAllan remarks that cardiologists are so used to looking at angiograms\n\n“Oh, there’s a LAD lesion” \n\nA lesion in the left anterior descending artery\n\n\n\n\n\n“Well, there’s an LAD lesion, but the whole damn artery is diseased. And when you destroy the normal architecture of the artery, you can’t restore it.” – Allan Sniderman\n\nMuch of statin prevention therapy is to prevent complication of disease not actually prevent disease\nStatins lower apoB particle number; that’s how they work\nWith fewer apoB particles in plasma, fewer get into the arterial wall, fewer get trapped\n\n \nA primer on cholesterol, apoB, and plasma lipoproteins [16:30]\nCholesterol\n\nCholesterol is a fat lipid\nIt’s a critical element in cell structure; it’s in all cell membranes \n\nThe amount that’s in the cell membrane is determinative of the function of the membrane \n\n\nAll the cells in the body can synthesize cholesterol \nOnly the liver can really break it down in any amount and excrete it\nWhen we eat, we absorb cholesterol and fatty acids in the form of triglycerides, and they get resynthesized in the intestine into particles\n\nCholesterol and triglycerides cannot be transported because they don’t mix with water, they’re not soluble\nTriglycerides are fatty acids tacked onto a glycerol backbone; see the structure of a triglyceride in the figure below\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16372\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f2-allansniderman-1024x306.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f2-allansniderman-1024x306.jpeg 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f2-allansniderman-300x90.jpeg 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f2-allansniderman-768x229.jpeg 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f2-allansniderman-1536x459.jpeg 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f2-allansniderman.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 2.

so their LDL cholesterol is the same\n Is there any difference in their atherogenic risk?  YES\n\nThe one with the increased number of particles has higher atherogenic risks because any cholesterol in the artery only got there within an apoB particle\nCholesterol doesn’t just get in the artery, it gets there within an apoB particle (either VLDL or LDL); that gets into the arterial wall and gets stuck there\n\nThis is the cause of atherosclerosis\nThere are lots of things that contribute to multiplying or diminishing the cause, but that’s the cause, sticking of an apoB particle within the arterial wall \nAnd because cholesterol gets in there within the particles, knowing the number of particles is more important even than knowing the cholesterol level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory of measuring cholesterol\n\nAncel Keys (in the 1950s) was potentially one of the first people to measure total plasma cholesterol\n\nIn the late ‘50’s the connection between high cholesterol and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) became known \n\n\nFor example, if someone’s cholesterol measures 200 mg/dL, this tells the sum total of cholesterol in all of the lipoproteins\nStratify people at the bottom 5% and people at the top 5% of total cholesterol level\n\nFor example, at the bottom end are individuals with 100 mg/dL and on the top end are people whose total cholesterol is more than 200 mg/dL\nThere’s a stark difference in their risk of CVD\n\n\nThe amount of cholesterol a person ate does not seem to predict their serum level of total cholesterol\nOther dietary factors, saturated fat intake, for one, seem to predict that difference in cholesterol levels\n15 years later that Fredrickson, Levy, Lees, and others would start to fractionate those lipoproteins and realize that, well, actually there’s different versions (VLDL, LDL, HDL, etc)\n\nPublished in NEJM in 1967, Fat Transport in Lipoproteins — An Integrated Approach to Mechanisms and Disorder\n\n\nLater the nuances that some of the lipoprotein particles contain apoA versus apoB was discovered\n\nApoA is on HDL \nApoB is on: chylomicrons, VLDL, ILDL, and LDL\n\n\n\n \nPathophysiology of CVD and the impact of particle cholesterol concentration vs. number of particles [23:45] \nPeter asks: When did it become clear that there was a discordance between the cholesterol concentration in the LDL particle and the number of LDL particles?\n\nBob Lees had a paper in Science in 1970; he measured LDL apoB (the number of LDL particles) and showed it had no clear (or exact) relation to plasma triglycerides or to cholesterol\n\nImmunoassay of plasma low-density lipoproteins\n\n\nRon Krauss and colleagues (including Sniderman) showed in the John Gofman tradition that there were important differences in the size of plasma LDL\n\nAnd these are related to differences in the amount of cholesterol mass per particle\nPublished in the Journal of Lipid Research in 1982, Identification of multiple subclasses of plasma low density lipoproteins in normal humans\nPublished in PNAS in 1983, Composition and distribution of low density lipoprotein fractions in hyperapobetalipoproteinemia, normolipidemia, and familial hypercholesterolemia\n\n\n\nParticles can be more important than cholesterol for predicting risk of CVD\n\nAllan’s first clinical paper looked at a bunch of patients with coronary angiography; they compared people with clean coronaries to people with diseased coronaries \n\nThere was a little difference in triglyceride \nThere was a difference in cholesterol\nBut there was a marked difference in apoB \nPublished in PNAS in 1980: Association of coronary atherosclerosis with hyperapobetalipoproteinemia [increased protein but normal cholesterol levels in human plasma low density (beta) lipoproteins] \n\nIn collaboration with Peter Kwiterovich from Hopkins\n\n\nThis was one of the first, clinically solid observations showing that particles could be more important than cholesterol\n\n\nSince 1980 even more evidence shows that particles are more important than cholesterol\n\nBut, this hasn’t moved the American guidelines\nThe figure below shows as the concentration of apoB particles in the bloodstream increases, the number of particles trapped within the arterial wall also increases thereby advancing the atherosclerotic process\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16377\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f7-allansniderman-592x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"592\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f7-allansniderman-592x1024.png 592w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f7-allansniderman-173x300.png 173w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f7-allansniderman-768x1328.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f7-allansniderman.png 806w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" />\nFigure 7.

The American guidelines clearly state apoB and non-HDL are better than LDL, but the world has remained.” – Allan Sniderman\n\nAllan doesn’t understand why the lipid world has been so resistant to change\n\nAnd he’s pessimistic that it will change any time soon\nIn Europe, the 2019 guidelines were very pro apoB\n\n\n\n“The evidence from Mendelian randomization, the newer technologies, Mendelian randomization, they’ve just been a slam dunk for apoB.” – Allan Sniderman\n \nHow Mendelian randomization is bolstering the case for ApoB as the superior metric for risk prediction [40:45]\n\nIn the conventional ways of taking things apart with prospective observational studies (like the Framingham Heart Study) there’s a limited amount of the certainty of the conclusions because of confounding that can’t be dealt with\n\nThis study takes measurements at age 20 and then follows someone for the next 30 years\nA lot of things change in 30 years\n\nThe inferences are probable but not causal\n\n\n\n\nMendelian randomization allows one to come a lot closer to causality\n\nFor example, one can identify groups of genes that are associated, where changes in the gene are associated with a little lower cholesterol or a little higher cholesterol \nWhen one lumps together a bunch of those different genes that can have different makeups, one can see fairly substantial differences in cholesterol\nThis allows the study of information on somebody that’s fixed at birth to answer the question, is that associated with a difference in outcome?\n\n\nWhat a number of Mendelian randomization studies have shown is that apoB includes all the information in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and even HDL cholesterol; it sums them\nGeorge Davey Smith (one of the founders of Mendelian randomization) is the author of a number of Mendelian randomization saying apoB incorporates and therefore beats triglycerides and LDL cholesterol \n\nPublished in JAMA in 2017, Association of Genetic Variants Related to CETP Inhibitors and Statins With Lipoprotein Levels and Cardiovascular Risk \nThis is a huge level of information that isn’t even mentioned in almost any of the guidelines\n\n\nThere are caveats in Mendelian randomization\nTo summarize, when following a cohort prospectively, the way the Framingham cohort was followed (or the Framingham offspring or the MESA cohort, or any of these cohorts have been followed), one can take a bunch of people and measure their apoB or their LDL-C or whatever metric, it is that one is trying to determine if it in fact has a causal relationship to the disease of interest \n\nThis cohort can be followed over decades\nIt has been demonstrated that the people with higher apoB, higher LDL-C, higher non HDL-C, and lower HDL-C all have a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis over time\n\n\n\n“It’s hard to say that that’s causal just based on that information, because over the ensuing 20 years that you follow them, they are free to make other choices that may impact those variables of interest and other variables.” – Peter Attia\n\nThe Mendelian randomization attempts to get around that by saying at the time of conception, we all get randomized to a set of genes\nIf one can identify which genes map to which phenotype (and one can figure out the genes that mapped to the phenotype of our interest, namely driving up or down a variable of interest such as apoB) then there’s no worry about the confounders that occur in between, because the genes can’t change\nNow when a difference in outcome is observed, it’s much more likely to be causally related to the phenotype of interest because the gene has not changed that underlies it\n\n\nAllan notes that HDL cholesterol was the total rage because the epidemiological evidence couldn’t be clearer\n\nPeter recalls that the Framingham study demonstrated that low HDL-C was 4 times more predictive of cardiac events than high LDL-C\nAllan agrees that the difference is definitely multiples\nFurther it is known from CETP inhibitors, that one can’t manipulate HDL and change outcomes \nThat’s one of the elements of demonstrating an overall causal relationship\nThe Mendelian randomization shows HDL is not causal \n\nWhereas they also show that apoB and cholesterol are causal\n\n\n\n\nIn the past 10 years, it’s an incredible technical advance in being able to examine questions and look at numbers of people that would be unimaginable in conventional studies\n\nThe Mendelian randomization studies involve hundreds of thousands of people because they’ve got these huge data banks with genes and those numbers can around the confounding of things\nThere are huge numbers, but it’s like any methodology, no method is perfect\nThis one can mislead you too, particularly when you’ve got a sequence of associated variables\n\nFor example, people showed using mendelian randomization (MR) that triglycerides were “causal or associated with increased risk” \nBut when one takes into account the non-HDL cholesterol or the apoB, it disappears\nWhen there is a linked metabolic chain, one has to be careful to go to the end of it, to get to the real actor, not Act One leading… get to the real personae dramatis\n\n\n\n\nPeter notes his surprise that HDL didn’t demonstrate causality (at least at the first order) because there’s no doubt that phenotypically, the high triglyceride and low HDL phenotype is so associated with metabolic syndrome\n\nHigh triglyceride and low HDL make up 2 of the 5 criteria of metabolic syndrome\n\n\nAllan notes that HDL is an incomplete description\n\nIt’s like  describing yourself as six feet tall, not telling the weight, and asking about BMI\n\n\n\n“You cannot characterize any phenotype without the apoB” – Allan Sniderman\n\nHow can the system be evaluated without counting the number of atherogenic particles?\n\nThey could be normal, they could be high or the patient could have a type III\nThere is no phenotype without putting an apoB in there \n\n\nThey’re lipoprotein particles, they’re disorders of lipoprotein particle metabolism\n\nOf course the triglycerides and cholesterol are important; but this information is incomplete without apoB\n\n\n\n \nHypertension and CVD risk [49:15]\nFactors that increase formation of arterial plaque\n\nIn terms of pathophysiology, the apoB bearing particle wreaks havoc in the artery wall many, many years before clinical events are observed\n\nThere are other factors that can amplify or exacerbate this\n\n1) Smoking\n2) Hypertension\n\nDo these factors carry a greater risk for atherosclerosis than apoB?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last 30 or 40 years there have been almost an infinite number of basic science studies on hypertension\nHypertension is having higher blood pressure than what is normal\nWhat strikes Allan is the lack of discussion about the pathophysiology of hypertension\nBut the basic science that goes on in rats, is healthier than ever; and he doesn’t know of anything that’s come out of that basic science that’s been clinically useful in the last 30 years\nThe drugs prescribed to treat hypertension work\n\n“Where is the disease that produces that higher blood pressure? Is it resistance? We don’t have a clue.” – Allan Sniderman\n\nTo Allan, it’s the same thing as much of the debate in lipids about apoB; it can be likened to the drunk looking for the key under the light because this is where the light is, not where he lost the key\nAllan thinks hypertension arises from the loss of elastins in the proximal aorta, and that causes systolic hypertension\n\nHe doesn’t think it’s complicated\nNow, what could accelerate this process?\n\n\nThe literature on hypertension focuses on peripheral arterial tone and complex metabolic studies in sophisticated animal models, as well as some renal studies\n\nIt’s all miasma for him\n\n\n\nMechanism\n\nAllan explains the role of proximal aorta in hypertension as he sees it\n\nThe proximal aorta is elastic; if one looks at a flow curve (a hydrostatic pressure curve) when a patient is young it’s rounded because as the left ventricle ejects blood rapidly into the aorta, the aorta expands and absorbs some of that energy\n\nRecall that wind castle that they’ve mentioned in school, but the energy is partially captured, partially regained; but the wall isn’t battered; the wall can give way\nImagine if those elastic fibers start to go, then the walls stiffen; now when the left ventricle ejects blood, the pressure goes up more rapidly and it falls more rapidly in diastole\n\nThis could be why systolic hypertension occurs while diastolic pressure is normal\n\n\n\n\nHe suggests looking at factors like cardiac output again (which used to be studied way back when) or factors that alter the behavior of the proximal aorta\n\nHe believes these are much more likely to be involved\n\n\nWith hypertension there is a driving force to push particles into the wall\nWith hypertension, the wall thickens up and it gets harder for particles to go through\n\nThe response of the wall changes, and this leads to the increase in blood pressure\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks about damage to the endothelium\n\nAllan doesn’t understand endothelial dysfunction, but he knows the endothelium is critically important\nIt functions abnormally and how that fits into the overall pathology, he doesn’t know\nAllan bets apoB particles are part of the process inducing endothelial dysfunction, but he doesn’t  know that clearly, experimentally\n\n\nDoes it make sense to compare hypertension to apoB?\n\nThey both seem to play a causal role in CVD\nIs one more causal than another or is that a silly question because they’re not binary and static?\n\nAllan thinks this is not the right question\n\n\n\n\nBlood pressure goes up with age; hypertension involves a large part of the population\n\nIt seems that hypertension is becoming part of the aging process\nHumans are lasting a lot longer than we were probably designed to\nThere is this repetitive injury to the proximal aorta, and it gets a little progressively less able to deal with it \n\nSo by the time a person is 50, somewhere around 60% have higher blood pressure; the figures are staggering\n\n\n\n\nDoes ApoB rise with age? Yes, but not that much \nWhen one looks at people at age 35, one can accurately categorize the group they belong to at age 35\n\nIf one is  high at age 35, they’ve got about a 95% chance of staying high; 5% will go out of the high zone; they won’t go low, low\nIf one has high blood pressure at age 35, he would expect anything is going to move them down \n\nThis is why he thinks blood pressure is a good signal for when to start thinking about treating people\n\n\nSome people go from low toward high, but the majority don’t\nFor people with high blood pressure, about 90% remain high\n\n\n\nGender differences\n\nPeter has seen women experience dyslipidemia as they go through menopause; this is something men men wouldn’t experience over that same decade or even five-year transition\nAllan notes that apoB goes up with menopause\n\nHe would like to see more data on this\nThe science has been held back because people don’t measure apoB\n\n\n\n[56:45]\nCurrent trends\n\n The incidence of coronary disease is going up in the last five years\n\nDespite statin therapy\nThat’s due to obesity and diabetes\n\n\nThere are many reasons that treatment is not succeeding as well as it should\n\nThe complexity of the lipid phenotype of the lipid model is part of the answer\nPeter notes that there is a greater and greater portion of the population that is being undiagnosed or being underdiagnosed because doctors are treating their LDL-C \n\nAnd what Allan suggests is that LDL-C is lower than their risk actually is because their apoB is higher\nThis is because doctors are trying to quantify lipoproteins based just on lipids; this is not adequate; it doesn’t capture all the information it should\n\n\n\n\n\n“Trying to quantify lipoproteins based just on lipids is not adequate. You’re not capturing all the information that you should.” —Allan Sniderman\n \nFactors influencing the decision to begin preventative intervention for CVD [58:30]\nFactors that influence the decision for intervention\n\nAllan doesn’t know what it is about smoking that drives risk of atherosclerosis so much\n\nIt does though, and it drives treatment decisions\n\n\nAllan believes people with high apoB levels should be treated because they have a longer-term risk of CVD\nSmoking gets one up in the category to have their life saved; bad behavior gets one closer to having their life saved\n\nIt’s in the risk calculators, see the figure below\nThe risk goes up for a smoker\n\nIt changes the prioritization\nBad behavior increases risk so one gets more medical attention\n\n\n\n\n\n“I think bad behavior is our responsibility to help people deal with, but I don’t think it should put you to the head of the line for preventive therapy.” – Allan Sniderman\n\nPeter would argue that there is not line; anyone who wants preventative therapy should be getting it\n\nAre these resources limited?\n\n\nAllan feels patients are not given the information they deserve \nHe published a paper in Circulation in 2000\n\nThe Expected 30-Year Benefits of Early Versus Delayed Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease by Lipid Lowering\nIt assessed the costs of delaying intervention starting at age 35, 45,  and 55 for patient’s whose non-HDL is low\nThe gains of starting lipid-lowering treatment at age 35 are quite small\nThe gains here are with 35-year-olds who have high non-HDL\n\nPhysiological and epidemiological knowledge suggests about 20% of the population are at high risk at age 35 and should consider intervention\n\n\nPart of the information patient’s need to know is how much is gained now versus how much is lost by waiting\n\nThis is why these methods of calculating benefit are so important\n\n\n\n\nWhat fraction of the population has relatively normal apoB, relatively normal triglycerides, and yet has accelerated atherosclerosis through some combination of yet to be identified polygenic risk factors?\n\nAtherosclerosis can run in families even when there’s no obvious cause\n\nThey don’t have FH (familial hypercholesterolemia)\nThe don’t have Lp(a)\nTheir apoB is around the 50th percentile of the population\nYet, they are disproportionately afflicted at a young age, all having first events before age 60\n\n\nThis question needs more research\nAllan would look at factors that affect the trapping apoB particle within the arterial wall\n\nHe thinks Kevin John Williams from Philadelphia, they’ve done an amazing job in putting this all together\n\n\n\n\nFamily history of CVD does factor in Allan’s decision for intervention; but if the apoB is low he would be less inclined to treat\n\nAn apoB around the 50% percentile in patients with a family history would make him more antsy; higher they are, the more antsy he gets\n\n\nA lot of these decisions at the individual level, actually, aren’t that difficult when one is speaking to a particular patient because they have their own objectives and goals\nMedications have risks associated with them\nAllan doesn’t think we fully understand the relationship of statins and diabetes\n\nStatin therapy is amazing, but it’s not at no cost\nWhen he talks to an individual human being, it’s easier to make clinical decisions individually than to write rules for groups\n\n\n\n \nUsing the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score as a predictive tool [1:03:15]\n\nThe coronary artery calcium score (CAC)\nCoronary calcium is an important step forward in cardiovascular imaging\nIt uses x-ray techniquest to accurately and safely determine whether there’s calcium (bone) in the coronary arteries \nCalcification is a feature of advanced atherosclerosis\nThere’s very strong evidence that people who have coronary calcification are at higher risk of a heart attack or stroke than people who do not have coronary calcification\nThere are several facts to consider:\n\n1) The frequency of a positive coronary calcium goes up as we age (so does the risk of disease)\n\nAll American men by age 60 are at high risk according to current guidelines; women are five to 10 years later\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt age 60 the CAC test isn’t helpful\n\n\nIn most people arteries become substantially transformed in bad ways by age 60\nBut in people younger than 60, this can give extra information that is helpful, should the doctor be on the cusp of treatment\nThis test would be for the patient who wants more information to help them decide about intervention\n\n\n2) There is a problem with the corollary, if the coronary calcium is negative concluding that the patient is okay\n\n\nFrom Allan’s interpretation of the literature, coronary calcification is associated with advanced disease\nWhen people have a heart attack, they don’t just have one little area of their arteries that are abnormal; that’s simply the area where the plaque broke or the endothelium eroded, but the whole artery is diseased\n\nThis means there’s a chance of an event a cm down or a cm closer\n\n\nIf a patient has high apoB, the fact that their coronary calcium is negative doesn’t mean they don’t have a lot of disease and that the disease isn’t developing at a rapid rate; it could be there\nThere’s an argument saying, if the coronary calcium is negative, nothing’s going to happen to in the next five or 10 years\n\nMaybe this is true; but the disease is developing and doctors can’t make the disease go away\nDoctors can modify the effects of the disease, modify the consequences\n\n\n\n\nFor a patient who has been treated and their LDL, cholesterol, and apoB levels are brought low, remember that they still have an artery that is destroyed; they’re going to have a substantial number of events\nJohn Wilkins, and Don Lloyd Jones from Northwestern, they have a paper in JAMA but it’s terribly complicated (they’re Allan’s friends so he can be honest)\n\nPublished in 2021, Novel Lipid-Lowering Therapies to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk\nThey find that waiting for coronary calcium before starting treatment is a bad idea\n\n\nAllan is conservative when it comes to protecting patients\n\nHe wants to give  them the option to have the best outcome possible when they appear to be in danger\nSo he wouldn’t use a negative coronary calcium to change his clinical decision for patients who have high apoB or another cause of vascular disease present\nHe thinks CAC is a good test, but has relatively limited utility for him \n\n\nPeter uses a 2 x 2 matrix to explain this to patients; he considers the patient’s age and CAC score\n\nA 70-year old who has a calcium score of 50 doesn’t tell him much\nAn older patient with a calcium score of 0 who is adamant about not getting treatment; this is an easier decision to accept\n\nIt would be fortunate to have a calcium score of 0 at age 73 with an apoB of 140 mg/dL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the flip side of things is a young patient who has a positive calcium score; really that’s a 4-alarm fire\n\nAllan agree’s, treating this patient is a no-brainer\n\n\nRegardless of apoB, for a patient under 50 who has a speck of calcium in their coronary arteries, that’s utterly unacceptable \n\nAllan agrees; if it’s positive, it’s only going to go up\nPeter notes it says something about the entire system, that might be the one area in the middle of the patient’s left, anterior descending artery where it’s at an advanced stage, and calcium is laid down\n\n\n\n“It’s like looking at the concrete that’s been poured over Chernobyl and trying to infer what’s going on in the 10 miles around Chernobyl. It’s all bad.” – Peter Attia\n\nWhere Peter finds the most challenge is with the group think that says if a person’s calcium score is zero then no treatment is needed\nThis gets back to Allan’s paper looking at the 30-year risk and causal model\n\nPublished in JAMA Cardiology in 2018, A Long-term Benefit Approach vs Standard Risk-Based Approaches for Statin Eligibility in Primary Prevention \nPublished in Circulation in 2020, The Expected 30-Year Benefits of Early Versus Delayed Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease by Lipid Lowering\nHe mentions briefly at the outset the example of a 45-year-old person for whom their apoB is higher than they should be; their calcium score is expected to be zero and it is; here the calcium score didn’t really add much information to decision-making \n\nWhen someone is at 7.8% risk, it’s tough to absorb in a meaningful way\nIf the risk was 30%, 1 in 30, that starts to be truly meaningful\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe challenge of motivating individuals to take early interventions [1:12:30]\n\nHow does a doctor get someone excited about a 5% risk of an event in the next decade, if the patient is 50?\n\nWell, 2 things are wrong  here\n1) The doctor/ patient shouldn’t be thinking about just age 60 (think age 80); a 50-year-old would be expected to live a minimum of 30 more years\n2) 5% is not much to get excited about\n\n\n\n\nPut this risk in a different context, tell a 50-year-old there is a 5% chance in the  next decade they will die on a commercial plane\nHow will they change their behavior?\n\nAllan says he wouldn’t stop flying, because there is a 95% chance he won’t die\nPeter’s point is that 5% is a bigger risk than people realize\nThe treatment of not flying in an airplane for 10 years is far more of a burden than treatment to lower lipids\nRisks can be combated\n\n\nAllan asks what the confidence intervals are on that number of 5%\n\nLet’s say +/- 2%\nAllan asks where he’s seen this number\nPretend it’s at the population level (one can’t have this number for the individual level)\n\n\nAllan’s point is that confidence intervals for risk are never published\n\nWhen scientists get any result, they get the range of possible results to let them know how accurate the prediction is\nIf the number is 5% and the confidence interval is 4.5 to 5.5 by maybe the confidence interval is 0 to 70\n\n\n\n“I’m saying we’ve got an industry that captured clinical care, that doesn’t include error.” Allan Sniderman\n\nPeter agrees, it seems almost impossible to believe that the error or confidence level is not reported\nAllan remarks that doctor’s have become less critical\n\n \nHow medical advancement is hindered by the lack of critical thinking once a “consensus” is reached [1:15:15]\n“This process of forming opinion in medical care, this appeared over the last 30 or 40 years, has damped down the essential element of science, which is, challenge different viewpoints.” – Allan Sniderman\n\nThe contention of ideas\nThe creation of an experiment to say this is the right way\nOr someone with a different view creates a different experiment\nScience is a democratic activity where differing views are legitimate and have a chance to contend\n\nHe’s not saying every crazy theory has an equal, because it doesn’t\n\n\n\nPeter asks “who is the arbitrator of what’s a legitimate differing hypothesis?”\n\nIn science, it’s called the experiment\n\nThat is what’s different about science, an experiment is done to test a hypothesis\nIf the hypothesis is sustained, one can continue to hold the hypothesis\nIf the hypothesis falls, then one must reframe their understanding\nExperiments are a tool to gain understanding\n\n\nExperiments are not as easy as it sounds\n\nMethods could become complicated\nStatistics used to analyze data are complicated\nConclusions drawn may or may not be correct; error occurs\n\n\nWhen Allan was a medical student, the major medical meeting of the year was in Atlantic city and the big professors would have different views and they would argue them out\n\nIt was a contentious open battle\n\n\nThen evidence-based medicine came along\n\nIt has lots of plusses, such as the use of randomized clinical trials\nBut it allowed the belief to develop that knowledge is easy to assess; and it’s not\n\nIt’s not easy to assess experiments all the time\nSome of them are straightforward; most of them actually aren’t\n\n\n\n\n\n“And it’s important that we acknowledge the uncertainty and say, well, maybe there’s another way of looking at this that’s even better” – Allan Sniderman\n\nTools like statins were developed; and there’s very good evidence they can save lives\nThis process of consensus came along saying, this is too complicated for regular doctors, and it is; they don’t have the time to analyze all the evidence\nSo we’ll analyze the evidence for them and write it out in a way that tells them what’s the best we can do now\n\nThere’s a lot of good in that, but there’s potential weakness\nAllan thinks a lot of the weakness is happening because one view becomes the conventional view, and it hangs on longer than it should\n\n\n\nScience is about change\n“If we’re still saying the same things we said 30 years ago, it could be a problem because we should have learned how to say it better, more accurately.” – Allan Sniderman\n\nIn these consensus conferences the recommendations are unanimous\n\nThe Supreme Court isn’t unanimous often; there’s a majority view and a minority view\nIt could turn out that over time the wisdom of the minority view become apparent  \n\n\nAny process where the decisions become larger than the individuals who propose them has a weakness\n\nFor example, the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and about 30 other groups are actually about 100 people\n\nThey’re good people, but cloaked in the anonymity of the group they become impervious to criticism, even when there’s obvious inadequacies\nAnd that’s not science\nIf someone published a paper, someone else can do an experiment and try to overturn the paper or confirm it\n\n\n\n\nBut with the guidelines, they’re the judgement cast in stone until the next group of guidelines\n\nDepending on which people write them, it can influence what one sees\n\n\nPeter would add even more complexity to it, which is if one goes through the critical steps are for the elucidation of knowledge:\n\n\n1) The formation of a hypothesis\n2) Designing an experiment to test that hypothesis\n3) Conducting that experiment\n4) Analyzing the results of that experiment and interpreting it\n\n\nThese are quite discrete steps\nAny one of these steps offers infinite ways to do it wrong and a relatively few great ways to do it right\n\n \nPSK9 inhibitors and familial hypercholesterolemia: two examples of complex topics with differing interpretations of the science [1:20:45] \nTrials of PSK9 inhibitors\n\nFor example, yesterday Peter was discussing lipids with a friend and the FOURIER trial (that looked at one of the two PCSK9 inhibitors) \n\nPublished in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2017\nThe drug is Repatha (generic name Evolocumab) \nThis trial demonstrated that for patients who were on a very high level of statins and had a very low LDLC (their average LDLC was in the neighborhood of 70 mg/dL), over a 5-year period they had a reduction in cardiac revascularization, but no change in mortality\nThe point is, how can these drugs be tolerated? \nWhy are insurance companies paying for these drugs, people using them, doctors prescribing them when there is no demonstration of a reduction in mortality?\nPeter sometimes confuses the ODYSSEY trial (with the other PSCK9 inhibitor) with the FOURIER trial \n\nPhase 3 results of the ODYSSEY trial were published in The Journal of Clinical Lipidology in 2014\n\n\nThese studies were short and on a group of patients who were already heavily statin-ized so Peter thinks it’s a miracle they showed anything at all\n\nThese patients are already walking around with a LDL-C that is 5th percentile of the population then they are given another agent to lower LDL-C to the 1st percentile\nPlus this is a disease that takes at least 4 decades to take hold and they are only studied for 5 years\nIt’s amazing any difference was observed\nIn the ODYSSEY trial though, patients started out with a higher level of LDL-C so there was potentially a greater risk reduction\n\n\nPeter and his friend debated these trials; 2 smart people looking at a well done experiment with reasonably legitimate statistics but they have a different lens for what the disease is and therefore draw different conclusions\n\nHow can consensus resolve that difference?\nHow can this debate be refereed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllan contends, “We can only understand as individuals, there is no such thing as a group understanding, we can’t get beyond ourselves” \n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia\n\nAllan is currently writing a paper about familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)\n\nThere is study showing that patients with this disease who have a genetic abnormality are at  much, much, much, much higher risk than people with similar LDL cholesterol, but without the genetic abnormality\n\nThis study has been accepted by everybody as being well done and decisive, and I mean by everybody\nThis compares 2 patients, phenotypically identical but one  has the genetic abnormality of FH and the other does not have this genetic abnormality\nThis study reports that patients with FH carry a risk not present in patients with the wildtype allele; their risk is 3-5-times increased, or 300%\n\nBoth Allan and Peter find this unbelievable\n\n\n\n\nAllan read read the study many times and finally he thinks they made a mistake in their methodology \n\nThis is what Allan’s current paper is about\n\n\nHe will write up his interpretation and findings and subject it to review and criticism\n\nSince he is saying that every authority in the field is wrong, he thinks his chances are slim that this will receive a positive reception\nBut the error in methodology is so simple and decisive that he thinks he is right \n\n\n\n\n\n“We have to continue to think and discuss with ourselves” -Allan Sniderman\n\nEveryone believed HDL cholesterol until they didn’t\n\nHow many dissenters were there until everybody said it was obvious, there was nothing there\nA review from 2015 discusses the lack of reduction of cardiovascular events after increase of HDL-C (niacin intervention)\n\n\nWe are all human beings; we search for validation, but real science isn’t about that\n\nIt turns out the world is a very slippery thing to get your mind around\n\n\n\n \nDefining risk and uncertainty in the guidelines [1:26:00]\nRisk\n\nRisk is the number of events per standard number of people over a defined period of time\nIf the risk is 5%, that is 1 in 20 per standard group of people\n\nThis is why Allan said risk is low if you’re under 60, the number of events per hundred people is low\n\nBut the number of hundred people is a lot larger than over 60; that’s why the absolute number of events is so high\n\nThis difference in words means a tremendous difference in action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“So a difference of words, tremendous difference in action, because it means I don’t use the 10 ten-year risk model” – Allan Sniderman\n\nThis has been published and reproduced by other investigators, but the guidelines have not changed and that is wrong\n\nGuidelines\n\nWhen Allan looks at the guidelines, he can look at the literature on an issue\n\nHe has enormous respect for people who serve to create the guidelines\nHe can tell you who wrote the guideline\n\n\nThere was a recent guideline from Europe that was negative about apoB\n\nOne paper cited, just one paper and that became the guideline\n\n\nAllan is not talking about throwing out the process \n\nThe process of reviewing knowledge in a group is positive\nHe’s saying to watch out for the process\nIt needs to include a multiplicity of views to avoid bad decisions\n\n\n\n“And if you don’t think we can’t make bad decisions, just look at all the bad decisions the politicians and the business guys make. We’re no different.” – Allan Sniderman\n\nPeter asks about consensus, if a more heterogeneous group of views and greater diversity of priors was brought together then they would probably never arrive at a unanimous decision\n\nAllan sees nothing wrong with this\n\n\nThink of the doctor who has to see 40 patients in a day, will never listen to this podcast, let alone read the show notes of this podcast; they literally just want to know what to do in the moment with the person sitting in front of them\n\nCurrently doctors look to the guidelines which are unanimous, expert run, and revised often enough that it gives one the feeling that they’re keeping up with the science, right? \nEvery five to 10 years, a new guideline will come out\n\nNow it’s going to be this complicated, legal document, that’s like reading the dissents and reading the in-favors\nPeter’s not saying this shouldn’t be done, but how does it translate to the field?\n\n\n\n\nAllan relates that the guidelines now are totally miserable; talk about legal documents\n\nThere is a summary and that’s what doctors typically read, the 1-page executive summary\n\n\nAllan gets this rebuttal all the time, that the guidelines have to be dumbed-down because the doctor who sees 40 patients isn’t going to read it and do anything otherwise\n\nAllan doesn’t think most doctors are dum; he thinks they’re caring and want to do a good job\nAllan thinks the field needs to learn more about how to present information\nHe doesn’t think the truth should ever be compromised because when one does it says “I’ve got to do this in order to get to here”; and that’s not right\n\nUse Afghanistan as an example, “I can’t think of anybody right left or center who thinks that the process getting in and throughout it represents the best efforts of the minds of America” \n\n\nProblems happen when the options have to be boiled down to get a one-liner\n\nA one-liner is not real life\n\n\n\n\n\n“And if we’re going to learn to make decisions that are to present information with our patients we’re going to have to learn how to deal with doubt, that’s what it’s all about” – Allan Sniderman\n \nMaking clinical decisions in the face of uncertainty [1:31:00]\nDealing with uncertainty \n\nPeter notes that doctors are not trained to be comfortable with uncertainty\n\nAllan thinks they are; this is what medicine is all about\n\n\nPeter concedes that uncertainty is acceptable for things that can’t be measured\n\nTake for example a a surgeon in the ER evaluating a patient for appendicitis long before the days when everyone had a CT scan (in the ‘50’s  and ‘60’s)\nA purely clinical diagnosis is needed\nThe surgeon knows that 7% of people in their lifetime are going to have appendicitis\nThe pre-test probability on this person in the ER is probably much higher than 7% because they are presenting with the signs and symptoms of appendicitis \nThere’s an asymmetry in the decision; 2 wrong decisions can be made here: operating on the person without appendicitis and not operating on the person with appendicitis\n\nDecision making has to be calibrated around that uncertainty so that one mistake is more likely than the other\nMost physicians are very good at doing this\n\n\nSomehow that doesn’t translate into the type of uncertainty he thinks is necessary to do what Allan suggests\n\nWhich is rather than give people a unanimously agreed upon consensus that is so distilled down to simplicity that it borders on being incorrect, present a range of thoughts on the subject and acknowledge that ones doesn’t know which is correct\n\n\n\n\nAllan notes the differences in audience: practicing family doctor, practicing internist, academic internist (they are experts in the field)\nAt a minimum there needs to be a range of opinion in the experts in the field\n\nAllan doesn’t think this is currently the case\n\n\nWhen there is doubt, alternate views should be published\n\nHe’s not sure this is currently the case\n\n\nPeople write about weak recommendations but they are also always unanimous\nWhat happens to discussion with 5 people in a room? Doctors and experts are no different\n\nThe one with the loudest voice can carry the day \nThe one who claims the greatest expertise in the area can carry the day\nThis is how a document is produced that is difficult to read\nThe documents read like they did 20 years ago, with minor modifications\nThis is wrong\n\n\n\n“What’s our problem, who are we here for? Ourselves, or our patients and the truth” – Allan Sniderman\nThe need for better communication of complex ideas\n\n\n\nAllan thinks things can be written clearly so people [doctors] can read and make informed choices\n\nAt the end of the day, what the current state of the guidelines are sayings is that “people are too stupid to make a real choice” \n\nAllan thinks there is a better way\n\n\n\n\nWhen Allan has treated patients and made recommendations, were they always the right ones? Of course not. \n\nThey were what he thought was best to advice\nHe can’t claim they were always right\n\n\nBut in knowing that he could be wrong, he calibrated the safest way through for the patient\n\nAlgorithms can help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when doctors treat just by algorithms, then that isn’t clinical medicine\n\n\nAdvanced healthcare professionals can take the algorithms, and work within them and around them, and everybody’s doing a good job\n\n“But we’ve got to respect the fact that our understanding is limited. And that science requires different views to contend equally. And then we need to write the truth.” – Allan Sniderman\n \nHow the emphasis on consensus and unanimity has become a crucial weakness for science and medicine [1:35:45]\nProblems with consensus when understanding is limited\n\nPeter asks if he’s seen an acceleration of forcing function around a uniformed voice\n\nThe past 18 months with COVID, has really amplified what Allan’s describing\nPeter thinks there are lots of dissenting views out there for how COVID could be managed, the potential efficacy for repurposed drugs\nTruthfully, he’s struggled to wade through the literature on this stuff\n\n\nOne can always find somebody who’s made it their mission to understand how this drug or that drug, or this intervention or that intervention, is the solution to the problem\n\nThere’s no denying that such people have been pretty roundly silenced before this\nIt begs the question, should the field be paying more attention to these views? \nAnd when do these views become so fringe and marginal that they’re actually harmful?\n\nAllan agrees, fringe views can become harmful\n\n\n\n\nAllan contends that the first level of discussion should be amongst experts \n\nImportantly, it is here that views that are so divorced from experimental evidence, that they’re not serious views can be called out\n\n\nAllan is not talking about legitimizing any possible view because it’s a possible view\n\nHe is saying that people were pointing out different aspects of a complex problem, and they might put a little more emphasis here, but the result would be that everyone understands more clearly that there are a series of choices involved, and it’s challenging to go through them\n\n\nHere’s an example of a decision, made in real time, that’s a real challenge – in Canada, there was a much longer period between the first and second COVID vaccination\n\nSo more people got their first dose before the second one was given out\nNo one can be sure this is the right decision in the moment, but it has to be made and dealt with\nThe decision was made in the open, so everyone knew what was being done\nAllan is good with that process, because he knows what happening, and the outcome can be assessed\n\nHe’s not good with someone just shrieking\n\n\n\n\nAllan’s against silencing debate; he doesn’t buy the argument that “because we can’t have somebody shrieking, we can’t have any debate. That’s wrong, that’s totally wrong” \n\nThis leads to mistakes happening where they don’t have to happen\n\n\nThe responsibilities doctors have to make recommendations to their patients are so awesome, there is a need for doctors to be humble and say to each other “okay, give me your best shot, I’ll give you my best shot; we’re colleagues, we’re not enemies” \nAllan disagrees with lots of people because he has a scientific viewpoint, but they’re not his enemies\n\nThere are have ways of discussing this\n\nIf he’s in the room, he can say, “hey, you said that, I’ll show you line 26 in your paper, which contradicts you; and he has to respond in front of other people” \n\n\n\n\n\n“That’s what I believe in; the testing of the argument in a jury of your peers” – Allan Sniderman\nLess discussion of alternate views\n\nThe culture in science is being watered down\n\nIt’s not the same today as it was 30 years ago\nAllan thinks this is the crucial weakness\n\n\nAs he judges by the product coming out of the committees forming guidelines, discussion of differing viewpoints inside the room is not occurring \nPeople get attached to views because there’s emphasis on consensus and unanimity\n\nPeople may not want Sniderman in the room because he’s going to argue for apoB\nAllan contends they can deal with him; he’s not hard to deal with\n\nThey can say, “okay, I heard you, but here’s what’s wrong with your argument” \n\nNot what’s wrong with “you personally” \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks what has changed to make ideas more personal\nAllan thinks people are invested\n\nPeople used to become known for their own science; now if someone is on the guidelines, that’s their science\nOne becomes prominent because they are on the guidelines, not that they did the science\n\n\nThere is so much science that’s done\n\nClinical trials for example; they are wonderful, but they are limited tools\n\n\nAllan thinks the composition of the committees needs to be re-examined\nHe thinks one should be able to criticize what comes out\n\nFor example, apoB is Allan’s thing\nHe wrote a critique of the 2018 American Guidelines\n\nPublished in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology in 2019, Did the ACC/AHA/AACVPR/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/APhA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA cholesterol guidelines get apoB right?\nHow many references in the guideline were there on the comparison of apoB and LDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol?\n\n4, 2 from Allan and 2 from an opposing group\n\n\nThis is just 1 issue; the guidelines dealt with a whole bunch of issues\nThis is not adequate; it wouldn’t get a passing grade in school\nSpace is not the limit for dealing with these issues anymore; anything can be put on the internet for those who want to read it\n\n\n\n\nWhat is reprehensible to Allan is not knowing what going on inside the room where the guidelines are made\n\nWas there a full discussion?\nThis process didn’t occur when he was younger; contending ideas could contend more easily\n\n\n\n \nFactors holding back the advancement of apoB for assessing CVD risk, treatment, and prevention strategies [1:41:45]\nApoB didn’t make it in the guidelines\n\nHe doesn’t think apoB is going to be utilized because there is a group of people who just aren’t interested, and this is sad\n\nThe guidelines present it as a cost issue\nBut apoB bills the insurance company for $4 and the cash pay is $2.50\n\nThis is not a cost issue but an awareness issue on the part of physicians\nThe guidelines must have failed to actually look at the cost\n\n\n\n\nAllan feels that criticism of the guidelines are not accepted by the community, “because the guidelines are the guidelines” \n\nPeter replies that his next paper can be a survey of the laboratory cost of apoB and the average Medicare reimbursement rate across the US\n\nIs this a valuable exercise?  \nAllan thinks it is\n\n\nAllan did a cost analysis on apoB, “I think using a charge of $10, and looking at the cost of care; and I think it contributed 0.01% of the cost of care, something like that, okay?” \nPeter thinks that the concept that at $10 test changes the cost of care is idiotic\n\nThe US is spending infinitely more than it should (and more than anyone else) on healthcare \n10 years ago in the United States, our healthcare spending was $7,000 per person per year; he doesn’t see how it’s less than $10,000 per person per year today in the US\n\nEven if the apoB test cost $100 (which is 20-times the actual cost), so what?\nAtherosclerosis is the number one killer of men and women; it kills women at a rate that is more than 10 times that of breast cancer\nAllan agrees, and this is his frustration, his sadness\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American College of Clinical Chemistry, the European Clinical Chemists, have a series of reports saying apoB can be measured more accurately than LDL cholesterol or non-HDL cholesterol, no question\n\nAllan’s review of this topic published in 2021, Update on apolipoprotein B\n2019 European Guidelines 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk\n\n\nIs that in any of the guidelines, accuracy of measurement? No. \n\nAllan relates this is what is hard to deal with, “when you say you’re criticizing the guidelines, maybe it’s just you, who are you? You’re a nobody, which is true.” \nBut this is a laboratory test; surely, the quality of the measurement is something that should be mentioned\n\n\n\n“The diagnosis of type III, can’t be done without apoB. So any hypertriglyceridemia patient needs an apoB, not done, not mentioned type III.” Allan Sniderman\n\nAllan feels that his work won’t help people and this makes him sad\n\nPeter replies, “For a guy who understands uncertainty, and probability, and risk, you’re using awfully black and white language right now. “It’s not going to happen,” with what certainty can you say that?” \n\n\nPeter relates this to a beautiful story about a guy hitting a stone\n\nThe mason who’s hammering away on the stone for 10,000 strikes, and on the 10,001st strike when he hits the stone, it finally fractures. Now, to the person watching it, it was that 10,001st strike that fractured the stone. But of course, the stone mason knows that it was that strike, plus the 10,000 that came before it.\n\n\n\n“And so you just have to accept the non-linearity of the advancement of knowledge” – Peter Attia\n\nPeter thinks Allan is too close to this issue to see this\nFurther, at the end of the day, these consensus statements are largely political\n\nThey’re more based on: who someone is, and who they know, and how long someone has been on the committee, rather than the strength of the evidence\n\n\nPeter thinks the truth generally wins in the end, in science\n\nHe wouldn’t be surprised if in 10 years (or so) everyone will look back on this like HDL-C\nIt wasn’t long ago that people thought HDL-C was everything\nToday, thanks to CTAP trials (clinical trial advisory panel), the MR’s, people know:\n\na) HDL-C is much more complicated than we ever thought\nb) This is probably not something we should be trying to manipulate in an effort to improve outcomes\n\n\n\n\nAllan hopes Peter is right, he will pick himself up and keep fighting\nTo quit when one has a new observation that is different or startling is wrong\n\n“Part of this is for yourself just to see, can you understand what looks like chaos? Is there any pattern to what looks like there’s no pattern?” – Allan Sniderman\n\nHow does blood sugar and lipids combine to hurt us?\n\nAllan feels privileged to look at these questions and publish his thoughts in a manuscript; so few people ever have that privilege\nPublished in JAMA Cardiology in 2016, The Enigma of Glucose and Lipid Metabolism\n\n\nPeter has known Allan for over 10 years, and he thinks one of Allan’s strengths is his insatiable curiosity about things that are “theoretically outside of your lane”\n\nThey have exchanged many emails about insulin resistance as well as everything related to lipids\n\n\nHe thinks part of Allan’s success is the breadth to which he has thought about this problem\n\nThis is why Allan has been able to spot patterns that are not obvious to others\n\n\n\n \nAdvantages of a 30-year risk assessment and early intervention [1:50:30]\n\nThe Framingham risk calculator takes into account: age, smoker, HDL-C, blood pressure\n\nThis gives a 10-year risk\nIf the 10-year risk is below 5% there is no need to treat; the gist of it is to carry on as normal\n\n\nPeter practices medicine in a very different way because he has a different goal\n\nHis objective is for a person to live as long as possible, disease-free\nHe is also influenced by people like Allan who have taught him how long it takes for this disease to take hold\n\n\nConsider this analogy, imagine there was a calculator that told you how much money you should be saving for retirement, but it could only predict 10 years into the future\n\nIt wouldn’t be a very useful tool, because a 30-year old isn’t going to be retired in 10 years\n\n\n\nHow Allan came to the 30-year model\n\nThe length of this model is partially utilitarian; 30 years was the longest stretch for which they had reliable data\nThe period of uncertainty is greatest between age 30 and 55 or 60\n\nThis is  where the 10-year falls down\n\n\nHe originally used models based on 10-year risk and saw that these were going to miss most premature disease\n\nIf one simply lowered the risk, instead of 5% use 2.5%\nThe problem is, this is not cost-effective\nThis is multiplying the number one needs to treat more than if one starts off with the cause\n\n\nNow categorize patients by apoB or non-HDL cholesterol\n\nHigh apoB is about 25% of the population\n\nOver 30 years, this group has a 30% event rate\nThis is a lot; it’s not just the apoB that’s doing it\nOther drivers are: age, weight, blood pressure\n\n\nApoB or non-HDL cholesterol can be measured with much less error than the risk can be predicted\n\n\nThe variable that Allan knows, that Michael Pencina calculated, count for about 20% of the variance in risk\n\nThat’s a small number\n\n\n\nCommunicating risk and intervention options to patients\n\nFrom a utilitarian perspective, by stretching out and using the idea of cause and precision of measurement, Allan can group patients\n\nHe can then present a patient with what is known about the group, and they can make their decisions\nSome patients say “thank you, I’ll pass”; they’ll come back in 6 months or a year and he can have the same discussion again\n\nAllan didn’t lose anything\nThe patient has lost that time, but these decisions that can be revisited\nPatients are free agents; they can start and stop therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s up to us to present our arguments and continue to present them as we frame them to… what we think is their best interest, and the best we can do” – Allan Sniderman\n\nAllan maintains contact with his patients; he makes sure they know they can change their mind\n\nHe can show them progress\nIf their apoB started at 120 and went down to 60, he knows they’re taking the medication\nPatients can appreciate the extent of the change that has occurred; and this works\n\n\nPeter finds it helpful to explain that nonlinearity is not innate to us \n\nThis is not intuitive to somebody who hasn’t fiddled with numbers a lot or spent time looking at things that compound \nEven if one were just to look at a risk-based model that was short-term, there’s a significant benefit to reducing risk from 4% to 2% over a decade\nEven though that might only mean there’s a 2% risk reduction over the next decade, the amount that amplifies over 2, 3 and 4 decades is amazingly counter-intuitive, just in the way it is, when one thinks about saving for retirement\n\nIf one is 30-years-old when they start saving for retirement and they have an option to generate a return of 7% and another options that generates a retire on 9-10%, this will not yield an enormous difference by the time they are 40, but it does by the time they are 70\nDo the math and see how easily one can literally double the  nest egg based on a relatively small change upfront\n\n\n\n\n\n“So I think that’s also part of the issue here is, just understanding what compounding does, and how it works in your benefit when you’re talking about investing. But understanding how it works against you, when you’re talking about a disease like atherosclerosis.” – Peter Attia\nThe advantage of early intervention\n\nAllan agrees, starting earlier pays off later\nWhen one begins later this is essentially an effort to modify the disease that’s already present\nWhen on begins early, this actually stops the disease from developing\n\nStopping a lesion from developing is 100% success\n\n\n\n“Trying to treat, modify through one process, a complex set of outcomes at this end, much less likely to succeed. So stopping disease is perfect prevention.” – Allan Sniderman\n\nApoB is a causal driver of atherosclerosis; realize it’s necessary but not sufficient\n\nPeter thinks this is important because \nNecessary but not sufficient, creates a lot of confusion in medicine, doesn’t it? \n\nNecessary, means, there has to be apoB particle traffic a lipid into an artery wall, and without it, atherosclerosis doesn’t develop\nSufficient, means, if this is the only thing to happen then atherosclerosis occurs\n\n\nApoB alone is not sufficient for causing atherosclerosis\n\nPeter knows tons of patients who’ve made it to their 90s with high apoB and don’t have disease\n\n\n\n\nFrom a prevention standpoint, it’s easier to go after something that necessary because blocking that is helpful\n\nComparatively, once the disease has already taken hold, the problem is multifactorial and involves slowing the advancement of disease\n\n\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialPeter has written about Allan Sniderman:\n\nThe straight dope on cholesterol – Part VIII | Peter Attia, peterattiamd.com (June 26, 2012) |  [1:30]\nThe straight dope on cholesterol – Part IX | Peter Attia, peterattiamd.com (July 12, 2012) |  [1:30]\nWhen does heart disease begin (and what this tells us about prevention)? | Peter Attia, peterattiamd.com (June 27, 2016) |  [1:30]\nMeasuring cardiovascular disease risk and the importance of apoB | Peter Attia, peterattiamd.com (December 22, 2019) |  [1:30]\n\nEpisodes of The Drive podcast that mention Allan Sniderman: \n\n#03 – Ron Krauss, M.D.: a deep dive into heart disease | The Drive hosted by Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) | [1:30]\n#19 – Dave Feldman: stress testing the lipid energy model | The Drive hosted by Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) | [1:30] \n#20 – Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part I of V: an introduction to lipidology | The Drive hosted by Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) | [1:30]\n#21 – Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part II of V: Lipid metrics, lipid measurements, and cholesterol regulation | The Drive hosted by Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) | [1:30]\n#22 – Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part III of V: HDL, reverse cholesterol transport, CETP inhibitors, and apolipoproteins | The Drive hosted by Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) | [1:30]\n#23 – Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part IV of V: statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, niacin, cholesterol and the brain | The Drive hosted by Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) | [1:30]\n#24 – Tom Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA – Part V of V: Lp(a), inflammation, oxLDL, remnants, and more | The Drive hosted by Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) | [1:30]\n#52 – Ethan Weiss, M.D.: A masterclass in cardiovascular disease and growth hormone – two topics that are surprising interrelated | The Drive hosted by Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) | [1:30]\n#129 – Tom Dayspring, M.D.: The latest insights into cardiovascular disease and lipidology | The Drive hosted by Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com) | [1:30]\n\nBooks by Sniderman that Peter referenced: \n\nApoB in Clinical Care by  Jacqueline de Graaf, Patrick Couture, and Allan Sniderman (2015) | [5:00]\nAtlas of Atherosclerosis Progression and Regression (Encyclopedia of Visual Medicine Series) by Herbert C.

In 1971, he went to the University of California at San Diego to study lipoprotein metabolism with Dr. Daniel Steinberg. He returned to McGill and, with the passage of time, became the Edwards Professor of Cardiology and a Professor of Medicine at McGill University.\nWith colleagues within and outside McGill, he began and has continued a series of studies, which identified the commonest dyslipoproteinemia associated with coronary artery disease- hyperTg hyperapoB. Study of the pathophysiology of hyperTg hyperapB led to studies of the regulation of hepatic apoB secretion and the uptake and release of fatty acids by adipose tissue. He has conducted an extensive series of epidemiological studies, which have demonstrated apoB to be superior to LDL-cholesterol as a marker of the risk of vascular disease. His current research interests are: to understand the regulation of plasma LDL, to create simplified but advanced diagnostic algorithms to recognize and treat those with and those at high risk of vascular disease, and to develop new models to determine the absolute value of different strategies to identify and treat those at risk of vascular disease.\nDr. Sniderman, father of five, grandfather of four, is a committed, but not very skilful, golfer. His most joyful moments have come from learning with his students and colleagues.\nAllan D. Sniderman, MD, is the Edwards Professor of Cardiology and Professor of Medicine at McGill University. He is Director of the Mike Rosenbloom Laboratory for Cardiovascular Research at Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2009.
