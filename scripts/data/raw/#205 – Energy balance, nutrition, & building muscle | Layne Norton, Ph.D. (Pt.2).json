  "content": "Check out more content from Layne Norton, Ph.D.:\n\n\n\n(May 24, 2021) #163 – Building muscle, losing fat, and the importance of resistance training\n(May 2, 2022) #205 – Energy balance, nutrition, & building muscle\n\n\n\n\nLayne Norton holds a Ph.D. in nutritional sciences and is a physique coach, natural bodybuilder, and previous guest on The Drive. In the first half of this episode, Layne dives deep into the topic of energy balance, including the role that macronutrients and calories play in weight loss. He describes how many people struggle with tracking food and calories on their own across a variety of diets and how all of this can impact nutritional habits and behaviors. In the second half of the episode, Layne discusses the importance of protein and weightlifting for improving one’s body composition and increasing muscle mass. He explains how he would prescribe different training and nutrition programs for two hypothetical clients—a 50-year-old female who is entering menopause and wants to improve her health, and a 40-to-50-year-old male who wants to maximize muscle mass. Additionally, Layne discusses a number of supplements that could potentially benefit a training program including whey protein, branch chain amino acids, creatine, nitric oxide boosters, and more.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n<iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-Ltg1dl2jM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe>\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#205 - Energy balance, nutrition, & building muscle | Layne Norton, Ph.D. (Pt.2)\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#205 - Energy balance, nutrition, & building muscle | Layne Norton, Ph.D. (Pt.2)\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#205 - Energy balance, nutrition, & building muscle | Layne Norton, Ph.D. (Pt.2)\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nDefining energy balance and the role of calories [2:30];\nDefining a calorie, whether they are all created equal, and how much energy you can extract from the food you eat [8:00];\nFactors influencing total daily energy expenditure [12:15]:\nThe challenge of tracking energy expenditure accurately, and the thermic effect of different macronutrients [23:30];\nChallenges of sustained weight loss: metabolic adaptation, set points, and more [34:45];\nWeight loss strategies: tracking calories, cheat meals, snacks, fasting, exercise, and more [40:45];\nSitting in discomfort, focusing on habits, and other lessons Layne learned as a natural bodybuilder [52:15];\nCommonalities in people who maintain long-term weight-loss [1:01:15];\nDoes a ketogenic diet result in greater energy expenditure?

And what does this mean in different diets? \nWe also speak about the struggle people have with tracking food and calories on their own across a variety of diets and how all of this can impact someone’s nutritional habits and behaviors\n\n\n2) The importance of protein in weightlifting through two different hypothetical case studies\n\nThe first is Layne’s work with a 50-year old female who wants to improve her health through nutrition and exercise\n\nShe was more interested in cardio than lifting weights\n\n\nThe second is a 40-50-year old male who want to focus on maximizing muscle mass\nThese 2 cases are illustrative of what many people war going though\n\n\nWe end this conversation by looking at a number of supplements, including whey protein, branch chain amino acids, leucine specifically as one of the branch chain amino acids, creatine, and nitric oxide boosters\nLayne is a bodybuilding figure and physique coach, a natural pro-body builder, and a professional powerlifter\nHe received his undergraduate degree in biochemistry and a Ph.D in nutritional sciences from the University of Illinois\n\n \nDefining energy balance and the role of calories [2:30]\n\nMost people think energy balance is about tracking calories in and calories out\n\nIf I burn 250 calories a day and eat 2000 calories then I should lose 1 lb a week\nWhen this doesn’t happen they say, “this doesn’t work”, and there’s a lot of different reasons for this (we’ll come back to later)\n\n\nEnergy balance is calories in versus calories out (energy consumed and energy spent)\nWhat is energy?\n\nA lot of people say calories don’t exist, you can’t see them under a microscope\n\n\nWe’re talking about energy stored in the chemical bonds of food\n\nWhen food is broken down these molecules go through metabolism: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (shows in the figure below)\n\nEnergy is liberated in these cycle but captured mostly as ATP\nATP is our high-energy phosphate\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17884\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f1-laynenorton2-1024x731.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"731\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f1-laynenorton2-1024x731.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f1-laynenorton2-300x214.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f1-laynenorton2-768x548.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f1-laynenorton2-1536x1097.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f1-laynenorton2.png 1658w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 1. Metabolism: glycolysis and the Krebs cycle  Image credit: Wikimedia Commons\nHow energy is stored\n\nBut you can’t store a bunch of ATP because it is an unstable molecule\nWe have evolved to store fat in adipose tissue; this is a store of excess energy\nYou can store some energy in glycogen\nLayne argues that you can’t really store energy as protein\n\nSome claim that you can break down lean tissue but to him this is like saying, “Let’s build a house so it’s a reservoir for wood”\n\n\nThe contribution of glycogen to your relative energy stores, it’s actually really small\n\nAbout 1500 to 2000 calories of energy\n\n\nSo your adipose tissue is by far the biggest energy store \n\nIt’s economical for space because you can fit a large amount of lipid/fat in a small area\nIt’s energy dense \nIt’s relatively easy to convert fat to ATP\n\n\nGlycogen has to track with a lot of water; it’s not an efficient way to store energy\n\n \nDefining a calorie, whether they are all created equal, and how much energy you can extract from the food you eat [8:00]\n\nCalories are literally a measurement of energy \n\nIt’s just a unit of measurement\n\n\nWhen people ask, “Aren’t all calories created equal?” That’s like saying, “Are different notches on your speedometer different?” \nThink of calories as the energy stored in chemical bonds that can be transferred through various metabolic processes\n\nMetabolism is simply trying to capture the metabolizable energy in food\n\n\nOne important caveat— not everything in food is metabolizable, especially with regards to fiber and specifically insoluble fiber \n\nIt used to be thought that insoluble fiber can’t be digested at all, that it contributes zero calories\nNow there is some evidence that our gut microbiome can extract some calories from insoluble fiber\n\nWork by Suzanne Devkota shows this, maybe 1-4 calories per gram \n4 calories per gram is the normal amount found in carbohydrates \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood component\nCalories/ gram\n(or kcal/g)\n\n\nPolyols (sugar alcohols, sweeteners)\n2.4\n\n\nOrganic acids\n3\n\n\nCarbohydrate\n4\n\n\nProtein\n4\n\n\nAlcohol (ethanol)\n7\n\n\nFat\n9\n\n\n\n\nSo the big C (calorie) = 1000 little c (calories) or kcal (kilocalories)\n\nMost people say they eat 2000 calories but in realities this is 2000 kcal\n\n\nA calorie is defined as the energy needed to heat 1 gram of water from 14.5 to 15.5-degrees Celsius at 1 atmosphere\nNormally we would think of a joule as a unit of energy\nIt’s also important to point out the conservation of energy as it changes forms\n\nThe energy in food is stored in its chemical bonds (chemical energy)\nThis is turned into electrical energy via the electron transport chain (shown in the earlier figure)\nThen we turn it back into chemical energy with the generation of ATP (at the end of the electron transport chain)\n\nADP + Pi + free energy → ATP + H2O\nThe phosphate bond created between ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) stores energy\nThis energy is transferred to a hydrocarbon with the production of fatty acids; reactions are coupled to ATP hydrolysis to transfer energy to another bond\nATP hydrolysis releases energy, ATP + H2O → ADP + Pi + free energy\nCarbon-hydrogen bonds are the most energy dense bonds in our body, more so than carbon-oxygen bonds \nFatty acids are long chains of carbons and hydrogens; this is why fatty acids have more calories per g than carbohydrates\n\nCarbohydrates have more oxygens; see the figure below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17885\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f2-laynenorton2-1024x469.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f2-laynenorton2-1024x469.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f2-laynenorton2-300x137.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f2-laynenorton2-768x352.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f2-laynenorton2-1536x704.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f2-laynenorton2.png 1668w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 2. Comparing the composition of a fatty acid to the carbohydrate glucose. Image credit: Wikipedia\n\nFats, through beta-oxidation are broken down in 2-carbon units to directly create Acetyl-CoA which goes directly into the Krebs cycle\nFor glucose, there’s a lot more involved to generate ATP\nGlucose does have benefits in terms of the amount of oxygen required [is less] to generate the same ATP\nPeter notes, “you can really liberate different amounts of energy from the same foods, depending on many things, but presumably based on your gut microbiome. That’s probably one of the things that’s going to create a pretty sizable delta when it comes to how much food you’re capturing. In other words, how much of that chemical energy you are able to recoup and repurpose into electrical energy.”\nLayne agrees, there is evidence that the gut microflora in people prone to obesity are better able to extract energy from the foods they eat\n\nThis could be reverse causation, that the diet these obese people eat causes these types of gut microfloa to grow and so forth\nYou have to be careful about establishing correlation versus causation\nIt is possible to assess how much energy is lost in fecal matter\n\nIt’s usually 5-10%; this accounts for 95% of people but there is variation\n\n\nSo for the vast majority of people, differences in calories extracted by gut microflora isn’t going to cause a significant difference (only for a few outliers)\n\n\nThere is some variability in the amount of energy you can extract from the food you eat\n\n \nFactors influencing total daily energy expenditure [12:15]\nBasal metabolic rate (BMR)\n\nThe BMR is usually about 50-70% of the energy people expend per day\n\nThis is basically the cost of keeping the lights on\n\n\nBMR can be measured by putting someone in a metabolic chamber and having them lie there awake but not moving\n\nThis is slightly different from the energy expenditure while sleeping (the resting metabolic rate, RMR)\n\n\nWhen Layne had his BMR measured it was between 1,900 – 1,950 calories per day\nPeter notes when most people have their BMR measured it’s usually not done with indirect calorimetry (which is very rigorous) \n\nIt usually relies on on heart rate and respiratory rate\nThis can probably give some approximation, but it’s important to understand that there’s an enormous error that’s introduced when you make that approximation\n\n\nLayne agrees; direct calorimetry is the most rigorous way to measure one’s metabolic rate\n\nFor this you’re in a metabolic chamber and how much heat you’re generating is measured\nFrom the heat generated it’s possible to determine your total daily energy expenditure then determine your BMR using an equation based on your oxygen consumption versus your CO2 production (this is also done for indirect calorimetry)\nYou’re inside a hood, you’re breathing into a tube essentially\nYour metabolic rate is very closely associated with how much oxygen you consume\nHow much oxygen you consume versus how much CO2 you expire will give a good idea of your metabolic rate \n\nBecause the end products of metabolism are CO2 and water\nThis is also why one can use doubly labeled water to estimate energy expenditure (he’ll come back to this later)\nThere is a constant for water, knowing these constants and making assumptions can tell how much energy is being generated and you can come up with a relatively accurate estimate of your metabolic rate\n\n\nThe Weir formula is used, energy expenditure = (3.94)(VO2) + (1.11)(VCO2)\n\nThis is heavily weighted toward oxygen, about 4x oxygen used plus 1 times the carbon dioxide produced\nFor anyone who has ever had a VO2 max test, ask the lab to give you the raw data; they will usually provide the VO2 and VCO2 in 15-second intervals\nPlug the VO2 and VCO2 into the Weir formula to get how many calories per minute you’re consuming when your energy output is at your max\nA highly trained individual will easily get to 20 calories per minute of energy demand\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors influencing energy expenditure [16:38]\n“Lean mass is by far the biggest correlate to total daily energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate.” —Layne Norton\n\nLean mass requires quite a bit of oxygen compared to adipose tissue\nAlso when you start doing activity, it requires a lot of oxygen\nAll the energy you expend in 1 day is called the TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) \n\nThe biggest portion of this for most people is the BMR\nAn exception would be an elite athlete who trains for 6-8 hours a day; this would push the energy needed for physical activity higher than the BMR\n\n\nNext to consider is the TEF (thermic effective food or diet induced thermogenesis) \n\nFor most people this is anywhere from 5-10% of the total daily energy expenditure\nThis is very hard to measure\nUsually it’s expressed in terms of calories per minute because it’s only measured over the course of a couple hours\nThis is not a big contributor but should be considered \nThis is also macronutrient-dependent (he’ll come back to this later)\n\n\nThe last component is physical activity\n\nWhen people hear this, they think exercise; but this is all physical activity\nFor most people, the biggest component of their physical activity is something called NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis) \n\nThis is extremely modifiable\nPeople who are resistant to obesity tend to fidget a lot\nObese-prone individuals tend to have a very low NEAT\n\n\n\n\nA study done by Levine in 1999 where they overfed people by 1000 calories per day and looked at their total energy expenditure in a metabolic ward and how much weight people gained\n\nPublished in Science, Role of nonexercise activity thermogenesis in resistance to fat gain in humans\nSome people gained more weight than expected\n1 person did not have significant weight gain; they did gain weight but not enough to reach significance\n\n\nIt is important to distinguish between NEAT and exercise \n\nExercise is purposeful and not part of NEAT\n\n\nNEAT seems like nothing, a fidget, but thousands of those movements over the course of a day actually add up\n\nWhenever you try to do something that also requires your brain, you’re going to stop doing that because you actually can’t really do two things at once in terms of thinking about it\nNEAT truly is spontaneous energy expenditure\nIt appears to be modifiable by about 500 – 600 calories per day\n\nThis is seen in both overfeeding and underfeeding studies\nPeople who lose 10% of their body weight, they’ve seen up to a 500 calorie reduction in NEAT \n\nThis is a bip portion of it; then you consider purposeful exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen people want to invalidate energy balance he says, “Listen, you ate those carbons. Something must happen to them. They don’t flutter off into oblivion and you don’t create them out of nothing. Something has to happen to them”\nA lot of metabolic tracer studies show what happens to them\n\n \nThe challenge of tracking energy expenditure accurately, and the thermic effect of different macronutrients [23:30]\nSources of error when tracking calories [21:30] \n\nThe confusion arises when someone tracks their calories, sees a 500 calorie deficit but doesn’t lose weight\nThere are several sources of error\n\nPeople often weigh themselves sporadically\nIt’s virtually meaningless to weigh yourself only once a week\n\nLayne is very regimented about this: weigh yourself first thing in the morning after voiding your bladder and bowel (if possible) before eating\nTake that weight every single day and average it for the week\nCompare week to week averages\nWeight can easily fluctuate 2% per day; so if you’re 200 lbs you could be 204 or 196\nYou don’t want just 1 isolated data point\nA shift in fluids can make a difference but weekly and monthly changes in weight are dictated more by your actual body mass\n\n\n\n\n\nWrist devices that measure energy expenditures are not particularly accurate\n\nThe other thing that confuses people is tracking their energy expenditure\nA study of wrist devices found they overestimate exercise energy expenditure from 28-93%\n\n20 different devices were compared\nPublished in the Journal of Personalized Medicine in 2017, Accuracy in Wrist-Worn, Sensor-Based Measurements of Heart Rate and Energy Expenditure in a Diverse Cohort\n\n\nThis is a problem when you’re exercising and the device says you burned 500 calories when in reality you probably burned around 260-400 calories\nLayne often tells people, “What do you think is more likely? That you have found a way to violate the laws of thermodynamics or that this watch might not be accurate? Because I’m going to go with the latter.”\nIt is also difficult to accurately track calories because there is up to a 20% error allowed in food labels\nPeople also have trouble estimating their energy intake\nThere was a study in the 90s of people who self-reported as resistant to weight loss\n\nPublished in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1992, Discrepancy between Self-Reported and Actual Caloric Intake and Exercise in Obese Subjects\nThese people claimed they ate 1200 calories a day and didn’t lose weight\nThey put them in a metabolic ward and used doubly labeled water as well as direct calorimetry\n\n Doubly labeled water is a free living way of determining energy expenditure\n\n\nThey had the people track and report their food and found the average under reporting was 50%\n\nThis is in line with other studies, most overweight people under report by 30-70%\nLean people on average under report by 10-18%\n\n\nLayne doesn’t think people are lying but simply horrible at estimating their food intake\n\n\n\n“If I put a salad in front of you and I dump 50 grams of oil on it versus 20 grams of oil, you will have absolutely no idea of the difference”— Layne Norton\n\nLayne often tells people, “If you really believe that you are not able to eat calorie deficit and lose weight, I want you to, just for one week, track every single piece of food you put in your mouth”\n\nUsually when people come back their mind in blown\nThey thought they were eating 600 calories but counted 2,700 \nThey didn’t realize they grabbed a handful of nuts or chips or whatever it is\n\nIn isolation none of that stuff is a big dial but when you accumulate it throughout the day, it can be a big deal\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter’s experiment tracking energy expenditure with a metabolic chamber [27:30]\n\n8 years ago Peter had the luxury of being able to spend 6 days inside a metabolic chamber, in 2-day blocks\nHe loved it because he got to be in a room where nobody could bug him and he had it arranged so he could do all his exercising\n\nHe had his bike on a fluid trainer\nHe had a ton of weights, a plyometric box, and a bed\nHe had amazing food prepared by a metabolic kitchen who measured everything to the gram\n\n\nAfterwards he did a 10-day doubly labeled water (DLW) experience\n\nWater is H2O (2 hydrogens and 1 oxygen)\nThere is a heavy form of water called deuterium\nThere’s another form of water where oxygen doesn’t have 16 neutrons, instead it has 18 (oxygen-18)\nSo water can be labeled with a different isotope of hydrogen or different isotope of oxygen, heavy hydrogen or heavy oxygen\n\n\nFirst you drink D2O then you drink H2 heavy O\nWhen you collect your urine, you’re measuring the hydrogen that’s coming out without measuring the carbon that’s coming out\n\nThis allows you to calculate your VCO2\nYou collect urine serially and over the course of 10 or 12 days to get an estimate\n\n\nThe only instruction to Peter when doing this was try to keep his weight stable for that period of time, which he was able to do\n\nThis was a time in his life when he was tracking his ins and outs pretty well, mostly out of curiosity\n\n\nBy his calculations he was taking in 4,400 calories (this would imply an expenditure of 4,400 calories)\nThe DLW (doubly labeled water) showed an expenditure of 4,200 calories\n\nHe was amazed to be so close in his estimate\n\n\nPeter did this with Eric Ravussin at the Pennington Biomedical Research Institute\nHe wishes this analysis was available commercially\nEric and his staff were amazing; they allowed him to do this in a research lab\n\nDifficulties of tracking normal food intake\n\nLayne comments that since you are supposed to be weight stable, most people could do this\n\nBy default at the end of the day you’re weight stable within a reasonable amount\nAdd up whatever you’re eating to determine your total daily energy\n\n\nPeter notes this is hard unless people are going to carry a food scale everywhere with them\n\nThen the act of measuring everything creates a sort of Hawthorne effect\nPeople won’t take an extra bite of a candy bar or that handful of nuts because they don’t want to measure it\nOr people will want to eat normally and not measure anything and keep their weight constant \n\n\nLayne agrees, measuring changes behavior\nHe and his coaches at Team Biolayne encourage clients to track what they’re already doing, to enlighten them\n\nIf they lose weight while tracking he comments that they didn’t take that extra bite of snacks\n\n\nPeter notes with his patients when they do their intake, they realize nutrition is going to be an important thing to modify\n\nHe wants to see what people normally do, what their baseline is but it’s impossible when they start measuring\n\n\n\nThermic effect of different macronutrients \n“All calories are equal. Because again, calories are just a unit of measurement. All sources of calories are not equal in terms of their effects on energy expenditure and metabolizable energy.”— Layne Norton\n\nHe already discussed fiber and insoluble fiber\nConsider the TEF (thermic effect of food) of various foods\nThe TEF is the amount of energy your body has to put in to extract chemical energy out of food\nFat has the lowest TEF; it’s between 0-3 calories per 100 calories of fat\n\nSo you net about 97-100 calories from 100 calories of fat\n\n\nPeople will say, “Well celery is a negative calorie food because your body has to put more in” \n\nBut Layne points out, “Unless you’re talking about tree bark, there is no energy negative food. Even celery has like 50 calories. Or it might be five calories per hundred grams. So very, very low, but still not negative.”\nWe would not have lived long as a species if we had energy negative foods\n\n\nCarbohydrates have a TEF of 5-10%\n\nSo if you eat 100 calories of carbohydrate, you net 90-95 calories\n\n\nProtein has a TEF of 20-30%\n\nSo if you eat 100 calories of protein, you net 70-80 calories\n\n\nWhen people hear this they make a much bigger deal of it than it actually is\n\nConsider how much of a proportion of your overall energy expenditure this is\n\n\n\n \nChallenges of sustained weight loss: metabolic adaptation, set points, and more [34:45]\nMetabolic adaptation\n\nPeter notes one challenge of sustainable weight loss over a long period of time is how much is enough on a daily basis before an adaptation takes place that would correct it\n\n\nConsider a patient who is 50 pounds overweight\n\nIf this patient lost 50 pounds in a year\nIf they could create an energy debt of 75 calories per day by a macronutrient shift to more protein over a long enough period of time, could this be relevant\n\nLayne says it could but this neglects metabolic adaptation\n\n\n\n\nPeople think energy in, energy out\n\nThat these are static things that do not affect each other\nIn reality, they are intrinsically tied to each other \n\n\nIf you went on a 500 calorie deficit per day (a pretty significant deficit), do you lose linearly 1 lb per week until you no longer exist and you die because there’s no more body weight?\n\nNo, we all know that weight loss plateaus\nPart of this is because you have less body mass\n\nSo your body has to expend less energy to maintain upright posture, etc\n\n\nThere is also the NEAT component\n\nAs you lose weight, you become spontaneously less active\n\n\nFor people going from average-size to lean, their exercise will go down\n\nIf you look at their BMR, there is a reduction in BMR above what you would expect based on the loss of lean tissue and fat tissue\n\n\nYour body is fighting to get back to homeostasis\n\n\nJohn Speakman had a really good paper on this; this gets into set point theory\n\nPublished in the Annual Review of Nutrition in 2013,  Evolutionary perspectives on the obesity epidemic: adaptive, maladaptive, and neutral viewpoints \nThis is the idea that the body has this native set point of weight that it likes to be at\nNow, what is regulating the ends of that set point?\n\nIf we get too lean and lose too much fat mass, we die\nAt the higher ends, there are things that work against obesity\nWhen you overfeed NEAT goes up, so does BMR\nObviously society is shifting towards adiposity so the regulations for going up are not as strong as for going down\n\n\n\n\nThink about it from an evolutionary perspective, obesity is not going to kill you in the short term\n\nResearch suggests it will be the difference in dying at 70 versus 80\nThe risk in the short term is predation of a physical altercation where you can’t defend yourself very well, or you can’t run away\nThe risk of predation after man learned how to use tools pretty much went to zero\n\n\n\n\nThe risks of starvation are very real, even now in some parts of the world\n\n“It makes sense that the regulatory mechanisms were more powerful on that bottom end to prevent people from becoming too lean, than they are on the top end”— Layne Norton\n\nYou have to think of energy balance, like a car that changes its gas efficiency based on how full the tank is\n\nSo think about if you had a car that when you have the gas tank filled all the way up, it gets horrible gas mileage\nBut as that gas tank starts to go down (think about your gas tank as your body’s adipose stores, your energy stores), you become more and more and more efficient\nSo by the time there’s very little gas left, it’s just sipping gas\n\n\nThe biggest thing to take away is, we cannot know\n\nWe can know at a snapshot in time what your energy expenditure probably is\nBut it’s likely to change \nAnd it’s a sliding scale, and it depends on a lot of variables\n\n\n\n \nWeight loss strategies: tracking calories, cheat meals, snacks, fasting, exercise, and more [40:45]\nTracking calories is like keeping a budget\n\nEnergy expenditure depends on a lot of variables and is likely to change\nThis has led people to think that we can’t accurately track calories in or out so there’s no point in tracking calories\n\nThis is like throwing the baby out with the bath water\nYou don’t have to track calories to lose weight\n\n\nBut this is like saying, “Keeping a budget is worthless, because I have multiple streams of revenue and I have investments. And so I can’t exactly how much income I’m getting. And also things pop up, like your car breaks down, you have repairs to your house. So you can’t exactly know what your expenses are going to be. So therefore keeping a budget is worthless.”\n\nYou don’t have to keep a budget to same money, but it’s a useful tool\nA budget gets you in the ballpark and to a baseline; the same is true of tracking calories\nThe act of keeping a budget prompts you to think twice before making a frivolous purchase\nThe average person under reports their debt by 155%\n\nThere are a lot of parallels between this and tracking calories\n\n\n\n\nLayne asks if Peter was maintaining his weight on 4,400 calories a day\n\nPeter notes he was training a lot more than he does now\nHe was probably exercising 3 hours a day\nLayne note this is a very large budget\n\n\nIf you have a large budget you can pay your mortgage, utilities, and all of your responsibilities and still have some leftover to buy that sports car\n\nBut if you make $50,000 a year and want to buy a $70,000 sports car; that’s a bad idea unless you have a ton of money stored in the bank\nSimilarly when people see the flexible dieting Layne uses they think we’re just eating junk food all the time  \n\n\nPeople seem shocked that some can eat junk food and lose weight\nLayne responds “Everything is on a continuum here. There’s a big difference between somebody having like a small bowl of ice cream that they fit into their budget for the day, that allows them to feel less restricted and feel like they’re not missing out. That prevents them from having a huge binge session down the road when their willpower eventually breaks.”\n\nThis doesn’t work for everyone\nBut some people can have a little ice cream if they’re getting enough dietary fiber, hitting their protein, and not going over calories\n\n\n\nA question Peter is commonly asked\n“Do you think it is better to be completely restrictive or to have frequent cheat meals, like one meal a week or one day a week where you go completely off the rails or just to have a little bit of stuff that is an indulgence every single day?” \n\nPeter doesn’t have a great answer, even for an individual this might change\nConsider Peter’s experience, he was on a ketogenic diet for 3 years (with the exception of 1 day) \n\nThe only time he deviated was at his wife’s birthday, when he had 7 pieces of cake\nThis was from 2011-2014\nHe could never do this again; it would be hard for him to go on a ketogenic diet for more than 2 weeks now\nHe can definitely get away with a daily indulgence or weekly indulgence because it’s very easy for him to get back on track\n\n\n\n“I basically follow a very simple rule, which is never do two bad things back to back”— Peter Attia\n\nIf you ever miss a workout, the single most important thing is making sure on the next day that you work out\n\nSimilarly, if you ever have a complete blowout meal, the single most important meal is the next one\n\n\nRealize too that many people do very well in a highly, highly restricted environment\n\nAnd when they deviate from that restricted environment, it sets them off on a path that doesn’t make sense\n\n\n\nHow does someone predict which path is going to work for them?\n\nPart of it depends on this person’s personality and their individual psychology\nIf you want to lose weight, you are going to have to use some form of restriction: calorie counting, points, carb restriction, fat restriction, unprocessed food, fasting, time restriction, etc.\n\nCounting calories works because it restricts calories\n\n\n\nYou should pick the form of restriction that feels least restrictive to you as an individual\n\nThis is where people get really crossed up \nPeople will find a form of restriction that feels un-restrictive and then they think this approach is right for everyone\nHe often hears, “I tried intermittent fasting. It felt like I wasn’t even dieting. I lost 50 pounds and it wasn’t even hard.”\nThis is why you’ll hear people make crazy claims about low carb or any diet, which are all excellent tools\n\n“I just am not a fan of insane claims about those particular diets”— Layne Norton\n\nPeople think he doesn’t like ketogenic diets or intermittent fasting but that’s not true\nPart of the problem is people try restricting calories and it doesn’t work\n\nThen they go on a ketogenic diet and think they are eating more and losing weight\n\nMaybe they felt like they were eating more, but unless you’re weighting everything out\nKetogenic diets have really limited food choices; there are not many options for snacking\n\n\n\n\n\nSnacks\n“A very vigorously present characteristic of people who lose weight and keep it off, is they don’t really snack. They have defined meals”— Layne Norton\n\nSnacks do not appear to be as satiating, not just because of the food, but because of the mindset\n\nWhen you snack, you tend to do it and not being mindful about it so it doesn’t have the same satiety effect\n\n\nLayne tells clients to stop snacking\n\nIf they like snacks and they can fit them into their calories, it’s fine\n\n\nWhen people stop snacking they realize they don’t feel hungry\n\nNow they are losing weight because they cut out 300-400 calories\n\n\nPeter agrees at least empirically, that when people eliminate eating between meals they have improvement of: body weight, body composition, and biomarkers\n\nPeople aren’t snacking on the most healthy foods to begin with\n\n\n\nLessons learned from fasting\n\nThis is where he has found fasting to be a valuable tool\n\nIf you put somebody through a 3 day, 5 day (or even longer) water-only fast, they learn a very important lesson\n\nI’m not going to die if I’m acutely hungry\n\n\nEven if you do it only once, it teaches you a couple things\n\n1) That you can do it\n2) Hunger comes in waves\nIn that 5 day period of eating nothing, there will be periods of time when you literally want to eat your arm\nAnd you will have periods during that 5 days when you have forgotten that you’re fasting\n\n\nAfter going through 5 days of difficult fasting you can accept a regimen of not eating any snacks \n\nEating nothing from noon – 6, even when you feel really hungry at 3\nYou’ll realize you are going to eat in 3 hours and you can make it to 6\n\n\nYou don’t have to be a fasting guru or do a quarterly fast to experience this\n\n\n\n“People confuse hunger and appetite a lot”— Layne Norton\n\nPeople think they don’t get hungry on certain diets (ketogenic, plant-based, etc.)\n\nThis can be true\nBut there are a lot more reasons why people eat than hunger\n\nSocietal cues, stress, boredom, lots of things\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n“One of the reasons exercise works so well, is one, it sensitizes you to satiety signals”— Layne Norton\n\nExercise has a powerful effect on weight loss for several reasons\n\n1) Becoming more sensitive to your satiety hormones\n2) Spending an hour doing something physical is an hour your not bored and eating\n\n\n\n \nSitting in discomfort, focusing on habits, and other lessons Layne learned as a natural bodybuilder [52:15]\n\nLayne tells his clients, “Listen, if you want to lose weight, you’re going to be hungry at some point, physically hungry. You will be.”\n\nAs someone who has been stage-lean as a bodybuilder with absolutely minimal amounts of body fat, he knows about this hunger\nThe level of discomfort is all consuming, you cannot think about anything else other than when you’re going to eat next\nWhen you finish your meal, you’re hungry 5 minutes later and already thinking about your next meal\nThe level of fatigue is so high; it’s a monumental effort\n\n\n\nGetting lean for competition, reducing body fat\n\nWhen Layne was competing as a bodybuilder he calipered at 2% body fat\nDEXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) is the gold standard for measuring body fat\n\nBut unless your a cadaver and someone is excising your adipose tissue, you’ll never really know what your % fat is because all these measurements make assumptions\nThinking of his DEXA measurement, he probably had 5-6% fat\n\nThis is what a lot of stage-lean bodybuilder have\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring with calipers, he can get to about 7% fat\n\nComing down from 14-15%\n\n\nIf he’s 230 lbs he will be 14-15% fat; more like 15% on calipers\n\nTo get down to 7% is no problem; it hardly phases him because he’s done it so many times\nTo get from 7% to 2-3% is exponentially more difficult\nThis will probably take 12-16 weeks\nIt’s not just losing the weight but also maintaining the lean mass\n\n\n\n“Maintaining the lean mass as a drug free athlete is extremely difficult”— Layne Norton\n\nWithout drugs, getting down to 2% fat and maintaining lean mass is going to take more than 12 weeks\n\nUnless you’re already extremely lean\n\n\nThe best natural bodybuilder he ever coached, his name was Brian Whitacre (see the picture below)\n\nHe won the WNBF Lightweight World Title 6 times \nHe is the only man to win the WNBF Overall World Title and the IFPA Overall World Title\n\nThese are the two biggest federations\nHe’s the only man to ever unify them\n\n\nAnd this guy, at 12 weeks out, would look ready, and then he would lose 10 more lbs\n\nProbably 6-7 lbs of that would be fat\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17886\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f3-laynenorton2-684x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f3-laynenorton2-684x1024.png 684w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f3-laynenorton2-201x300.png 201w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f3-laynenorton2-768x1149.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f3-laynenorton2.png 1004w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" />\nFigure 3. Brian Whitacre, professional natural bodybuilder.  Image credit: brianwitacre.net/gallery\nThe problem is the loss of fat and lean mass [54:45]\n\nAn overweight/ obese person can lose almost 100% fat tissue\nBut adipose is actually about 13% lean tissue\n\nSo it’s very normal to see about a 13% to 20% loss of lean tissue when dieting\nWater and adipose also has protein in it, and part of that is lost during the remodeling of the tissue\n\n\nIt’s important to make the distinction of what happens in a drug-free bodybuilder because steroids change the physiology and tilts thing toward retention of lean mass (if not building lean mass)\n As you get leaner and leaner, you are going to have a progressive shift to losing more lean body mass for a few reasons\n\n1) Your body is sending out hormones to try and conserve fat tissue\n\nFrom this perspective, if you are 200 pounds and 190 of that is lean body mass (5% body fat), that last little bit of fat is the biggest energy reservoir\nThe body is in emergency mode and will start to tear the house down to keep this fat instead of a massive amount of lean tissue\nThis is very interesting\n\n\n\n\n\n“The best way to look as muscular as possible, is to be as lean as humanly possible”— Layne Norton\n\nLook at the picture of Brian Witacre (above)\n\nHe’s one of the greatest natural bodybuilders of all time\nA lovely person and a very smart guy\nHe’s a professor of economics at Oklahoma State\nIt’s incredible, he’s so lean that he has veins in his glutes and striations that look like fingers\n\nPeter remembers the first bodybuilder he ever saw this in; he was maybe 13 years old\nHe was amazed to see Samir Bannout, who was the 1983 Mr. Olympia\nTo think that one could achieve striations in his lower back and in his glutes without steroids and diuretics is pretty amazing\n\n\nBrian was about 160 to 165 pounds on stage; and he’s 5’9”\n\nIf you saw him in his shirt you would think, “Oh, he’s nothing. He looks athletic.”\nIf you saw him with his clothes off, you would think he weighs at least 200 lbs\n\n\nBrian is also very strong\n\nHe and Layne did a 3x bodyweight deadlift challenge at Oklahoma State University\n\n\n\n\n\n==> Check out this video: 3X Bodyweight Deadlift Rep Challenge: Dr. Layne Norton vs. Dr. Brian Whitacre\n \n\nIn Brian’s off season he weighs 180/185; this still looks very lean\n\n“I think bodybuilders can really teach important lessons about physiology in terms of energy metabolism”— Layne Norton\n\nPeter agrees, bodybuilding is an underappreciated discipline\n\nIt’s very easy to dismiss bodybuilders as drug using\nBut when it’s natural, Peter is “blown away at how dialed in they are on their nutrition. Insane.”\n\n\n\nStrategies to accept feeling uncomfortable and push toward your goal\n\nOne of the things Layne tells his clients and has heard so many times from different competitors is, “You have to learn to sit with your discomfort”\n\nThis can apply to many things, even in business\nHe’s sitting with his discomfort right now because he’s expanded his business and his expenses are way higher\n\nHe’s making good revenue but the 20-year old voice of Layne in his head says, “It would just take one bad month, and these expenses will crush us.”\n\n\n\n\n\n“So it’s talking yourself through, and sitting with that discomfort”— Layne Norton\n\nWhen it comes to food, ask yourself, “Okay. Am I actually hungry? Or am I just queued up to eat right now?”\n\nIf it is actual hunger, ask yourself:\n\nWhat are your goals?\nIf you eat now, is it going to make it more difficult later?\n\n\nThere is not right or wrong answer\nBut most people can handle a lot more discomfort than they think they can\n\n\nJust because you’re uncomfortable doesn’t mean you have to do anything about it\n\nYou can sit with that; a lot of people haven’t done this\n\n\nThat internal conversation is important\nThis is why obesity is so difficult\n\nPeople want to make it about the Xs and Os\nIt’s not about eat this protein, carbs, fats, or any of that\nIt’s that stress and trauma and hardwired habits and behaviors are so difficult to change\n\n\n\n“It really is more about changing people’s habits and behaviors than it is about the Xs and Os”— Layne Norton\n\nThis is true in sports too, what matters for a head coach is leadership\n\nCommunicate and get everybody on the same page\nThis person came in and they changed the culture of this team\nThat’s not Xs and Os; that’s habits and behaviors\n\n\n\n \nCommonalities in people who maintain long-term weight-loss [1:01:15]\n\nMarie Spreckley published a great systematic review on sustained weight loss\n\nPublished in the International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being in 2021, Perspectives into the experience of successful, substantial long-term weight-loss maintenance: a systematic review\nShe actually messaged Layne and told him that reading his book is what inspired her to do her PhD\n\n\n\n\nWhat did they have in common? \nWhat was difficult? \nWhat did they find motivating?\nThe things that came up weren’t dietary \n\n1) It was their environment\n2) It was their habits, their behavior\n3) One of the big things that came up was support, either good or bad\n\nSupport to have someone to say, “I believe in you.  I know you can do thisHow can I help you?” made a big difference\nThis was better than the criticism, micromanaging type of support\n\n\n4) Stress was a big factor, trauma, and binge eating \n\n\nThe binge eating component is underappreciated\n\nA lot of people struggle with this\nMany people will do great Monday-Friday\n\nBut they get to the weekend and eat pancakes in the morning and drink all day\nAlcohol is really calorie-dense and it encourages you to make poor food choices\nA lot of people eat 1500 calories through the week then easily eat 4000 calories on the weekends\n\n\n\n\nMuch of sustainable weight loss is reprogramming habits and behaviors instead of a particular diet\n\nNo one diet came up up as being superior\nWhat came up repeatedly was these series of habits and behaviors that helped people lose weight and sustain that weight loss\n\n\n\n \nDoes a ketogenic diet result in greater energy expenditure? [1:03:15]\n\nPeter goes back to the energy balance question; we know a lot more now than we did 10 years ago\nBefore there was still an open question about the impact of different macronutrients on energy expenditure, both deliberate and non deliberate\nPeter used to be part of an organization that funded 2 really big studies in this space\n\n1 out of Boston Children’s Hospital by David Ludwig\nA 2nd one was by a consortium of people that included Rudy Leibel, Kevin Hall (was the PI), Eric Robinson, Steve Smith, etc.\n\nLayne notes, “That’s the heavy hitters name of metabolism”\n\n\n\n\nThis second study was very rigorously done\n\nIt was a pilot study; it wasn’t perfect\nIt was designed to work out the kinks in preparation for an enormous study that never got funded\nIt was still a very good study, and it compared a relatively clean standard American diet to a ketogenic diet\nIt’d be hard to make the case that there was more than 50 to 150 calorie difference in energy expenditure at an isocaloric swap\n\nSome would say this could be significant over a long enough period of time\nThere has been a significant debate about the validity of doubly labeled water in a ketogenic diet\nJohn Speakman and Kevin Hall wrote a review about this suggesting that doubly labeled water really doesn’t apply, that there’s an artifact in a ketogenic diet\nSo it’s unclear if this calorie difference really matters\nPublished in the International Journal of Obesity in 2019 Do low-carbohydrate diets increase energy expenditure? \nRegardless, this difference wasn’t 250-500 kcal per day and this was a very important insight\n\nThe overfeeding study by Ethan Sims in Vermont in the 1960s and work of Ancel Keys didn’t have metabolic chambers\n\n\n\n\nPeter’s view of the evidence is that a ketogenic diet results in weight loss through reduction of calories eaten not an increase in energy expenditure\n\nLayne agrees\n\n\n\n\n\nDifficulties measuring energy expenditure in people eating a ketogenic diet\n\nLayne notes it’s important that direct calorimetry measurements are accurate\n\nHe’s going to ignore energy expenditure for  ow\nPeter adds that the 57 kcal per day was probably right at the limit of detection so it could’ve been 0-100 kcal\n\n\nThe carbohydrate insulin model of obesity would predict a much bigger change in energy expenditure\n\nSo therefore, at least that version of it has to be falsified based on that\nAnd even with the 150 calories, that would not explain the difference.\n\n\nIf we look at studies that assess loss of body fat under controlled environments, we just don’t see differences between low carb and low fat when calories and protein are controlled\n\nThere’s actually very small favoritism towards low fat\nBut that’s probably a data artifact and not a real difference\n\n\nDavid Ludwig published a recent meta-analysis that made the assertion that there doesn’t appear to be much difference in the short-term data in low carb diets\n\nBut longer-term (after 17 days), there appears to be a large difference in energy expenditure on the order of 150-300 calories per day\nPublished in the Journal of  Nutrition in 2021, Do Lower-Carbohydrate Diets Increase Total Energy Expenditure? An Updated and Reanalyzed Meta-Analysis of 29 Controlled-Feeding Studies\nThis meta-analysis was very well done; the statistics are very good\nBut when there was metabolic chamber data available or doubly  labeled water, they used doubly labeled water\nTo Layne this is like saying “I’ve got caliper data available, and DEXA data available, but I’m going to use the caliper data”\n\nKeep in mind that DEXA is what calipers are validated against, so you’re talking about a primary measure versus a secondary measure\n\n\n\n\nPeter remembers that he got Kevin Hall and John Speakman’s primary criticism of DLW (doubly labeled water) in a KD (ketogenic diet)\n\nThe gist of their thesis on where the artifact comes from is there’s more CO2 produced than is accounted for in the constant of the equation\n\nThe 1.11 is probably too low a number [Weir formula = (3.94)(VO2) + (1.11)(VCO2)]\n\n\n\n\nLayne reasons that overproduce CO2 compared to what the prediction would be based on that equation\n\nBasically what that means is that in a low carb setting, you’re probably getting an artificial increase in energy expenditure\nSo Peter realizes that 1.11 would actually be too large a coefficient\n\n\nLayne considers if this isn’t an artifact of differences in measures, and with direct calorimetry on a standard diet, the association with doubly labeled water is an R of 0.8\n\nThis is good for free living\nPeter agrees that 0.8 is good but not exceptional\n\n\nBut then low carb is 0.8 which is a big difference from 0.8\n\n It basically just means it’s not as tightly correlated\n\n\n\nRefocus on losing body fat\n\nLayne went through every single study that Ludwig looked at\n\nHe looked to see if they measured body composition and what this data said\nBecause what do we care about?\n\nDo we care about what energy expenditure says on a read out? \nOr do we care about losing body fat?\n\n\n\n\n\n“Not one study saw a difference between the low carb conditions, or the low fat, or balanced diet when calories and protein were equated”— Layne Norton\n\nThis is great news for Layne because it says, do whatever diet you prefer and still lose body fat\n\nLow carb, low fat, a balanced diet, etc.\n\n\nA balanced diet can be harder for some people to moderate unless you’re doing some kind of portion control\n\nLayne’s perspective on interpreting studies\n\nThis simply shows the effect of changing the inputs for a study\nPeople ask him, “How can I get better at reading this stuff?”\n\nGo to grad school\nLayne can’t tell you how many times in about studies with his PI (Don Lehman) that his hypothesis were crushed \n\nDon would ask “What if you consider this?”’\nThis was very enlightening for Layne\n\n\nThe best part of grad school was sitting around a table with graduate students and Don, and just rapping back and forth with studies\n\nThis gave him a good idea for how to look critically at this stuff\n\n\n\n\n\n“I don’t get excited about 1 study. Wake me up when there’s 10.”— Layne Norton\n\nEven with 10 studies, he’s going to look at how it was done with a critical eye\nHe hears people say, “I don’t trust science because this study says this thing, and this study says that thing”\n\nHe points people to the methods and results\nYou need to understand what you’re looking at, understand statistics, understand research design\n\n\n\n“Don’t read the conclusions of the authors. Look at the actual results. Look at the methods. And you can usually understand why they seemingly found different results.”— Layne Norton\n\nPeter agrees, he has a series on the blog called studying studies where he goes through all this methodology\n\nIt’s not a substitute for getting reps on the field\nIt’s like reading everything about playing a sport, but you actually have to play\nHe’s toyed with the idea of putting together a journal club\n\nThis is what Layne is describing and how you learn to read studies\nDoing this every week allows you to get good at reading the fine print\n\n\n\n\nThe media has a need to put out the most punchy headline\n\nA great example was an article on something to the effect of smelling your partner’s farts might help prevent cancer\n\nThe research actually showed that 1 volatile fatty acid produced by the gut microbiome in response to fibe may have a protective effect on breast cancer when given to animals in a high dose\nThat’s a long way from you taking a sniff of your partner’s fart and preventing cancer\nBut this is what confuses people\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe metabolic benefits of exercise, muscle mass, and protein intake [1:15:00]\n\nNo one ever says, I wish I had less muscle\n\n“If you want to be metabolically healthy, the best thing you can do is have lots of lean body mass”— Layne Norton\n\nMuscle/ lean body mass is a metabolic sink\nObese powerlifters may have some elevations in blood lipids and whatnot, but usually their insulin sensitivity and blood glucose are okay\n\nBenefits of exercise\n\nExercise is one of the only things that we know of that without even weight loss improves metabolic health substantially, really substantially\nLayne was on the Rogan podcast a few years ago and made the point that people get caught up in carbs and fat but they’re not even exercising\n\nThis is like stepping over dollars to pick up fractions of pennies\n#1176- Dom D’Agostino & Layne Norton (September 2018)\nA high dose of exercise is not required\nJust going and being sedentary to walking 100 minutes a week, and you will see improvements in health markers \n\n\nLayne had his blood work done a while back; he has familial hypercholesterolemia so his LDL tends to run a little high\nPeople were speculating that he would have really high inflammation because he eats 70-80 grams of sugar a day\n\nBut he’s also getting 60-70 grams of fiber along with that\nHis CRP (C-reactive protein) was hardly detectable\nThis speaks to the fact that there is a big difference between somebody who is an athlete, training hard, who has a lot of muscle mass, versus somebody who’s sedentary with excess adiposity\n\nIt’s just not even comparable when you talk about food choices and whatnot\n\n\n\n\n\n“You have a lot more you can get away with, with a lot of muscle mass”— Layne Norton\n\nOlder and frail people don’t think about this [muscle mass]\n\nPeople say, “You do all that heavy lifting, you’re going to be in pain when you’re older”\nBut you’re going to be in pain when you’re older regardless\n\nDo you want to be in pain and strong or in pain and weak?\nPeter agrees, when he asks people who have experienced activity and inactivity they will recall being in more discomfort when inactive\n\n\n\n\n\n“Sitting is to lower back pain what bourbon is to alcoholism”— Peter Attia\n\nThe worst thing you can do is be immobile\n\n \nThe impact of lean muscle and strength on lifespan and healthspan [1:20:00]\nHypothetical case study #1— a 50-year old, mother of 3 whose never lifted weights\n\nA 50-year old, mother of 3, going through menopause, putting on a little bit of weight\nShe’s never lifted weights but thinks she needs to do more cardio, be more active\nHer DEXA shows she is 30% body fat, but it’s a skinny fat\nHer ALMI (appendicular lean mass index) is 6; this puts her at the 10th percentile of muscle mass\nWhat would Layne prescribe? \nLayne notes, “Muscle is a lot like bone in that you want to lay down as much as possible because eventually, it’s going to start receding. But it is still possible to add muscle.”\n\nIt’s never too late to add muscle\n\nThe lab across the street from  Layne at the University of Illinois did a study on 80-year old frail individuals\n\nThey started with a squat to a high chair and come up\n\nSquat down into a parallel chair\nGradually, they put the chair down and squat with weight\n\n\nThis was a 16-week study\nIn talking to graduate students working on this study, they were amazed because by the end of it,these people increased their lean body mass (as a percentage of their body weight) pretty much the same amount that a 20 year old does\n\nThe relative increase was similar\n\n\nTheir weight was lower to start with so they had less overall mass\nBut by the end, some of them were able to add weight\nIt’s never too late to get active\n\n\nGoing back to the finance metaphor, it’s never too late to start saving\n\nIf you can be one of those fortunate people who starts saving right away, there is zero downsides to this\n\n\nIn his practice Peter see’s 50-year old women going through menopause and the composition of their bodies is really changing to more fat and less muscle mass\n\nHe looks at what they are eating, 50-60 g protein a day on a good day\nAssessing their strength show they are incredibly weak\n\n\n\nThe importance of muscle in older people\n\nHe talks to these patients about the cause of death by decade\n\nThe level of accidental deaths, is very interesting because it is the same across age groups\n\nUnlike cardiovascular disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease which are all very age dependent\nWhat differs dramatically is the type of accident\n\nYoung people die in automobile accidents\nThe oldest people die in accidental falls\n\n\n\n\nPeter notes, “I’ve never seen a person who doesn’t just stop in their tracks because they cannot believe how much morbidity and mortality results from falling and frailty once you reach about the age of 70, 75.”\n\n\nLayne agrees, there was a review by Bob Wolfe that essentially showed that after age 65, you could tie the majority of deaths to some kind of lack of muscular strength or lack of muscle\n\nPublished in the Journal of Nutrition, Health, & Aging in 2008, The danger of weight loss in the elderly\n\n\nMeta analyses of mortality show that lean body mass is inversely proportional to your risk of mortality after age 50\nPeter adds that the hazard ratio for being strong to not strong is about 3.2 for all cause mortality\n\nThat’s a staggering hazard ratio\nIt’s higher than smoking; smoking is about 2\nEnd stage renal disease is about 3\nThe only thing higher that Peter has discussed is VO2 max, comparing the top 2.5% to the bottom 25%\n\nThis hazard ratio is 5.1\n\n\n\n\n\n“These are not mutually exclusive. So why not have remarkable cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle mass, and strength?”— Peter Attia\n\nLayne notes one of the barriers is that people don’t want to get to bulky or too muscular\n\nAs someone who’s spent their entire adult life trying to get too muscular, and basically just looks really fit in a T-shirt, he doesn’t worry about this\nIf you do start to get too muscular, you can always just back off\n\n\nPeter brings this back to the financial comparison; he’s worried about getting too rich\nLayne notes the benefit gained from spending 30-40 minutes resistance training, 3x a week is unbelievable in terms of your level of fitness and ability to live a long, healthy life\n\nIt doesn’t have to be crazy intense training, just an amount that forces your body to adapt\n\n\n\n“The amount of benefit you will get from three times a week, 30 to 40 minutes of resistance training. . .will be unbelievable in terms of your level of fitness and your ability to live a long, healthy life.” —Layne Norton\n \nHypothetical case study #1: Training program for 50-year-old female [1:27:45]\n\nA 50 year old female, mother of 3\n\nShe’s not completely unfit\nShe does yoga and walks but has never lifted weights\nShe’s going through menopause and putting on a little weight\n\n\n\nWhat should she do for her 1st 4-month program?\n\nFirst consider what is reasonable for her lifestyle, what can she do?\nLet’s say she will commit to 40 minutes, 3x a week in the weight room\nLower body strength is a little bit more important than upper body strength in terms of preventing falls\n\nHe always think about falls from a bone density perspective\nHe doesn’t want people to fall and break their hip because that specific fall is pretty much a death sentence if you’re over the age of 65\nBone density is increased by lifting weights much more than anything you’d ever get through your diet\n\n\nSpend 2 days doing lower body and 1 day doing upper body\n\nYou could even flip flop this on alternating weeks if you wanted\n\n\nFocus on machine stuff that’s easy to do\n\nSince she has never trained before, everything’s going to cause an adaptation, and that’s the goal\nHe’s not going to have her come in and try and free squat, or deadlift; that’s a really horrible idea\nStart with a leg extension, a leg curl, a leg press\n\n\nPeter asks, “Would you have her do anything that’s a little more compounded and complicated, for example, holding dumbbells and stepping up onto a bench where now she has to manage grip strength with a bit of balance, and also getting the leg load?”\n\nNot in the initial weeks, just because the soreness is going to be so high it’s going to impede a lot of that movement \n\n\n\nSoreness\n\nPeople tend to think about soreness in the wrong way; it’s correlated with muscle growth and strength\n\nBut it’s not causative\nIf you’re sore all the time, you’re probably training incorrectly\nIf you’re never sore, you’re also probably training incorrectly\nIf you’re doing an appropriate amount of volume and intensity, there probably should be some soreness from time to time, but if you’re getting sore all the time, then your programming is pretty bad\n\n\nWhat he’s trying to do in the initial stages is work just enough to adapt and not cause enormous amounts of soreness\n\nSoreness can be discouraging and impede subsequent sessions\n\n\n\nExpectations for the first 4-6 weeks\n\nLayne wants to get her through 4-6 weeks\nThe data on muscle protein turnover doesn’t show increases in hypertrophy during the 1st 6 weeks of resistance training\n\nDiscussed in his first appearance on the podcast, #163 – Layne Norton, Ph.D.: Building muscle, losing fat, and the importance of resistance training\nDuring this time the tissue is remodeled to become stronger, more resilient, and it starts protecting itself against damage\nThis is where muscle protein synthesis goes up, but muscle protein degradation also goes up\n\nIt’s a cycle where the muscle tissue is simply turned over\n\n\n\n\nAfter about 6 weeks, muscle protein degradation tends to go down while muscle protein synthesis stays up\n\nThis is where you start seeing those increases in hypertrophy and lean mass\n\n\n\n \nMuscle protein synthesis in a trained athlete vs. untrained individual following a resistance training program [1:31:30]\n\nPeter asks how this female’s progress compares to a trained athlete\nThere’s a paper from Damas that looks at myofibrillar protein synthesis in response to resistance exercise\n\nPublished in Sports Medicine in 2015, A review of resistance training-induced changes in skeletal muscle protein synthesis and their contribution to hypertrophy\nThey see that the amplitude of muscle protein synthesis in trained people is a little bit lower than untrained so you don’t have quite the same response\nIt depends on when you measure\nIf you measure at 16 hours post, they’re about the same; there’s about a 40% increase\nIf you measure at 4 hours post, the increase in the trained athlete is still about 40%, but for the untrained, it is about 70%\n\nThere’s a little bit of difference in amplitude\n\n\nBut what really is the difference is the duration\n\nIn trained people, it’s back down to baseline about 10 to 20 hours after the initial bout of resistance training \nIn untrained people, they still have elevated rates of protein synthesis 2-3 days later\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks if this protein synthesis could be offset by degradation\n\nIt could; unfortunately degradation is much more difficult to measure\nUnfortunately you can’t really measure all 3 things at 1 time\nYou can measure the net balance with an AV balance (arterio-venous balance)\n\nInfuse a labeled amino acid then sample the arterial of a muscle bed and then the venous of the muscle bed\nDepending on how much of that label shows up in the vein versus the artery, we know how much is being retained in muscle and we know what the net is\n\n\nYou can infuse a second label to presumably get synthesis as well and then you can figure out the difference of degradation\n\nBut the problem with this is it requires a steady state\nYou can’t do it when you’ve trained or had a meal or anything like that so it has to be done while fasting\n\n\nThe problem with degradation is how you’re measuring it\n\nFor example, out of every amino acid that’s used for protein synthesis, 7-8 of them are recycled from protein degradation\nPeter recalls learning about this in his earlier podcast with Layne and often wonders after finishing a workout how many amino acids in protein shake versus amino acids eviscerated from deadlifting are going to be the ones used for net myofibrillar synthesis\n\nLayne doesn’t think about it this way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“If you want to maximize muscle mass, you want to maximize protein synthesis (obviously) and maximize deposition”—Layne Norton\n\nThe first theory was that you can only really deposit about 5-10 g of amino acids per day in muscle\n\nIf it’s 10 grams a day then this is 8.5 lbs a year\nBut muscle tissue is about 70% water so to get to the actual protein content divide 8 lbs by 0.3; so it’s 26 lbs\n\nThat’s a lot of lean body mass even for a novice trainer\nWe know the max is about 5-10 g in a drug-free person\nHe’s not sure how much this would increase with anabolic steroid use\nIt’s hard to get IRB approval to do research with steroids\nMagazines exaggerate a lot of stuff, even 30 lbs of skeletal muscle wet tissue would be a ton for someone on drugs (look in the grocery store at 30 lb of beef)\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent patient of Peter’s who began an exercise program\n\nPeter just had a female patient who went from being not very active to getting very active\nShe had a DEXA scan separated by 5 months (simply through circumstances of having the scan at different facilities)\n\nThis suggested she gained 6 lbs of lean tissue\nOne of these scans must have been wrong\nShe probably did gain some lean tissue \nLayne says if you do a DEXA scan then drink a gallon of water and scan again, you’ll have gained 8 lbs of lean tissue\nThis result could simply be due to a hydration artifact but she probably gained some lean muscle\n\n\n\n \nProtein and amino acids needed to build and maintain muscle mass [1:37:15]\nRDA (recommended daily allowance) for protein\n\nYou need just 50 g of protein to meet the requirements in terms of having a positive nitrogen balance\nYou can’t just add 10 g of protein and assume that every amino acid goes straight to lean tissue\n\nProtein is also oxidized\n\n\nIn order to maximize your deposition to get that 5-10 grams, you need to maximize protein synthesis\nBut to maximize protein synthesis requires a disproportionate amount of total protein\n\nLayne thinks it’s around 1.6 to 2.4 grams per kilogram of body weight\nThis kind of winds up with that old 1 gram per pound of body weight number\nYou need a disproportionate amount of protein to maximize the deposition\n\n\nOne of the ways that protein needs are assessed is what’s called the indicator amino acid method; this is the gold standard\nYou could also look at direct amino acid oxidation\n\nIf you eat increasing levels of protein and look at the oxidation levels of a specific amino acid, it’ll be flat and then you’ll hit an inflection point where it’ll go up linearly\nThat inflection point is where amino acid oxidation increases, and eating protein beyond this point doesn’t increase muscle synthesis\nThis is an association not causation\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective it would make sense that at the point where you use protein for energy (oxidize it) you could also start building extra tissue\nThis is the point where there is a surplus of protein\nThis is around 1 g protein intake per kg of body weight (even at this low level)\n\n\n\n\nLayne notes that you’ve got to eat a lot more protein to get out what you want; it’s an inefficient system \n\nSome amino acids can be directly oxidized after they are deaminated [the first step of protein catabolism removes the amino group]\nSome amino acids can enter the Krebs cycle\n\nThe figure below shows amino acids that are only glucogenic (can be used in gluconeogenesis) in red\nThose that are only ketogenic (can be converted to Acetyl-CoA) in green\nMost amino acids can be directed into either glucogenic or ketogenic pathways; these are shown in purple\n\n\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17887\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f4-laynenorton2-1024x719.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"719\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f4-laynenorton2-1024x719.png 1024w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f4-laynenorton2-300x211.png 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f4-laynenorton2-768x540.png 768w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f4-laynenorton2-1536x1079.png 1536w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f4-laynenorton2.png 1822w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\nFigure 4. How amino acids are broken down and enter metabolism.

they just don’t like to chew as much\n\n\n\n“Instead of milk on your cereal, just put a protein shake… and boom, you’ve got 30 grams of protein instead of 8”— Layne Norton\n\nProtein shakes have come a long way, they are a lot tastier now\n\nShould she track fat and carbohydrates?\n\nPeter notes that this diet change has doubled her protein intake, which is almost an isocaloric switch\n\nShould we pay attention to what % carb versus fat this woman is eating when hypertrophy is the primary goal over the next 2 years?\n\n\nThe research on hypertrophy leads Layne to think as far as carbs and fats go, it mostly doesn’t matter as long as you’re not at the extreme of either\n\nIf you are very, very low fat, it can impair testosterone levels\nThis has not been shown to impair accrual of lean mass, but it hasn’t been well studied either\nFat is a difficult question when considered as a % of calories\n\nIf you’re eating 5,000 calories and 10% fat, this is probably enough fat\nAs you eat more calories you can spare fat from oxidation by utilizing more carbohydrates\n20% calories from fat is probably safe\nAt a minimum you want to eat 40 g of fat a day\n\n\nHe doesn’t want to be dogmatic about these numbers\n\n\n\nDiscussion of a ketogenic diet\n\nA ketogenic diet does appear to impair lean body mass accrual\n\nBut probably through a few different mechanisms\n\n\nEven though carbohydrates aren’t stimulatory for muscle protein synthesis, they do inhibit muscle protein degradation and fat doesn’t appear to have the same effect\n\nIt’s probably an insulin effect\nInsulin does inhibit muscle protein degradation\n\n\nIt’s almost impossible to be on a ketogenic diet and eat the amount of protein Layne’s talking about\n\nIt would be very difficult for to get high levels of beta hydroxybutyrate with the amount of protein that you would need to be in a positive nitrogen balance\n\n\nAlso notice that resistance training is anaerobic for the most part\n\nSo her glycolytic capacity goes down\n\n\nResearch about ultra endurance or even endurance (in terms of under 65-70% of a VO2 max) shows that a ketogenic diet is fine\n\nBut once you start getting over 65% VO2 max, there does seem to be a significant impairment in performance\nA couple of 12-week studies looked at lean body mass accrual and showed an impairment with the ketogenic diet\n\nLayne’s guess is it’s (1) through not inhibiting muscle protein degradation as much \n(2) just through not performing as well and they did show lower strength accrual in the ketogenic diet group\n\n\nRelevant studies:\n\nEfficacy of ketogenic diet on body composition during resistance training in trained men: a randomized controlled trial  \nEffects of a ketogenic diet on body composition and strength in trained women  \nEffects of resistance training combined with a ketogenic diet on body composition: a systematic review and meta-analysis\n\n\n\n\nPeter notes nothing extreme about her carb to fat ratio\nFor some people, carbs really increase their appetite, it creates brain fog, all sorts of things\n\nFor people in that camp, can they still go low carb?\n\n\nFor someone who tolerates carbohydrates very well, could they eat more carbs?\nDoes the carbohydrate content of the diet become secondary after the primary bucket of protein is filled?\n\nAbsolutely; protein and calories are the 2 most important things\nHow carbs and fat are distributed should be based on what you can adhere to and enjoy\n\n\nLayne could argue that brain fog or appetite might depend on the type of carbohydrate or might be placebo\nThere’s nothing wrong with low carb as long as it’s not extreme; it’s a balancing act\n\n“This is where nutrition communication really requires nuance”— Layne Norton\n\nSomeone may hear, “Layne’s saying you can’t gain muscle on the ketogenic diet”\n\nBut what he’s saying is you can’t gain as much, you can absolutely still gain muscle on a low carb/ketogenic diet\nThe same is true with intermittent fasting\n\nAre you going to build as much lean muscle?  Probably not\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to track in your diet\n\nIf your primary goal is gaining muscle mass, focus on protein, calories, and making sure you have enough carbohydrates\nIf your primary goal is to maintain body composition, you will put on a little less muscle mass on a low carb diet\nThis will really boil down to the individual and what you like best\nWhen people get overwhelmed with protein, carbs, and fats he recommends just tracking protein and calories\n\nProtein and calories are the big buckets\nIf you want to get more granular (with carbs and fats) you can\n\n\nLayne gets more granular because he doesn’t want his performance to fluctuate\n\nHe wants to be consistent in the amount of carbs and fats he eats [in addition to protein and calories]\nHe doesn’t want his body weight to fluctuate a ton\n\n\nMost people are getting 99% of the benefits by tracking just calories and protein \n\n \nDispelling myths that excess protein intake increases cancer risk through elevations in mTOR and IGF [1:55:30]\n\nLayne knows that many people have heard that mTOR and IGF-1 are bad\nDavid Sinclair said, “I really try to limit mTOR and IGF-1”\n\n“It will never cease to amaze me how many scientists do not understand the difference between a short-term, truncated acute response to a stressor versus dysregulated signaling that persists indefinitely”— Layne Norton\n\nmTOR elevations that lead to cancer and whatnot, those originate mostly via insulin resistance\n\nElevations in insulin result in insulin signaling through AKT (shown in pink in the figure below), which can then transmit to mTOR (shown in purple at the bottom of the figure)\nThis is pushing that button on a chronic, low level (as opposed to a pulsatile stimulus)\n\n\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17888\" src=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f5-laynenorton2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f5-laynenorton2.jpg 800w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f5-laynenorton2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://peterattiamd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/f5-laynenorton2-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" />\nFigure 5.

What would you say?\n\nYou’d think this couldn’t be good for you; don’t do it\n\n\nBut exercise is good for us\nExercise is a short-term stressor, it’s a controlled dose of a stressor that your body can handle\nThere’s a difference between an acute response and a chronic response\nIf you look at people with elevated inflammation, their inflammatory markers are not super high but are elevated all the time\n\nIt’s the chronic pulse that’s the problem\n\n\nFor the argument that there is a healthy user bias for people who have high rates of IGF-1 and mTOR\n\nThere is no evidence that they have a higher incidence of cancer\nThere are some confounding variables because people who have high levels of mTOR activation and IGF-1 typically have insulin resistance\n\nThey typically have poor dietary habits and lifestyles \nThese things are tied together \n\n\n\n\nLayne is not saying that mTOR plays no role, but it can’t be the cart before the horse sort of thing\n\nPeople will say Rapamycin is an mTOR inhibitor and that’s a cancer treatment drug\nBut is it a good idea to use chemotherapy to prevent cancer?\n\n\nPeter adds that Rapamycin has never been a particularly successful cancer therapeutic used constituently \n\nIt does show benefits for longevity in basically all animal models\nSo the extrapolation would be pulsatile rapamycin is probably beneficial\n\nBut in that application, it’s not really being taken to constantly suppress mTOR\nIf you took it all the time, you’re suppressing mTOR complex 2 and mTOR complex 1\n\n\n\n\nPeter agrees with the point that tissue specificity and time course are very difficult things to infer from the outside, which is sort of the meta view of all things equal\n\nIGF levels have a J curve with mortality and therefore very, very high levels of IGF must be problematic \nAnd high protein increases IGF and therefore must be bad\n\n\n\nDiet\n\nLayne points out, “we have this idea that like, there’s this perfect diet out there. That’s going to be the one diet that’s going to reduce cancer and cardiovascular disease and mortality and all that. And the fact is that there’s probably trade offs for everything.”\nThere are people that will say that protein increases cancer\n\nThere’s a ton of cofounders to that\nMeta-analysis looking at cancer and protein content of the diet look at above 70 g protein per day (1.2 g / kg body weight)\nMost Americans eat high protein according to the RDA definition but where is this from?\n\nBurgers, hot dogs, and processed meat\n\n\n What is the incidence of cancer in people who just have a high protein, but overall healthy diet?\n\nHere’s the thing, most people who eat high levels of meat eat low levels of fruits and vegetables\n\n\nLayne notes, “What they found was that at the highest levels of meat intake, but also with the highest levels of fruit and vegetable intake, there was no difference in cancer incidents between the lowest level of meat intake and even with the highest level of fruit and vegetable intake”\n\nSo high protein is not an issue in a healthy diet\nHe doesn’t want to extrapolate too much on 1 study (even though it was a large one), but it suggests that the quality of the overall diet is what is important\n\n\n\n\n\n“You can achieve good diet quality on a whole host of different diets”— Layne Norton\n\nYou can have a ketogenic diet that is very poor quality or high quality\n\nThe same is true for plant-based, intermittent fasting, etc.\n\n\nA lot of it boils down to: What are the food choices you’re making on balance? \n\nAre you getting enough fruits and vegetables and minerals and micronutrients?\n\n\nEvery time we try to say, fruits and vegetables have these benefits on health that we see pretty consistently, so let’s try and take out these isolated micronutrients and give them in the supplements\n\nWe’re always disappointed with the results\nWe have to eat the whole food to get those benefits\n\n\nIf the mTor story were true in terms of dietary protein, we would’ve expected in that study to see a linear increase in cancer, especially at each level of fruit and vegetable intake\n\nBut we didn’t\nWhat we saw was more of a linear inverse association with fruit and vegetable intake \n\n\n\n \nHypothetical case study #2: Training program for a 50-year-old, trained male wanting to increase muscle mass [2:04:00]\n\nHypothetical case study #2— a 40-50 year old male who wants to maximize his muscle mass\nThis male has a background in training and realizes that he is going to start losing muscle at a pretty good clip once he’s in his 50’s (and certainly by age 65) so he wants to build up as much reservoir as he can\nThis person has always been an athlete but never really thought about muscle mass\nThey have been consistently training\n\nBut they’re not in a progressive overload mindset\nThey’ve become comfortable in their training and haven’t really increased the weight in anything they’re doing in 5 years\n\n\nThey are lifting weights 3x a week for 1 hour each session\n\nThey squat, they deadlift, they do a whole body split every day for those 3 days\n\n\nLet’s say their DEXA scan is 20% fat\n\nSo they’re probably 25th percentile actually for a 50 year old\n\n\nTheir BMI is 27; technically, they’re a little bit overweight and have a little extra body fat\nThey want to know if they can be10% body fat in 2 years\n\nLayne’s prescription for strength-training \n\nFor his resistance training, he is doing 3 sets of 10 on everything\n\nSlap a plate on, slap 2 plates on and continue with the same thing \n\n\nWhen you want muscle to grow, you’re trying to induce adaptation\n\nAdaptation is never comfortable\n\n\n\n“Muscular hypertrophy is an adaptation to a stressor placed on the body”— Layne Norton\n\nThe stressor is volume and mechanical load\n\nSo either increase the weight, the repetitions, or the number of sets\nThis is going to be uncomfortable\n\nYou need to mentally gear-up for this discomfort\n\n\n\n\nIt sounds like he’s been doing big compound movements, Layne would continue this\n\nHe would like to get video feedback to see what his form is like\n\n\nAt this age it’s also about knowing when do we build in some tapers so that he can actualize those gains and recover as well\nThe thing about adaptation, at a certain point, if you’ve been training for long enough and you’re old enough, the amount that you need to cause adaptation versus what is going to cause you to overreach is going to become closer and closer and closer\nWhen you first get into training, you need almost nothing to adapt\n\nYou come in and do one set of leg extensions you will get an adaptation from that if you do it consistently for several weeks\n\n\nAfter you have been training 5 years, 1 set of leg extensions is going to do absolutely nothing\n\nThis might maintain what you have, but that’s it\n\n\nIf you want to push adaptation, you have to push harder, which is going to create more of a recovery deficit\nRecovery capacity is going to increase as you get older and have a greater training experience\n\nIt’s not going to increase as much as the amount of stress that you’re going to have to apply to adap\n\n\nHaving built in tapers is really important and whether you do them responsibly in terms of monitoring this person’s progress or  whether you build them in systematically to try and get ahead of that curve, either way can work\n\nTypical duration of a build cycle, taper cycle [2:09:00]\n\nThe taper cycle will get closer together the more advanced you get\nLayne’s situation is kind of unique\n\nHe gets his kids 1 week on, 1 week off\nHe’s noticed the week he has the kids, he gets less sleep and has a little more stress\n\nHis performance goes down a bit\nHe tracks bar velocity as well using a device called RepOne\nRepOne is an accelerometer; it’s about $400; it’s nerd stuff if you’re really dialed in\nHe tracks his performance in terms of strength, RPE, and speed\nAll these measures consistently show he’st not quite as good (he’s about 90 to 95% as good) on the weeks the kids are with him \n\n\nThis has built in micro cycles of tapering for him\n\n\nOverall through these micro cycles, we’re trying to walk up the volume and the progressive overload.\nAfter probably 4-8 weeks, he’ll do a much bigger taper where we pull back on everything\n\nBut we do micro tapers in between\nSo taper after about 4-8 weeks with this guy (hypothetical case study #2)\n\n\nFor this guy, split the difference and have him push for 6 weeks then back off\nLayne recommends backing off of both the volume and intensity a little bit\n\nMaybe he’s up to a 7, 8, 9 RPE on most sets\n\nRPE is the rate of perceived exertion (relative perceived effort)\nAn easy way to think about it is if it’s a 7 RPE on a set, then that person could’ve done 3 more reps before they hit absolute failure\nSo most RPEs to Layne (or advanced people) should be close to 7 or 8, with a few sets pushing into a 9; and very rarely should you push to a 10\nThere’s quite a bit of literature out there to show that you get basically the same hypertrophy training close to failure that you do going to absolute failure\nIt’s not necessarily that failure is bad; it’s just the amount of recovery deficit it creates is disproportionate to the stimulus\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMaximizing hypertrophy while minimizing fatigue—is it necessary to train to muscular failure? [2:11:30]\n\nLayne wants to maximize hypertrophy and stimulus while minimizing fatigue\n\nSure, you can get a similar stimulus by going to failure and maybe even just a little bit more\nBut if it then causes you to have decreased performance the following week or not be able to push as hard overall, we have to think about this as an overall training program and not just isolated workouts\n\n\nDr. Mike Israetel has talked about training shy of failure a lot on Instagram\n\nPeople will say this isn’t hard\nLayne replies, “one of my most impressive squat sets is I did 480 pounds for 14 reps and I’ve done 405 pounds for 21 reps before. I couldn’t move afterwards. First off it probably took me five minutes just to get my breath back, just to breathe enough to like be a functional human after that. Then as far as like going to do another set, first off when I hit that 480 and I grinded out that last rep, that 14th rep, I was so fatigued I couldn’t rack the right side of the barbell… And then I laid down for five minutes just trying to get my breath back. And then when I got up, if you told me I had to go squat 480 again, I’m telling you I couldn’t have gotten a single rep. Even after resting 10, 15 minutes. There’s not a chance in hell. So you’re telling me if I stopped two reps shy of that, that that would’ve felt easy. You’re insane.”\n\n\n\n“With compound movements specifically, you don’t have to get as close to failure to get the benefits”— Layne Norton\nStimulus for muscle growth [2:14:45]\n\nResearch shows that what was popular a few years ago was the effective reps hypothesis\n\nThe idea is that the majority of the stimulus for muscle growth occurs in the last 5 reps before failure\nIf you’re doing 20 reps, this means you need to get to at least 15 reps to get a similar stimulus\n\n\nIn terms of volume and progressive overload, you really need to think about volume in terms of just the number of hard sets within a 5 RPE (rate of perceived exertion)\nBut the research shows this is much more accurate for isolation stuff than it is for compound\nSo compound lifts are kind of their own beast\n\n“You can train at a sub-5 RPE and still get maximal EMG recruitment and quite a bit of hypertrophy”— Layne Norton\n\nIn contrast, with isolation, you have to train close to failure\nAlso note, the exercises are not equivalent\n\nCompare a 5 RPE squat and a 9 RPE leg extension\n\nLayne can do 9 RPE on leg extension all day\nPeter agrees, this is infinitely less painful\nA squat is a big compound movement that requires core and stabilization and breathing and creating intraabdominal pressure, all that kind of stuff factors into fatigue\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIdeal sets and reps for the hypothetical 50-year-old male interested in hypertrophy [2:16:15]\n\nOur guy is more interested in hypertrophy than strength; he’s not going to powerlift\nLayne suggests variety; research shows that from 1 rep to 30 reps, you can build very similar amounts of muscle\n\nPeter notes this is amazing, conventional wisdom says doing fewer than 6 reps would only add to strength and not hypertrophy\nLayne notes, “There are benefits to being in that hypertrophy rep range of six to 15 reps, that’s kind of like traditional”\n\n\nBenefits of doing 6-15 reps\n\nOne of the nice things about the 6-15 reps is you can accumulate quite a bit of metabolic fatigue\nYou can use relatively heavy loads\nYou can get quite a bit of volume in that rep range\n\n\nIf you’re doing really heavy weights for under 5 reps\n\nPeter asks if you would have to double your number of sets jut to get the volume right\nNo because it’s more about the number of hard sets\nBut doing a hard set of 5 is not the same as doing a hard set of 10\nBut some people don’t like training with a high number of reps; it gets boring\n\n\nTraining adherence is #1\nIf he likes lifting heavy weights but isn’t worried about creating strength he can:\n\nDo 1 set under 5 reps \nAnd the rest at 6-10 reps for compound exercises\nOn isolation exercises he’ll do 15-20 reps, just for variety\n\n\nResearch for short term gains (12 weeks) indicates he won’t see a difference in hypertrophy between low reps up to 30 reps as long as the number of hard sets are equated\n\n“So really it says, is do what you like, do what you enjoy”— Layne Norton\n\nThe sweet spot for hard sets is probably about 6 to 10 sets in a session (per body part)\n\nThey don’t really see improvements above 10 sets\nNow this gets a little bit complicated because if you rest longer, each set actually becomes more effective as a stimulus for hypertrophy\n\nPresumably because you perform better and you can use more weight and do more reps on that individual set\n\n\n\n\nJames Krieger did a good meta-regression\n\nPublished in the Journal of Sports Sciences in 2017, Dose-response relationship between weekly resistance training volume and increases in muscle mass: A systematic review and meta-analysis\nIf you’re resting more than 3 minutes between sets, 6 sets (resting 1-2 minutes) might be more like 10 sets \nKeep in mind, you don’t have to just jump to 10 sets immediately per body part, that’s a lot of sets\n\n\nYou should probably use whatever is allowing you to adapt at the time\nIf you are relatively new to training, you start doing 10 sets per body part\n\n1) What’s going to happen once you plateau? That’s a lot more sets you’re going to have to add on top of that\n2) You’re probably going to outpace your recovery capabilities.\nIf you are squatting and deadlifting every day, you better be in very good physical condition to do that; and even then there is an expiry date on that\n\n\nPeter has never tried to do squats or deadlift every day\n\nHe’s not willing to give up so many other things exercise-wise to do so\nWhat he’s noticed is people who do this are being very clever; every day is not a crushing set \n\nSome of those days, it’s a very, very low volume, low intensity that functions effectively as a recovery day where they’re basic working on the muscle memory in the form\n\n\n\n\nFor case study #2, he’s currently doing 3, 60-minute workouts a week, but he’s willing to do more\n\nHis form is decent\nYou’re not concerned about overuse\n\n\nIf he’s not looking to power lift, Layne doesn’t care about exercise selection\n\nHe’s probably not going to be doing a lot of free squatting and deadlifting even though that’s Layne’s personal love \n\nThose create a very high recovery debt; and they’re very mentally taxing\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMaximizing hypertrophy by working a muscle at a long muscle length [2:22:15]\n\nIt’s also very important to work a muscle at a long muscle length\n\nThere was a recent meta-analysis looking at partial range of motion, but partial range of motion at different muscle lengths \nPublished in the European Journal of Sport Science in 2021, Partial range of motion training elicits favorable improvements in muscular adaptations when carried out at long muscle lengths\nSee also, Effects of range of motion on resistance training adaptations: A systematic review and meta-analysis \nThey found that while partial range of motion at shortened muscle lengths does not produce the same hypertrophy as full range of motion\nPartial range of motion at lengthened muscle lengths produce similar hypertrophy as full range of motion\n\n\nConsider the biceps, because it is lengthened when your arm is straight \n\nIs a partial rep from straight to say 90 degrees is more effective than if you just do the top of the bicep, with the same range of motion?\n\nPresumably you wouldn’t see as much adaptation or muscle recruitment with a shorter range of motion \n\n\nLayne notes that the bicep might be a little bit different because you would actually have to be on an incline bench to truly get the stretched range of motion \n\nIn a traditional dumbbell curl, the top end is actually the more difficult component of the rep\nIf you pre-stretch it, now you can make that bottom part a little more difficult\n\n\n\n\nIf you think about something like a squat, a partial range of motion squat\n\nIf you’re doing a partial range of motion in the bottom half, that is not going to be easy\n\n\nIt’s more about working the muscle in the difficult regions, but the stretch component does seem to be important\n\n \nRecommended lower body exercise routines and tips about training frequency [2:24:00]\n\nLayne is a big fan of something like a hack squat for leg development \n\nIf you don’t care about being strong on free squats,\n\n\nIf you get a good machine, you can take it through a really full range of motion; you can really get a good stimulus for the quadriceps and some of the rest of the leg muscle\nThere’s also really good pendulum squats\n\nIt’s kind of like you sit in a seat, it’s on an arm\nAs you’re getting lower, it gets a little bit easier because of the pendulum\nAnd then as you get higher, it gets harder, which actually works on your strength curve \n\nBecause the hardest part of the squat is near the bottom and the easiest part is near the top\n\n\n\n\nWith these 2 exercises you can really work through a nice full range of motion and create a lot of stimulus\n\nHe usually likes to have 2 main exercises for a big muscle group like that\n\n\n\n“I think full range of motion or training in that stretched position is very, very important”— Layne Norton\n\nYou probably don’t need 2 exercises; you probably could just do hack squats for 5 or 6 set\nBut people like variety; Layne would keep those between a 6-8 RPE and then go to a leg extension and leg curl and those sorts of things\nAdditionally, he’d probably do some sort of RDL because it’s not as fatiguing as a deadlift, but you’re still activating similar muscles\n\nKeep that between a 6–8 RPE\n\n\nPeter asks, “Are you going to coach that with one leg? Are you going to do Ipsi or ISO grab on the kettlebell?”\nLayne would probably do a barbell, do both legs\n\nIf there was some imbalance or you wanted variety, you could do single let\nIf muscular hypertrophy is the primary goal, you can create more stimulus using both legs at the same time\n\n\nFollow this up with some isolation stuff, low-rest periods, higher reps, 10 to 20 repetitions going to a little bit higher RPE (8-9 RPE).\nIf you’ve just got to take a set to failure, take the last out of the last exercise of an isolation to failure \nThe bigger compound exercise is a little bit lower reps can be used, maybe 5-10\n\nThen as you progress through more isolation, go into the higher end of the rep range and maybe taking some a little bit closer to failure \n\n\n\nHow many days per week should case study #2 strength-train?\n\nIn terms of frequency\n\nMeta-analysis hasn’t been sensitive enough to pick it up\nSo far as we know, for legs, it doesn’t matter; 1 time a week is enough\nFor upper-body, 2 times a week \nMultiple times a week is probably beneficial for both\n\n\nPeter notes Layne’s PH3 program is 5 days a week\n\nYes: 3 days of squatting, 2 days of deadlift, 3 days of bench pressing (and accessory on those days too)\n\n\nFrequency is more of a tool to distribute volume than it is an individual hypertrophy stimulus\n\nIt makes sense to Layne that if you have a muscle protein synthesis response (especially in trained individuals,) that’s only 16, 20, 24 hours, then multiple doses of that are probably better than just doing one dose and thinking you’ve got it all\n\nWe don’t have enough studies yet and we don’t have the sensitivity to detect that\nStudies are also so heterogeneous in terms of the population studied, training status, types of exercises used, how RPE is measured, how intensity is measured, how volume is measured\n\n\n\n\nLayne notes, “The amount of hypertrophy research that’s come out in the last five to 10 years is literally an explosion compared to pre 2010”\n\nHe read just 1 meta-analysis on hypertrophy from resistance training in the entire time he was in graduate school\n\n\n\nRecommended reading\n\nPeter asks what meta-analysis he would recommend for those who want to wade through the research\nStudies by James Krieger look at set number and volume\n\nPublished in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research in 2010, Single vs. multiple sets of resistance exercise for muscle hypertrophy: a meta-analysis\nPublished in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research in 2017, Strength and Hypertrophy Adaptations Between Low- vs. High-Load Resistance Training: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis\n\n\nBut putting out an actual program day to day is difficult because a lot of it boils down to personal preference \n\n \nNutrition plan for the hypothetical 50-year old male wanting to add muscle [2:29:00]\n\nLet’s say our 40-50 year old male weighs 175-180 lbs\nHe’s 20ish% body fat by DEXA\nHe’s eating 120 g protein a day\n\nThis is a little light on protein\nHe is willing to eat anything you say\n\n\n\n“I would say you’re not having any downsides to having 200 grams a day. And that’s a nice number to shoot for.”— Layne Norton\n\nLayne also wants to make sure his calories and carb intake are adequate for facilitating recovery\nThis guy wants to gain lean mass, Peter asks, “How do you think about cycling him in terms of making him hyper caloric?”\n\nWhat should his target be for energy balance?\nHow much weight should he gain?\n\n\nSince he’s been training for a long time and he’s older, the likelihood that he’s going to be able to gain lean mass without at least some body fat is probably pretty low\n\nIf this were the lady in the first case study who had never trained before, this would be no problem\n\nShe’s going to gain some muscle and lose some fat\n\n\nWhen you’ve been training for a long period of time, you have to have everything lined up just to gain ounces of lean body mass\n\nPart of lining that up is a slight caloric surplus\n\n\n\n\nThere is a new meta-analysis that came out that showed that an energy deficit (it’s not quite the same thing) impairs lean body mass accrual\n\nPublished in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports in 2022, Energy deficiency impairs resistance training gains in lean mass but not strength: A meta-analysis and meta-regression\nThis makes sense because in an energy deficit there are decreased rates of basal protein synthesis\nFrom a mechanistic perspective, it activates AMP-kinase, which is an inhibitor of mTOR\nFrom a teleological perspective, if you don’t have excess energy, muscle remodeling is extremely energy expensive\n\n\nPeter rephrases this, “if you’re going to eat 1,000 calories a day, you could probably better off having them be as much protein as possible, but just because you have 200 grams of protein in your diet, if the calories are exceptionally low, you’re probably losing lean mass.”\n\nLayne isn’t worried about 1 day of energy deficit\nBut if someone ate just 1,000 calories a day, virtually all protein in an effort to get as lean as possible without losing lean mass\n\nLayne notes you might be able to not lose lean mass\nBut the likelihood you would gain lean mass is very, very low for someone who has been training for a while\n\n\n\n\n\n“The more advanced you get, the more things you have to have lined up correctly to continue to push”— Layne Norton\nLayne’s experience powerlifting\n\nLayne was in the 230-pound class for powerlifting back in 2019, and he just started to drop back down to his original weight class of 205 pounds\n\nHe did that over the course of about a year\nBut that was taken in sprints\nHe would do fat-loss sprints\n\nFor example, he would do 2 or three 3 of a pretty aggressive deficit, 750 to 1,000 calories a day to lose 5-6 lbs\nThen he would shift to maintenance for the same amount of time\nHe built this into his lifestyle\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks what body fat is best for his performance, surely not 7%\n\nLayne can maintain pretty well and perform at 7%\n\n\nLayne and his coaches use diet breaks, where people are eating at maintenance\n\nSo if you’re going on vacation, have a diet break for 2 weeks then do a fat-loss sprint\n\n\n\n \nCycling weight gain and weight loss when building lean muscle mass, and expectations for progress over time [2:33:30]\n\nThis man should eat a slight caloric surplus for about 8 weeks to gain 3 lbs of body weight\nNext maintain this for a little while to make sure he doesn’t put on extra fat\n\nLet his body adjust\n\n\nThen do another 6-8 weeks\nFat loss should be slow for people who are well trained\nWeight gain should occur at a snail’s pace\nAs a rule of thumb, if he’s going to gain 5 lbs of total body weight, aim for 3 lb to be lean\n\nThis will probably take 12 weeks\nBut it might be more like 6 months\n\nAt 12 weeks he’s up to 5 lbs but then he works on reducing a bit of fat and comes back down to a gain of only 3 lbs\nThis could be followed by another gaining cycle\n\n\n\n\nWith each cycle, the composition of lean tissue to fat gets a little bit better\n\nThis is Layne’s anecdotal experience from coaching\n\n\nWhen trained people put on weight it is often 50-50, lean mass to fat mass\n\nSometimes it’s 40-60, if you’re really well trained (40% lean, 60% fat)\n\n\nPeter notes, it’s important to tell this guy, “Hey, if you’re going to be rigorously following body comp, don’t be disappointed if your body fat goes up in that cycle”\nLayne compares it to investing, and playing the long game\n\nYour taking money away from this immediate moment so hopefully you have more money later\n\n\n\nIs there a limit to the amount of muscle that can be gained?\n\nThe good thing is that when we lose body fat for resistance training, loss of body fat get a little better each cycle\n\nNow, there are limits to this, your genetic limit\nYou never really know if you’re at your genetic limit\n\n\nLayne shows people a picture of himself at 21 years old, where he had been resistance training hard for 3-4 years\n\nMost people would say he was at his genetic limit\nThen he shows a picture of himself now, at age 40\nThe difference in his leg musculature and overall musculature is enormous (from age 21-40)\nBut if you looked year by year, you would see very little difference\n\n\n\n“You might think you’re at your genetic limit, but you’re probably not; and it’s probably more like a asymptote”— Layne Norton\n\nYou never really hit a hard limit, rather the gains become some minimal it’s almost not measurable\nThis male should focus on making sure they can do a lot of resistance training\n\nBecause it’s going to take quite a big stimulus to get in there, focusing on stimulus versus fatigue\nDo high stimulus, low fatigue movements so that they can accumulate enough volume without overreaching all the time\nIf they can train for 12 weeks without needing a taper versus six weeks, that’s more stimulus\n\n\nEat a slight caloric surplus, 200 calories a day over maintenance\n\nThis means there will be weeks where he doesn’t gain anything\n\n\nWeight gain tends to come on in chunks\n\nJust like weight loss occurs in chunks\n\n\nWhat tends to happen is people get really frustrated because the weight comes on so slow that they end up just throwing down a bunch of calories so that they can say they gain the weight \n\nAnd this doesn’t go well\n\n\nLayne notes, “You can be stable, stable, stable, even though you’re in a calorie surplus. Then all of a sudden, boom, your weight’s up 2 pounds randomly and it sticks.”\nHe should look at the month to month average during the  gaining phase to see if he’s hitting his milestones\n\n \nSupplements to aid in hypertrophy training [2:38:30]\nProtein powder\n\nHow does whey protein stack up in the hierarchy of proteins?\n\nWhat other sources should we look at?\n\n\nWhey protein is high in leucine, branched amino acids [the ones that can be utilized by muscle], and essential amino acids  \n\nIt generally tastes good and is well tolerated\nPeople will have difficulty tolerating a straight whey concentrate but a blend of concentrate and isolate is what is mostly out there (and is tolerated well)\n\n\nWhey comes from cow’s milk\n\nCentrifuge off the fat, take what is left over and precipitate out the casein (the non-soluble fraction of milk), and the soluble portion that is left over is whey\n\n\nWhey mostly consists of proteins called lactalbumins\n\nIt’s a high-quality, easily digestible, very bioavailable source of protein\nIt’s top in terms of muscle protein synthesis; it always scores highest in his research\n\nThere was no statistical difference from egg protein\nMaybe if you had a higher subject number you could pick out some statistical difference between whey and egg\nBut people like whey a little bit better\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks what brand he thinks is best\nShameless plug— Layne has his own supplement line, Outwork Nutrition\nHe has a whey protein isolate (outward nutrition build); isolates are a little bit more expensive than a concentrate isolate blend, but it is better for sensitivities\n\nThere are people with lactose intolerance\nThere are people with sensitivity to the lactalbumins\nAn isolate is generally well tolerated\nSome people with really high sensitivity to the lactalbumins can’t tolerate an isolate\n\nIf that’s the case, they could probably do a hydrolyzate, which is a little more expensive and doesn’t taste as good, but still a good option for those that with a really sensitive GI\nSo it’s just low carbohydrate, low lactose, low fat, high protein, high leucine. So I think our leucine contents over 11 per, I think it’s actually 12%, which is very high. And then the carbohydrate content, depending on vanilla or chocolate is like one to four grams. And then the fat content is less than a gram of fat. In fact, the vanilla is zero.\n\n\n\n\nOther brands Layne trusts include: Legion, Optimum, EAS\n\nRecommendations for reading labels\n\nHe recommends avoiding proprietary blends\n\n“Proprietary blends are usually just a way for people to hide stuff”— Layne Norton\n\nYou also want to avoid products that are doing what’s called nitrogen spiking\n\nYou can pump up the protein and nitrogen content by adding individual amino acids that cost less than just the whey protein itself\n\nSuch as glycine\n\n\nSometimes creatine is added; not that creatine isn’t good but you’re taking away protein \n\nThis is another way to cut costs and increase the protein content\n\n\n\n\n\nBranched-chain amino acids\n\nPeter asks, “Is there utility in using branched-chain amino acids specifically in workouts where these are typically coming as far lower doses, right?”\n\nThey’re typically 5 g per serving\nBranched-chain amino acids are the only ones muscle can oxidize for energy, they are: leucine, isoleucine, and valine\n\n\n\n“So this was something that I’ve changed my mind on”— Layne Norton\n\nLayne did his PhD on leucine\nHe used to think branched chain amino acids are useful, but he can’t support that anymore\nIf you’re getting enough total protein in, it doesn’t seem to be benefit to supplement with branched-chain amino acids\nThey may have a role in reducing muscle soreness\n\nBut this has never been compared with a similar amount of whey protein\n\n\nMaybe branched-chain amino acids would be good for someone who cannot get enough high quality protein in\n\nMaybe if you’re a vegan or on a plant-based diet\n\n\nLayne did a study where he looked at whey protein versus wheat protein\n\nHe saw that whey protein triggered a bigger response in muscle protein synthesis compared to wheat protein\nPublished in the Journal of Nutrition in 2009, The leucine content of a complete meal directs peak activation but not duration of skeletal muscle protein synthesis and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in rats\nGram per gram, isonitrogenous difference in muscle protein synthesis when rats ate whey versus wheat protein\nWhen he added leucine [to the wheat protein] to match the leucine content of the whey, he got the exact same response\n\n\nPeter asks about supplementing with leucine, 5 g leucine\n\nBy the way it tastes horrible (Layne agrees)\nLayne doesn’t see any benefit in this; he wished he did\nHe did his PhD on leucine and was hoping to find the secret anabolic trigger and get enough protein\n\n\n\nCreatine\n\nCreatine monohydrate used to be very popular\n\n30 g a day for loading, and then a maintenance phase of 5 g a day\n\n\nWhat you want to do is saturate your phosphocreatine stores in muscle cells\n\nYou can do that through loading; it will saturate in 5-7 days\n\nThe downside to loading is GI discomfort, bloating\n\n\nIf you do it through maintenance, it will take about 3-4 weeks\n\n\nThe benefits of creatine are boosting strength, hypertrophy, and recovery\n\nIt increases lean body mass, strength, and exercise performance\nThere may be cognitive benefits\n\n\nDon’t get caught up in the hype of other forms of creatine\nCreatine monohydrate has been shown to saturate the muscle cell 100%\n\nYou cannot get more than 100%\nOther forms of creatine are simply in existence to remove more money from your wallet\nEverybody has creatine in their supplement line; the margins are so thin; nobody makes money on straight creatine\n\n\nLayne has a supplement called Recovery and creatine is one of the ingredients there\n\nIt has 5 g of creatine monohydrate\n\n\nYou probably don’t need to take creatine on your off-days from lifting\nPeter asks, “If you’re doing cardio on a non-lifting day, do you benefit at all from creatine there?”\nThis hasn’t been studied\nCreatine is very cheap so your not missing out on anything by having an extra dose\n\nHe would take it daily\nIf your budget is really thin, take it only on days you train\n\n\n\nNitrates and nitric oxide\n\nNitrates, nitrites do appear to enhance exercise performance\n\nBeetroot juice and those sorts of things and sources of nitrites\n\n\nThere was a recent meta-analysis looking at the effect of dietary nitrates and the effect size was actually pretty impressive for power \n\nPublished in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition in 2021, Effect of dietary nitrate on human muscle power: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis\nThey found an average increase in muscle power of 5%\n\n5% is the difference between first and last, if you’re talking about the Olympics\n\n\nThe effect size was a 0.42, which isn’t considered a large effect size, but it’s approaching a modest effect size\n\nFor supplements, this is really impressive; it’s got to be close to the effect of creatine\n\n\n\n\nA lot of supplements appear to not have in them what they say they have in them in terms of these nitrates\n\nCitrulline\n\nAlso, something like citrulline malate can be recycled into arginine and then into nitric oxide\n\nSo citrulline malate or citrulline specifically, actually increases blood nitrate levels more than arginine itself\n\nThis is because citrulline is much more bioavailable\nArginine is mostly extracted by the splanchnic tissues— the gut, liver\n\n\n\n\n If you’re looking at citrulline specifically, take 6-8 g per dose\n\nHis pre-workout powder has 6 g\n\n\nCitrulline is taken more to increase performance than hypertrophy\n\nPresumably if your performance goes up, you have more stimulus; you might see the gains there\nThere is some evidence that citrulline can actually stimulate mTOR, but I’m not sure it’s enough to actually create hypertrophy on its own\n\n\n\nTiming of supplements\n\nPre-workout— citrulline\nPost-workout— whey protein\nWhen should creatine be taken?\n\nThe timing doesn’t seem to be important\nThinking about the mechanism, it shouldn’t matter because it’s a long term thing\n\n\nLayne included creatine in the recovery product and not pre-workout for a couple reasons\n\n1) There is not an immediate effect from creatine; it might have a little bit better effect post workout\n2) Some things in the pre-workout product are semi gut-irritants for some people and creatine can be a gut irritant, so they didn’t want to compound that effect\n\nA lot of pre-workout mixes do contain creatine\nWhen creatine is paired with a large dose of caffeine, it can cause a lot of GI discomfort\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks what he drinks during the workout\n\nGatorade Zero ro something similar, and water\n\n\nIf you’re working out for 2-3 hours at a time, maybe it’s useful to get some glucose and carbohydrate in to maintain performance\nBodybuilders or weightlifters tend to overestimate how difficult their workouts actually are\nYou only need to worry about the speed of glycogen resynthesis if you’re doing multiple events per day\n\nIf you’re a bodybuilder, it’s going to be 24 hours until your training; you’re going to resynthesize that glycogen as long as you get enough total carbohydrates\n\n\nHe’s not real huge on intra-workout nutrition, as long as we’re not talking about really long workouts or multiple sessions per day\n\n§Selected Links / Related MaterialPrevious podcast with Layne: #163 – Layne Norton, Ph.D.: Building muscle, losing fat, and the importance | Host Peter Attia,  The Peter Attia Drive Podcast (May 24, 2021) | [0:45, 1:31:00, 1:334:00]\nStudy by Levine in 1999 overfeeding people and observing their total energy expenditure and weight gain: Role of nonexercise activity thermogenesis in resistance to fat gain in humans | Science (JA Levine, NL Eberhardt, and MD Jensen 1999) | [19:00]\nAccuracy of wrist devices that track energy expenditure: Accuracy in Wrist-Worn, Sensor-Based Measurements of Heart Rate and Energy Expenditure in a Diverse Cohort | Journal of Personalized Medicine (A Shcherbina et al. 2017) | [23:30]\nTracking energy expenditure of people who self-report as resistant to weight loss: Discrepancy between Self-Reported and Actual Caloric Intake and Exercise in Obese Subjects | The New England Journal of Medicine (SW Lichtman et al. 1992) | [24:45]\nLayne’s website Team Biolayne: Biolayne: Layne Norton.
