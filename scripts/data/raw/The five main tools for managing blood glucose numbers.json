And that’s because I used to be exercising nearly 28 hours a week and now I’m exercising maybe 10 hours a week\n\n\nAgain, you’re just going to basically tweak these interventions based on your starting point and your aspiration\n\nSleep\n\nSleep cannot be overlooked\nThe data for poor sleep and insulin resistance are actually quite strong (see Matthew Walker episode)\nEven short-term bouts of sleep deprivation, like two weeks of four hours of sleep per night result in about a 50% reduction in glucose disposal which would result in hyperglycemia\nSleep deprivation is particularly insidious because it affects other things downstream like you motivation to exercise, your willpower to not eat crappy food, stress/anxiety levels, etc. \n\n§"
