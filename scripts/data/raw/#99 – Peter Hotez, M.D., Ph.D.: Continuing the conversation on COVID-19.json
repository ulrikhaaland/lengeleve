  "title": "#99 – Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.: Continuing the conversation on COVID-19",
  "content": "In this episode, Dr. Peter Hotez M.D., Ph.D., Dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine Baylor College of Medicine, returns to continue the conversation on COVID-19. Dr. Hotez informs us on how we can gauge the number of infected people, behaviors to reduce the probability of becoming infected, and the inconsistency of hospitalizations among young adults between different countries. Dr. Hotez underscores the continued uncertainty in many virus-related developments, but ends with some points of optimism.\nDisclaimer: This is information accurate as of March 19, 2020, when it was recorded.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#99 - Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.: Continuing the conversation on COVID-19\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#99 - Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.: Continuing the conversation on COVID-19\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#99 - Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.: Continuing the conversation on COVID-19\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nHow to gauge true number of infected people [5:45];\nReducing the probability of getting infected [22:45];\nInconsistency by country in infected young people [27:15];\nConferred immunity, seasonality, and repurposed therapeutics [30:30];\nVaccine development [39:30]; \nPractical behaviors to reduce risk of transmission [46:00];\nMental health resource and funding [51:00];\nPoints of optimism [56:00]; and\nMore.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEpisodes\n\t\n\t\n\t\tNow playing\n\t\n\t\n\t\tDetails\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\tThe impact of stress on our physical and emotional health | Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D. (#51 rebroadcast)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe impact of stress on our physical and emotional health | Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D. (#51 rebroadcast)\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe impact of stress on our physical and emotional health | Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D. (#51 rebroadcast)\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n View the Show Notes Page for This Episode  Become a Member to Receive Exclusive Content  Sign Up to Receive Peter’s Weekly Newsletter In this episode, Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D., discusses the widespread impact of stress on our physical and emotional health as well as the mechanisms by which it can precipitate chronic illness, dementia, depression, and more.

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

healthcare workers are getting sick\n\nWhat is the solution for staff workers getting sick?\n\nHeavily-hit Covid19 areas are likely experiencing understaffed medical support\nThe whole healthcare system was fragile to begin with due to high demand on physicians \nThere is no clear solution\n\nCould we expand the U.S. public health service? \n\nBring in individuals to train as medics who are currently under Furlow?\n\nReducing the probability of getting infected [22:45]\nHow much insight do we have about transmissibility?\n\nThere is not a lot of new information about virus survival time on various surfaces \nWe know that it can live on cardboard but how relevant is that?\n\nCDC came out with guidelines that loosened criteria of exposure \nA desperate move to have people remain in the workforce \nConvalescent serum could help people remain in the workforce as a form of prophylaxis \n\n\nWhite House came out with press report to create convalescent serum \n\n\nThe recent study of blood type and susceptibility: not clear how relevant it is yet \n\nStudy out of china showing that type O blood type had reduced risk \nProtective antibodies but not immunity like a convalescent serum\n\n\n\nInconsistency by country in infected young people [27:15]\n\nYounger age group in Italy getting ill but not seen in China  \nHigh number of hospitalized people between 20-40 years old, accounting for ~33% of hospitalizations in the U.S.\n~50% in the U.S. are under the age of 54 years old – very different than what was observed in China \n\nIndividuals aren’t dying at as high rates as older population groups but they are still hospitalized \nCould this be due to vaping?\n\n\n\n\nRequire good epidemiology on young patients to identify differences \n\nConferred immunity, seasonality, and repurposed therapeutics [30:30]\n\nNon-human primates show that once exposed, the infection should confer immunity \nThe federal government thinks that the pandemic should last 18 months\n\nOperating under the assumption that the virus comes back in the fall\nOr could be anticipating that there is a vaccine in 17 months, but Peter does not think this is realistic\nPeter hopes that the model is not dependent on vaccine development\n\n\n\nRepurposed drugs…\n\nPublished Kaletra paper interpretation: drugs administered when viral progression is too far gone is not helpful \nDidier Raoul preliminary work has looked at hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) \n\nSmall study reveals HCQ potential but has yet to be rigorously tested\n\n\n\nWe are on a steep learning curve around ARB and mechanistic action …\n\nARBs have the ability to block viral entry but on the other hand, it may upregulate ACE2 receptor\nThey may have anti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary look on camostat out of Japan seems promising\n\nVaccine development [39:30] \nShould we be considering a universal coronavirus vaccine rather than SARS or Covid-19 specific?\nPractical behaviors to reduce risk of transmission  [46:00]\n\nPeter Hotez does not believe receiving mail to be an issue \nReal risk is close, personal contact with someone infected \n\nMental health resource and funding [51:00]\n“The psychological devastation on the United States […] is going to be almost as big as the damage of the infection.” —Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.\nPoints of optimism [56:00]\n\nWe are seeing scientists put at higher esteem\nAt times of stress, people are looking to scientists and in leadership roles\nScience communication and data sharing has improved\n\n“The heroism we are seeing of physicians of nurses… there is going to be a new awakening behind the medical community…” —Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D.\n§"
