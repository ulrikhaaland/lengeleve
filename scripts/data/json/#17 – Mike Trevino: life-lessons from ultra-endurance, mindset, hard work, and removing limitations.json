What did you do athletically?\n\nIowa, played football player and wrestler\nStarted riding a bike at 4 years old, started doing 50-100 mile rides by age 10-12\nCompleted RAGBRAI ride across Iowa in 1987 at age 12, 400 miles\nDream was to play football at Notre Dame\nHe was an O-lineman in HS, played inside linebacker in college (not at Notre Dame)\n\nHow did you transition from power athlete to endurance athlete?\n\nWasn’t planned\nDecided to quit football, played some rugby, and finished school early\nFirst job was at a startup in Heidelberg, Germany\nGot invited to play on a semi-pro Rugby team, their practices were runs through the mountains, he fell in love with trail running",

He went for a run (yes, really, he did)\n“Running for me has always been my meditation . . . I get centered”\nHe decided to finish the race and took 2nd place\n\nSleep deprivation\n\nThe normal daily strategy that people take is on the bike for 20-22 hours, and sleep for 2-4 hours\nBut Mike only slept around 10.5 hours over the 8 days\nAt one point Robič told Mike, “you’re going to win, you don’t need sleep” after seeing how little rest Mike was taking\nAt one point, the lack of sleep starting causing hallucinations and he even thought, why is there a van following me? (It was his crew) And he tried to “lose them” — more about this story at 1:23:00\nBut Mike has since realized the importance of sleep\n“Sleep, I found, is more important than food and hydration when it comes to thermoregulation, muscle glycogen restoration, synapse repair and formation . . . I was clinically insane by the end of the race”\nThere’s a story in the New York Times about sleep deprivation and the RAAM\n\nMike gets advice from Pete Penseyres, a guy who held the RAAM record 27 years, 15.4 mph average speed for 8.5 days (includes off the bike time), probably more like 20 mph on the bike\n\nHe said that 2 things that will determine if you can win RAAM:\n\n\nWhat is your speed after you’ve depleted muscle glycogen and you’re just cruising: your “all-day” speed\nWhat’s your REM sleep cycle? So he would have someone watch his eye patterns while he slept and then wake him up immediately following his REM cycle: if you are woken up during REM you will feel sleepy — if your REM cycles were only 90 minutes, as opposed to say 2.5 hours, you could win RAAM\n\n\nThis is like sleep engineering\nPete Penseyres also advised him to “stay liquid” to let your body do little digestion\n\nMindset, nutrition, fasting, and other advice from Mike for those looking to take the next step in their training [49:00]\nMindset is first\n\nWe all have natural ability, all of us are born as athletes\nKnow that you have in you, somewhere, the ability to do great things\nChange your mindset, change your perspective on what you think you can do, you have the innate ability to do amazing things, it’s just that most people haven’t figured out how to tap into that\n\nCheck your assumptions at the door\n\nBe open to all possibilities and realize that not everything you’ve been told is right\nMike was told that you shouldn’t do more than 2 marathons a year and at one point he was doing a marathon per day\nHe trained himself for desert runs by sitting in a sauna all day, chugging water, taking salts for electrolytes\n\nKnow when to push, and when to pull back\n\nMike learned to use objective measures to judge himself: time, heart rate, power (on the bike)\nIf he wasn’t performing well, didn’t feel right, he would dial it back\nIf his heart rate wasn’t looking right, he wouldn’t train\nDon’t try to make up for “missed runs” or training time, you’ll overdo it\n\nNutrition\n\nIf you are an ultra distance athlete you HAVE to be fat adapted\nDon’t want to be doing this with an respiratory quotient above .75 to .8",

I could see around myself . . . I could feel stuff . . . I could smell stuff” (in ketosis)\nNot only did it fix his parasite problem, he was also developing exercise-induced asthma, became allergic to certain foods, and all this went away in 2003, by fasting\nBy day 7 he started training again because he felt good\nHe then realized if he used oil and fasting, he could perform even better by just “throwing everything else out the window”\nPeter says there’s little downside to try fasting, coupled with medical therapy, for parasites\nPeter also says there’s certainly evidence to suggest that fasting coupled with chemo helps chemo work better, demonstrated by Valter Longo and Dom D’Agostino (note: Longo’s done more work with fasting and response to chemotherapy; D’Agostino’s focus is more on a ketogenic diet in combination with hyperbaric oxygen therapy)\n\nThe risks involved with cycling [1:03:00]\n\nJust like mountain climbers attempting Everest and K2 have a risk of death (approx. 1 in 8, and 1 in 3, respectively), cycling too, comes with serious risk\nBoth Bob Breedlove and Jure Robič died in cycling accidents\nMike doesn’t ride as much now that he has family\nPeter’s wake up call was in 2010 when a friend of his, Nick Venuto, won the Mount Palomar time trial a couple times, was killed in a freak accident when a car hit him from behind\nPeter had almost taken that same route that day, but decided by simple chance to go another way\nMike was hit by a car once, most mentally scary, 2006, maybe 2007\nWent over the hood, hit his head, and couldn’t move one side of his body, really shook him up\nHe had a hard time getting back on the bike so he bought a CompuTrainer\n\nMike setting the Trans-Iowa (RAGBRAI) record [1:10:15]\n\nThe trek is known as RAGBRAI\nPeter says it’s “the most ridiculous feat in the history of cycling”\nA bucket list thing for Mike growing up in Iowa\nWanted to set speed record across Iowa in 2005\nTo set a record you need a UMCA an official present\nDepending on the route, 270+ miles, more climbing than you think\nWent east to west across Iowa\nNever had to unclip\nFinished in 10 hours 40 minutes\n25.7 mph average\nFelt fantastic at the end, thought about continuing to cross the next state\nLooked at his Polar HR monitor when he finished, couldn’t believe the numbers: 10.5 hours and “it was fun”\nHe didn’t have a power meter, but Peter estimates Mike was doing 310-320 watts on avg.\nPeter says this in line with the professionals, estimating Mike’s FTP (Functional Threshold Power) to be 380-400\nPros look at the metric of watts per kilo",

What led him to eventually pull back?

Do you get bored? \n\n“No, it’s very meditative for me”\nA time to think and work through stuff past and present\nMike describes long distance running as his happy place, the only time he feels normal\nPeter asks, what felt abnormal when you weren’t running?\nThe biggest thing, he just never was that social person, liked to build stuff, challenge himself, didn’t fit into the NY scene, preferred to just push himself\n\nPeople ask, is it worth the sacrifice? \n\nMike calls it a privilege, “if it was a sacrifice, I wouldn’t do it”\n“I don’t choose a path of accepting that I have certain limitations and certain things aren’t possible, I think that’s bullshit”\nMost of the time, they’re wrong\nMike says he was “really good at saying no” back then, “If it wasn’t on the critical path, I wouldn’t do it”\nFor months at a time, he would cut off communication with family so he could focus\n\nPeter asks, what lead to the transition from that to your priorities now?\n\nThe new priority order is family, company, then training\nMike got married and found that during long training sessions he was asking himself, “What am I doing out here?”",
