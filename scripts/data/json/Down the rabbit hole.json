No one was ever charged, but an amateur investigator thinks he knows who set it.”\nI found this story very interesting and for some reason could not stop reading it. Perhaps it was the fascination with ‘who done it,’ but I was also intrigued by the Phud program, in general. Talk about an interesting social experiment. I wonder if any other universities tried something like this?\nMore than anything, it just reminded me of a Nerd Safari.\nSomething else I read this month pertains to my obsession with stressing the importance of slow wave sleep (SWS) in our patients…and we’re constantly looking for ways to improve it. Here’s some evidence that the efforts (such as blue light reduction before bed: I use a pair of computer glasses from Gunnars) are worth it. (Bonus points for anyone who remembers this commercial.)",
