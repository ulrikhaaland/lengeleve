    "content": "In this episode, Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D., discusses the widespread impact of stress on our physical and emotional health as well as the mechanisms by which it can precipitate chronic illness, dementia, depression, and more. He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. \nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#51 - Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D.: The pervasive effect of stress - is it killing you?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#51 - Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D.: The pervasive effect of stress - is it killing you?\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#51 - Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D.: The pervasive effect of stress - is it killing you?\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nBackground, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [7:00];\nPhysiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [14:00];\nIndividual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [24:00];\nHow social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [30:15];\nWhat’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

Robert with a baboon from the troop he studied for decades. Image credit: stanford.edu\nCredentials\n\nRockefeller University for PhD\nPostdoc at Salk Institute in San Diego\nBeen working at Stanford for 31 years\nWrote Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers in 1994\n\nPhysiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [14:00]\nStress causes changes in hormones in our body, the 2 most importantly include:\n\nAdrenaline  ⇒ “It’s on the scene in your bloodstream within one, two seconds after all hell breaks loose.”\nGlucocorticoids (human version called cortisol) ⇒ comes out of the adrenal glands, stressful situation causes hypothalamus to secrete CRH which goes to your pituitary to release ACTH which goes to your adrenals when kicks out cortisol\n\nSympathetic vs. parasympathetic system\n\nThese two systems are autonomic (aka not under your conscious control) \nSympathetic ⇒ fight or flight, all hell breaking loose, alarms going off\nParasympathetic ⇒ calm, vegetative function, stress turns OFF parasympathetic\n\nAdrenaline vs. cortisol\nThey work hand in hand, they synergize\n\nMetaphor: “Adrenaline in two seconds is handing guns out of the gun locker into whoever’s gonna defend you. Glucocorticoids are building the aircraft carriers that a year from now are gonna be essential. It does some of the slower components in the stress response, stretching out over minutes to hours.”\n\nIs one of these 2 systems more primitive that the other?\n\nAdrenaline (i.e. epinephrine and norepinephrine) is technically more primitive\nHowever, glucocorticoids/cortisol are also part of our ancient wiring\n\n“It’s system that’s been serving vertebrates, doing a lot of help for them for an awful long time and it’s been very recent modification to instead secrete them in response to thinking about taxes.”\n\n\n\nWhat is it that cortisol was doing 10,000 years ago that was serving our interests?\n⇒ In the case of life or death (i.e. running from a predator)\n\nAdrenaline comes in immediately and triggers fight or flight for those initial few seconds\nBut 30 seconds later (or minutes later), then glucocorticoids come in\nThey increase vigilant thinking (in terms of smart evasion of the predator)\nThe are bolstering the same process that epinephrine is boosting:\n\nIncreasing glucose levels in your bloodstream\nGoing to storage sites throughout your body (liver, muscle) and breaking stuff down\n\n\nAdditionally, glucocorticoids shut down everything that’s not essential to surviving the next five minutes of this massive physical challenge\n\nDigestion is impaired\nGrowth hormones are turned off \nReproduction is shut off\n\n\n\nDiseases where people are unable to turn on their endocrine stress response:\n\nAddison’s disease (JFK has Addison’s disease)\nShy-Drager syndrome\n“These are diseases where somebody goes running after their commuter bus and they drop dead from hypoglycemic shock.”\n\nIndividual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [24:00]\nSmall window of tolerance\n\nToo much cortisol, it will kill you eventually and make you miserable as hell on the way",

    "content": "\nToo little of it will kill you quite quickly\nWe don’t hate stress, we hate the wrong amount of stress\nWhen it’s the optimal amount, we call it stimulation (roller coasters, scary movies)\n\nIndividual variation \n\nSome people find bird watching super stimulating\nOthers need to be a mercenary in Yemen because that’s when they feel alive and awake\nSo not only is it a narrow range, but we differ so much as to what each person’s optimum amount\n\nHormone receptors\nCan people also have different levels of physiologic benefit or harm at the same level of cortisol?\n\nRobert says “yes”\nPeter is surprised: “That’s not intuitive to me.”\nIn many ways, the level of receptors of the hormones, rather than the level of hormone itself, are more consequential\n\n“Individual differences in levels of receptors, what version you have, how well that works, how avidly it holds onto the hormone, what it is then coupled with afterward downstream inside the cell, that whole world turns out to be as central to understanding individual differences as part of the levels of hormones themselves, and as sensitive to all those things ranging from genes to prenatal environment to early development to psychological factors and so on.”\n\nPeter relates it to insulin: “You could have two people with the exact same level of insulin, completely different physiologic response because of insulin sensitivity.” (i.e. cortisol sensitive/resistant)\nRobert: It’s not only “how loudly you speak hormone, but how effectively your cells list to hormone.”\n\nHow social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [30:15]\nWhen did our species start seeing levels of stress that were unhealthy?\n\nRobert thinks it predates our species\nIt is a feature of smart social mammals (primates, cetaceans, elephants, etc.)\n\nStudying baboons\n\nBaboons in the Serengeti in East Africa have a great life and a fantastic ecosystem\nThey have no natural predators trying to kill them\nTheir infant mortality rate is actually better than the neighboring human tribe (Maasai people)\nThey can find their day’s calories in just 3 hours\nThat leaves the rest of the day to “free time” which often times leads to stressful social interactions with other baboons\n“They are well-off enough in our Westernized sense that they can sit around and generate psychological stress for each other.”\n\nSocial rank and status in baboons\n\nIn baboons, the higher rank in your troop, you have lower levels of glucocorticoid, lower blood pressure, etc.\nBut what matters far more, is the contextual meaning of your rank (i.e. what the rank means in your particular troop)\n\nThe same exact rank means different things in different sorts of baboon cultures\nOne troop may have more members who display more aggression on you, grooming, food getting stolen from you, etc.\n\n\nIn general, lower status equates to lower health\n\nWhat about in humans?\n\nWe also see a similar correlation to rank status and health\nBut interestingly, we belong to multiple hierarchies at once and we can have very different ranks in them (family, work, sports team, hobby, etc.)\nYou could be the lowest ranking employee at your company but be the deacon of your church, for example\nWe are very good psychologically at deciding at whichever hierarchy were highest in and that’s the one we define ourselves by\n\nThe impact of personality differences on stress levels\n\nIt’s more than just social rank… personality differences make a huge impact\nFor example, take two high ranking baboons: The rival baboon sneezes 100 yards away and one of the high ranking baboons takes that as a sign of aggression and starts getting agitated while the other similar rank baboon just continues about his business, well those baboons will have very different glucocorticoid levels\nSimilarly, the highest ranking baboon can have much higher stress levels than a number 10 or 20 in the troop based on his personality differences\n\nWhat’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations? [39:15]\nThe amygdala\n\nIn a brain scanner, if you flash pictures of neutral faces in front of people, the people who see those neutral faces as threatening (reviewed here) tend to have an amygdala that is: \n\nPhysically larger in size\nHigher metabolic rate \nMore electrophysiological\n\n\n\nWhy is the amygdala referred to as the “reptilian” brain?\n\nThe amygdala is one of the anchors of what’s called the limbic system in the brain (emotional brain)\nMammals have a whole lot more limbic development than fish, for example\nThe limbic system is arousal, fear, anger, lust, love, mother/infant bonding, etc. \nAmygdala is involved in fear, anxiety, and aggression ⇒ “So your amygdala is absolutely central to some of our worst human moments.”\n\nThe brain has ~3 parts\n\nThis brainstem (handles everything we don’t have to think about ever i.e. breathing)\nMidbrain (amygdala is the “mayor”, emotions happening beneath consciousness)\nThe cortex (where we “live” and think our thoughts)\n\n      “As the complexity of the organism evolved, so too did that hierarchy.”\nTop down influence:\n\nHumans can do something that no other species can do which is… we can use our cortex to think about something stressful (the fact that we will die someday), and this will go all the way down and affect our brainstem (heart rate increases, breathing increases)\n\nBottom to top influence:\n\n“What’s far more interesting and underappreciated . . . is how those lower levels can influence what’s going on up above.”\n\n⇒ Example of bottom-to-top influence: Classic study from 1973\n\nA group of heterosexual male volunteers\nGuys walk across a really scary suspended bridge\nThe guys would encounter an attractive female either halfway across the bridge, or when they were safely standing on the other side of the bridge\nThey would then be asked to evaluate the attractiveness of the female\nThey would rate her more attractively in the middle of the bridge (when they’re heart was racing)\nThen do the same experiment but give the males a beta blocker (blocks their heart from racing) and the increase in attractiveness was eliminated \nA great example of the “boring, reptilian regulatory stuff helping influence what you think your emotions are.”\n\n\nFigure 2. A photo of Capilano Suspension Bridge, the site of the famous 1974 study. Image credit: wikipedia.org\nWhat makes the human brain different than all other species? [48:15]\n\nYou can’t differentiate the neuron of a human and the neuron of some other organism (fish) when you look at it at the single cell level\nSame neurotransmitters, same enzymes, same gene regulation (We share 98% of our DNA with a chimp or bonobo)\nWe have the same signal transduction pathways and neurons as you see in a fruit fly (You can take one of their genes or one of our genes and stick it in the other one and it functions just fine)\n\nWhat is the key difference? \n\nFor every neuron that a fruit fly has, we have 100 million ⇒ “With enough quantity, you invent quality.”\nEmergent properties of complex systems … example: \n\nYou take one ant and you put it on a table and nothing that it does makes a huge amount of sense\nYou put 10,000 and they build a colony and complex adaptive stuff emerges\n\n\n\n“We’ve got more ants that are coming together in our heads than does a fruit fly and you get more complex emergent stuff happening.”\nImprinting stress to your kids epigenetically [52:00]\nPeter read something that frightened him: If a mother is under great stress, she could imprint epigenetically into the child and alter many features about them as they would age (i.e. propensity to be depressed) \nDoes Robert believe this to be true?\n\n“Absolutely.”\nJust look at childhood adversity versus childhood security and the very different trajectories\nHuge mechanistic challenge for the field? ⇒  Understanding what is it about being in a scary neighborhood/unstable home versus having a parent read to you in a safe zone\nIn other words, what are the nuts and bolts changes that occurs in the kid that makes the adult “30- fold more likely than the next person” for certain things to happen to them?\n\nEpigenetics\n\nEarly experience, doesn’t change your actual genes/DNA sequence\nBut your early experience can change the regulation of your genes (how easily you turn certain genes on/off in different parts of your body/brain)\n\n⇒ For example, non-genetic (non-Mendelian) transmission of traits:\n\nA fetal rat inside a mother who’s highly stressed\nShe’s secreting a lot of rat glucocorticoids, which get into the circulation through the placenta, into the fetal circulation, into the kid’s brain\nOne of the things that it does is it causes an epigenetic change in the amygdala (a bigger amygdala, more excitable, more prone towards interpreting a neutral situation as a threatening one)\nThat new rat will have elevated levels of glucocorticoids because the world is “full of menace that only you were seeing”\nThat rat gets pregnant and during pregnancy as a result, the new fetus is exposed to elevated glucocorticoid levels (so now the phenotype is being passed generation to generation through parallel expression)\n\n⇒ In humans:\n\nThere is a ripple effect from generation to generation\n“In other words, individual differences are rising not only from experience, but from the multi-generational transmission of some of the consequences of experience, which is just mind boggling that that can work that way.”\n\nThe role of stress on memory and the consequences of hypercortisolemia [57:15]\nHow hypercortisolemia will impact the brain\n\nThe hippocampus (important for memory and learning) is extremely sensitive to glucocorticoids\nWhy? 2 reasons:\n\nOne, to have a feedback loop\nTwo, so the hippocampus remembers stuff for you:\n\nWe can’t remember everything, so our memory processes has to come with a filter deciding what is important to remember\nAnd cortisol (along with epinephrine and norepinephrine) amplifies memory consolidation\n\n\n\n\n\nStress Effects on Neuronal Structure: Hippocampus, Amygdala, and Prefrontal Cortex\n⇒ Impact of stress on memory:\n\nThe optimal amount of glucocorticoids (something that is moderately “stressful” or stimulating), great stuff to your hippocampus:\n\nIt increases blood delivery, glucose, and oxygen\nIt makes the synapses (the connections between neurons) more excitable\nA little bit of arousal/alertness is a good thing for learning and memory\n\n\nToo much stress (i.e. you are stressed 24/7 ever since you were like 10 years old) … now the glucocorticoids are out of the optimal range and they do exactly the opposite to the hippocampus:\n\nThey decrease oxygen and glucose delivery to the hippocampus\nThey make neurons less excitable\nThey disconnect synapses\nthey cause the processes in neurons to shrivel\nthey block the birth of new neurons\n\n\nIf you were stressed out of your mind, memory doesn’t work as well\nAnd if you are exposed to excessive glucocorticoid levels for many years, your hippocampus will age more quickly\n\nThe impact of subjective socioeconomic status and social media on stress levels and health [1:01:45] \n“When you look at the source of variability in health among humans on this planet, socioeconomic differences, differences in absolute levels, differences in degrees of inequality within cultures and within communities are an enormous predictor of health. You want to look at the most medically impacted low ranking primates you could find on earth? Look at poor humans because when humans invented socio economic status and the capacity to be poor, they invented a way to subordinate the have-nots like no chimp on earth could ever dream of doing.”\nPeter’s podcast with Dr. Tom Catena\n\nTom is an amazing physician practicing in the Nuba Mountains (South Sudan) as the only doctor to a million people\nThe Nuba people are being bombed and killed by al-Bashir, an evil dictator\nBut despite their hardships, the Nuba people almost never commit suicide\nTheir life and existence would be considered abysmal to the western countries\nYet Peter would think their cortisol is lower than ours\n\n⇒ What would Robert hypothesize explains that positive mental health?\n\nProbably a combination of a strong sense of community and little subjective status disparity\nThe quarter poorest places on earth, indeed people don’t live very long and are generally miserable\nBut once you get above the subsistence level, there’s not a great relationship between the wealth of the country (GDP per capita) and levels of happiness or life expectancy\n\nWhat explains the poor health/mental health of westernized countries?\nIn the westernized world, there is a health/socioeconomic gradient ⇒ The poorer you are, the worse your health will be on the average (and when you get a disease, the more impactful it is)\nBut why does this relationship occur?\nHypothesis #1: If you’re not healthy, it’s very hard to pull off being the CEO of a company\n\nIn other words, poor health precedes and gives rise to poor socioeconomic status",

    "content": "\nBut this turns out to explain only a tiny percentage of the variability \nWhat about the other way around?\nWhen a child is raised in a home low on the level of socioeconomic status that is a predictor of their likelihood of diabetes half a century later\nSo, yes, the socioeconomic status comes first in explaining the vast percentage of the variability \n\nHypothesis #2: Maybe everybody is equally healthy, but the really poor people are just really unhealthy (i.e. a step function)\n\nThis is not true, says Robert\nWith every step down starting from the ultra wealthy (i.e. Bill Gates), there is statistically lower health as you go down every rung\n\nHypothesis #3: Lack of healthcare access (neo-materialist explanation)\n\nThe poorer you are, you don’t have healthcare access, you don’t have health insurance, you can’t go to the doctors readily, your carer is more lousy\nThat explains virtually none of the variability in the data because you see the gradient nonetheless in countries with socialized medicine and universal healthcare\nSo, it’s not healthcare access\n\nSubjective status and stress\n\nFrom there, you then look cross culturally and you see wildly different income levels and wildly different levels of healthcare access, yet you see very similar life spans across these countries and very similar gradients\nTurns out, it’s got very little to do with the material aspects of wealth or poverty, it’s got to do with the psychological aspects, it’s got to do with the stress\n\n*First key finding out of UCSF by Nancy Adler*\n\nYour socioeconomic status, your wealth, your objective measure of wealth, is indeed a predictor of your health\nBut it turns out at least as good of a predictor is your subjective socioeconomic status\nWhen you look at people around you, how are you doing compared to other people?\nAsking this way allows for the person to consider the community that’s most pertinent to them (Who’s the comparison group?)\n“It turns out your subjective socioeconomic status is at least as good of a predictor of your health as is your objective socioeconomic status.”\n\n⇒ Example:\n\nOne guy is assistant manager of the mail room ⇒ And to him, that’s an incredibly status filled position in his opinion\nAnd there’s another guy who’s number 2 in the whole company who was just passed over to be number 1 ⇒ And the only pertinent thing in his mind is not the 99,000 employees and he’s higher ranking but that there’s still somebody ahead him \n“In other words, it’s not being poor, it’s feeling poor.”\n\n*The next critical piece is work from Richard Wilkinson in the UK*\n\nHe looked at… what’s the best, most effective way to make somebody feel poor, independent of their absolute levels of income?\n\nSurround them by inequality\nSurround them by reminders of all the people who were doing better than them\n\n\n\nTechnology, social media, and the modern world\n\nSocial media is the amplifier to all amplifiers of this\nYou can’t go 10 minutes without looking at somebody who’s obviously better looking, obviously smarter, obviously richer, obviously having more fun, says Peter\nRobert points out that it could be even as simple as seeing a nice car come speeding past you on the road leading to you feeling crappy and diminished and like a less successful human \nLocal inequality is more impactful, yet technology and social media has allowed for an expansion of the definition of “local”\n\n“This is unheard of in the history of humans or primates of being able to feel socially subordinated and you don’t even interact with the person.”\nSocial media as an amplifier\n\nNo matter what century you grew up in, it is possible to experience the corrosive effects of being the last one picked for the game, the least popular kid, etc. \nBut in today’s environment, you can spend 24/7 wallowing toxically in evidence of a gazillion other people who are better looking than you, more popular, etc.\nSocial media and technology makes the vulnerable more damaged than in the past\n\nTips for managing stress in the modern world  [1:17:45]\nOf all the things that portend good health (nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress), Peter says he’s most worried about stress (it drives him crazy, he says)\nExample:\n\nPeter says his highest blood glucose (besides immediately follow a meal) is always in the morning (according to his CGM that he wears 24/7)\nOnce after not eating in over 24 hours, he had a glucose of 110 milligrams per deciliter when he woke up\nWith CGM, Peter says you get this insight into this “horrible thing that’s happening when we think we’re sleeping and nothing else is going on, but we’re ruminating”\n\nIs it the “dawn effect?”\n\nThis could be explained by the “dawn effect”, which is basically your body’s release of cortisol to help you wake up and get your body started\nPeter says it just seems like it’s disproportionate, it must be more than that:\ne.g. People with type 2 diabetes have an amplified “dawn effect” ⇒ Why is that someone who already has glucose dysregulation would have an even higher cortisol response in the morning?\n\nPeter’s point:\n\nThis seems like this a harder problem to fix\nWe don’t have a pill to fix hypercortisolemia\nIt’s one of the most complicated endocrine situations that also happens to be innately wired into us\n\nWhat should someone be doing to combat this?\n\nRobert says he also struggles with this ⇒ “I’m mostly good at telling you what’s going to happen if you don’t get stuff under control rather than how to get things under control.”\nWhat do you see when you look at the literature closely? \n\nFirst off, you must practice regularly with set aside time (i.e. you can’t do your stress management on the weekends, or for the 30 seconds your on hold on the phone)\nIn other words, like exercise you need hours per week of time set aside\nSame with nutritional interventions as well as putting a premium on sleep\n\n\nIf you want to combat hypercortisolemia … “It ain’t a 20 minute a week thing.”\n80/20 rule: Robert says simply deciding that you are going to start doing something to manage your distress gets you 80% of the way there\n\nWhy daily is better than weekly:\n\nRobert says that 10 minutes of deliberate mindful practice of meditation daily would be better than one hour once a week\nIf you do it daily, you are sitting in the aftermath of having done that versus only one time a week (the recovery period)\nIn the same way, one awful hour long stressor a week versus punctuated episodes of it throughout the week … without question, the latter is worse because you’ve now got umpteen different times that you have to recover from having turned on the stress response and that’s where a lot of the damage occurs (in the recovery period)\n\nEmail is a stress trigger for Peter\n\nHe was getting agitated seeing his fluctuations in glucose each time he looked at his email\nResting heart rate would be higher in the morning even after regular exercise that should improve his resting HR\nHe changed to only looking at email for two 30-minute blocks per day and it really helped\n“We just have to figure out ways to figure out what those triggers are for us individually”\n\nWhat Robert learned about himself studying the social behavior of baboons [1:29:30]\n\nRobert is a very driven, accomplished person (which comes with stress)\nHe won the MacArthur award in 1987 for his work as a neuroendocrinologist and primatologist\n\nWhat did Robert learn about himself over the past 30 years going back his days in Kenya?\n\nAs a field biologist, Robert was spending 3-4 months per year living alone in a tent without speaking to another human for 12 hours per day\nHe was studying the benefits of social behavior of baboons\nHe started to realize the irony of the situation\n\nMeeting his wife\n\nEventually he met his now wife and they started a family\nHe now calls his family a “refuge and a sanctuary from the world’s madness”\nHe says, 20 years ago “I could not have predicted sort of how much of my equilibrium at this point turns out to be due to interacting with the right two or three other primates”\n\nThe multilayered factors behind every human behavior, the context of “good and bad”, and exploring the human capacity of the wild extremes of violence and altruism from moment to moment [1:34:30]\nRobert’s book: Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst\n\nThe book was about trying to make sense of the biology of a puzzling thing about us as a behaving species, which is we are simultaneously the most miserably violent species on earth and the most altruistic and cooperative and empathic\nAny given human is capable of incredible gyrations in wonderful and awful behavior (and everything in between)\n\nThe context of the behavior\n\nAnd whether the behavior counts as good or bad is incredibly dependent on what culture they happen to be doing it in\nPulling a trigger: Sometimes pulling a trigger can be one of the most awful things a human can do… and sometimes it could be one of the most wondrous ones if you’re suicidally drawing fire from innocent people and you’re sacrificing yourself\nLovingly touching someone: In one setting you put your hand on somebody else’s and that could be a moment of incredible compassion… or you do the exact same thing with your primate muscles and that’s the first step of betraying a loved one \n\nMultilayered factors of every behavior\n⇒ To make sense of human behavior you got to factor in:\n\nWhat your neurons did one second ago (as well as the environmental triggers that caused that 30 seconds ago)\nHormone levels were like this morning\nNeuroplasticity you’ve done over the last two seasons\nWhat your adolescence was like, your childhood, even your fetal life\nYour genes\nWhat sort of culture were your ancestors inventing centuries ago because that influenced the way you were raised within minutes of birth\nWhat things you value\nWhat things your amygdala does, or does not, respond to\nAnd finally evolution (i.e. why we’re in some ways like chimps and in some ways like bonobos, but we’re not either of those) \n\n*To understand this stuff, you’ve got to consider everything from one second before to a hundred million years before, and how all of these levels interact*\n“What’s most startling about us is most of us have the capacity to do something that we would be stunned and sickened that we were capable of doing it. And most of us are capable of in some circumstance of doing something that is so damn heroic. And most of us spending most of our time doing things that instead are ambiguous and multilayered and full of ulterior motives. And you look at the worst of us and the best of us and there’s not a whole lot of really reliable predictors beforehand.”\nPMS: How two women with identical hormone levels can have completely different emotional experiences [1:39:00]\n\nPeter sees PMS purely through the len of the endocrine system (estrogen and progesterone levels fluctuating)\nWhat’s fascinating is that 2 women could have the exact same peak and valley in hormones yet report totally different experiences\nPeter says it could have something to do with “progesterone receptors” \n\nDoes Robert have any additional insight into this?\nRobert wife observed this in baboons…\n\nTwo baboons having the same menstrual cycle\nOne of them is a totally irritable, awful jerk to all the other females around her for three days afterward\nThe other baboon instead withdraws and become socially isolated\nWhat’s the difference?\n\nOne of them is high ranking ⇒ She could afford to be a jerk to everybody else and get away with it… the other baboon was low ranking\nSo it’s not just your hormone levels, it’s what sort of position in your society you have\n\n\nFor example, women in collectivist cultures react differently on average to people in individualistic cultures ⇒ Are you in a culture where it’s culturally acceptable to bitch and moan to all your best friends when you’re not feeling well or are you in a culture where when you’re feeling lousy, what you’re supposed to do is reach out affiliative-ly and reify your like social values?\n\nHow much of a role do genes play in depression and other emotional states? [1:42:45]\nRobert’s high-level perspective on the role of genes\n\nIn the school of genes get overrated in terms of their impact\nWhen you get to genetic influences on behavior and our internal lives, genes are important, but overwhelmingly these are genes that modify vulnerability to certain environments\n\nGenes implicated in depression\n\nThe single most important gene is the serotonin transporter (targeted with SSRI/Prozac)\nThe gene comes in a few different variants, one of which appears to make you more at risk for major depression\n\nClassic study by Avshalom Caspi\n\n17,000 people followed from birth to age 25\nAbout 20% of the study population has the “bad” variant of the gene",

    "content": "\nWhat they saw is that there was no increase in risk having the bad variant\nHowever, if coupled with a lot of childhood stress, there was about a 20x increase\nThe same childhood stressors to people without the “bad” gene variant had only a moderate increase in depression incidence\nIt turns out these different gene variants are regulated in different ways by glucocorticoids (so stress has an impact)\n\nStudy looking at genetics of aggression\n\nThe gene is monoamine oxidase and it comes in several variants\nSame study population as the depression study\nJust having that variant doesn’t get you a higher risk of antisocial, violent behavior by age 25 unless it was coupled with childhood abuse growing up\n\n“These are all genes about vulnerability and potentialities, and tendencies that are emerging only in certain environments and not in others. They’re the factors that are inseparable.”\nWhy is cortisol elevated under sleep deprivation? [1:50:15]\n\nWhen we are sleep deprived, our cortisol levels are elevated\nPeter says, this is counterintuitive\nPeter’s possible explanation: if you’re sleep deprived, you’re body is assuming there is a good reason for it so you want cortisol to keep you awake and alert\n\n⇒ Robert’s take: If you’re a basic mammal and you are wide awake when you’re supposed to be asleep… this does not happen by chance… the odds are you have something stressful going on\nThe subtle interplay of sleep, sleep quality, and cortisol\nWhat we know now… \n\nCircadian peak of glucocorticoids are around the time you wake up\nAn hour before you wake up, levels begin to rise, not for dealing with a stressor that has already commenced, but in preparation for having to get up and function\n\nInteresting sleep study:\n\nTake a group of volunteers\nThe first night, tell them that this night we’re going to wake you up at 4 AM\n\nThe result? ⇒ Around 3 AM their glucocorticoid levels start rising\n\n\nThen, the next night you tell them I’m going to wake you up at some point during the night and that’s the end of your night’s sleep\n\nResult? ⇒ After 90 minutes (one sleep cycle), their cortisol rises and stays high for the rest of the night\n\n\nSo, not only is it bad not to get enough sleep, and not only is it bad if that insufficient sleep is fragmented, but the worst is if it’s fragmented unpredictably\n\n“And that’s like every medical resident in history.”\nIn med school, Peter will literally tape a pager to his forehead because he was worried about sleeping through the call\n“It’s wildly destructive.”\nIt turns out if you have elevated glucocorticoid levels while you’re asleep:\n\nYou have less delta sleep time (restorative sleep)\nYou make less adenosine stores in your brain\nThe sleep quality is going to be horrible\n\nThe impact of stress on cancer [1:54:30]\n\nThere’s a common perception that stress can play a very substantial role in the onset of cancer, in coming out of remission, and rates of tumor growth\nHowever, the actual evidence is very, very minimal, says Robert\nMost human studies have too many confounding factors\n\nWhen you look at the animal studies…\n\nTypically, you experimentally induce a tumor\nUnder those circumstances, you can accelerate the growth of the tumor by increasing stress, but those are circumstances of cancer acquisition that are virtually irrelevant to human cancer\nAnd when you induce a cancer and induce a lot of stress you likely will alter some other parameter (What it eats, how much it’s sleeps, the quality of its sleep) \n“So it becomes difficult to disentangle cortisol.”\n\nWhat about injecting glucocorticoid to a rat that already has cancer? In other words, you don’t actually increase the stress level, you just increase the readout state of stress?\n\n“You accelerate the tumor growth.”\nA cancer cell will upregulate the GLUT4 glucose transporter (which is further upregulated by glucocorticoids) so it’s just “shoveling energy over those cells”\nPeter says this strikes him as reasonable evidence that cortisol can play a role in cancer\nRobert walks back this assumption: “Yes, but again, these are types of cancers where this was virally induced transformation of cells that are then transplanted in very artificial systems that turned out not to be terribly applicable to human cancers.”\n\nAre glucocorticoids immunosuppressive?\n\nYes, they be potently immunosuppressive\nBut, usually by the time you have a tumor growing, that’s long past the point where it’s an immunological problem\nThe focus shifts to how to keep the tumor from growing a whole bunch of capillaries, from stealing all sorts of energy, turning off cell death programs…  “It’s no longer in the immune realm.”\n\nThe takeaway about stress and cancer:\n\nHard to make the case that acute bouts of stress can really have any impact on cancer development\nEasier to make the case that an acute disruption the immune system might lead to getting a cold\nA message from Robert:\n\nThe massive take home message is not to blame your stress for your cancer and think it’s all your fault\nAnd anyone who is selling a “stress management will stop your tumor”, or make it “disappear” entirely, watch your wallet\n\n\n\nWhat is something that has been shown to increase effectiveness of cancer therapy?\n⇒ Work out of Stanford from David Spiegel\n\nShowed that things like supportive group therapy among cancer patients enhances survival\nWhat is the mechanism of that?\nOne might think it reduced stress and therefore the decrease in cortisol lead to a positive cascade\nHowever, turns out that people in supportive cancer therapy with other people going through the same hell, they become more compliant with their medical regimes\n“When you’re surrounded by people who are going through the same thing and understand, you’re more likely to be compliant. I think that winds up explaining an awful lot of that effect.”\n\nThe impact of stress on atherosclerosis, dementia, addiction, and depression [2:01:15]\nAtherosclerosis\n“The damage of hypercortisolemia and the accelerated stress response are probably most demonstrated in cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis.”\nThe damage of hypercortisolemia: Hypertension, both macro and micro vasculature, endothelial disruption, adhesion of cells\nDementia\n\nI would expect that it’s playing a role in dementia, says Peter\nPerhaps not in isolation but in combination with other factors\n\n⇒ For example, \n\nCortisol inhibits melatonin secretion\nSomeone with hypercortisolemia generally has higher than normal cortisol during sleep which means their melatonin levels will be suppressed\nMelatonin is a a pro-neurogenic molecule, so having less of that is less restorative to the brain\n\nWhat other lines of evidence do you see that stress can damage the brain?\nHippocampus\n\nBasically everything we talked about with the hippocampus applies in the adult brain as well\nWe first see changes to the hippocampus in terms of damaging memory capacity\nStress and lots of glucocorticoids can accelerate hippocampal aging (neuron loss, memory problems, and the extent of reactive gliosis)\n\nAmygdala\n\nIs there a direct correlation between amygdala size and dementia?\nYou generally see expansion of the amygdala and you see atrophy of the hippocampus (especially in PTSD)\nGlucocorticoids probably play the driving role in both\n\nIn the hippocampus: \n\nStress and glucocorticoids cause:\nNeurons to not work as well\nNeural networks don’t work as well\nThe overall size decreases\n\nIn the amygdala:\n\nIt’s the exact opposite story… \nNeurons work better than they should\nNeurons become more excitable\nForm denser networks\nAnd the amygdala gets bigger in size\n\nWhat are the implications of this?\n\nIn the hippocampus: Your memory goes down the tubes\nIn the amygdala: It leads to anxiety disorders and fear\n\nDopamine, depression and addiction\n\nDopamine is the neurotransmitter most famously associated with reward pleasure\nBut a much more accurate, subtle picture is that dopamine is actually more about the anticipation of pleasure than it is about pleasure itself (goal directed behavior, i.e. what you’re willing to do in anticipation of reward)\nStress and glucocorticoids mess with the dopamine system\n\nA messed up dopamine system predisposes us towards the two big psychiatric diseases:\n\n1) Addiction\n\nMore vulnerability to addiction\nHarder to get off of addictive substances\n\n\n2) Depression\n\nDepression is a disease of on a certain level, dopamine depletion. \nDepression is a disease of inability to feel pleasure and hedonia\n\n\n\nThat’s neurochemistry of the link between chronic stress and why that increases the likelihood of the first three, four episodes of major depression\nImpulsiveness, impaired judgement, and lack of empathy in times of stress [2:05:45]\nThe frontal cortex\nImpulse control and judgement\n\nRobert says what’s most interesting to him is what stress and glucocorticoids do to the frontal cortex\nStress will impact judgment, impulse control, executive function, long term planning, strategizing, to name a few \nDuring moments of extreme emotional arousal (especially aversive ones) we make terrible, terrible decisions that seem brilliant at the time\nIn those extreme moments, your amygdala overpowers your frontal cortex\n\nLack of empathy\n\nWhen we’re very stressed, it’s hard for the frontal cortex to do one of it’s harder jobs which is to take the view of the world from somebody else’s perspective\nIn both rats and humans, when you are stressed, you are less empathic towards strangers when they’re in pain\nBut if you block glucocorticoid release, you don’t get that effect anymore\nGlucocorticoids narrow the window as to who counts as an “us” \n\n“The fact that stress makes people crappier to each other, and less empathic, and more parochial, and more xenophobic, and more impulsive with the worst of our impulses. That’s the stuff that really interests me these days.”\nCriminal justice system\n\nBoth Peter and Robert agree that these findings have big implications in the world criminal justice reform\nA lot of these things that people have wound up in prison for are really impulsive, horrible decisions, as opposed to decades of sinister planning\nAnd it’s not clear that the environment in there is reducing cortisol levels to the level that would enable rehabilitation\n“It really strikes me as the exception and not the rule that people are able to emerge from that environment and go on to be successful outside.”\n\nFor more on this topic, check out an episode of The Drive with a reformed prisoner named Corey McCarthy\nWhat advice would Robert give his 25-year-old self? [2:12:45]\nHow has Robert managed to have such a successful career to this point?\n“Just damn luck. Every bit of neurosis, every bit of affective instability that I’ve got, every childhood trauma I’ve got tucked away, I’ve titrated in just the right way and I’ve turned it into more productivity. \nMy capacity to sublimate emotion into intellectual pursuits, into really, really, really wanting to understand something. . .I’ve gotten just the right levels of all sorts of tumult, that have synergized most productively. In other words, just huge amounts of luck.”\nThe cost of ambition:\nRobert says there is a cost associated with each ambition, and as he ages he starts to more carefully analyze those costs to make better decisions\nWhat advice would you give the 25 year-old Robert as he was just finishing that PHD at Rockefeller?\n“Be less ambitious.”\n",
