There was no difference between the two arms. \n“That was a big hit in an industry where it was pretty much the Wild West at that point in terms of the number of stents people were getting.”\n“This definitely was a big result in cardiology, particularly in interventional cardiology. It was not met without criticism, as you can imagine.”\n\nORBITA trial\n\nQuestion: Are stents actually even reducing symptoms?\n*The key differentiator of this trial was blinded, which meant there were sham procedures done\nThe setup: People with a known blockage were randomly assigned to get either optimized medical therapy or stent. But it was blinded so everyone got a catheter put in but wouldn’t know whether or not a stent was inserted.\nCriticisms: It was a small sample size\n\n⇒ Peter’s quick rant about power and significance: \n“From a size perspective, the issue comes down to power. I think this is the biggest challenge of trial design. People talk a lot about significance, which is what the P value tells you, but people don’t talk a lot about power, which is beta. The idea here is, you have to have some sense, a priori, of how much of a difference you will see to design your trial because you have to know how many people to put in it. Because if the trial comes out and there is a statistically-significant difference, which is usually defined the P value less than 0.05, meaning there is a less than 5% chance that the difference you have observed is due to chance, then power becomes irrelevant. It’s just that power becomes so important when the opposite happens, when you don’t see a difference.\nIt’s your ability to say, ‘We don’t see a difference, and we believe that a difference is not there,’ versus, ‘We don’t see a difference, but we didn’t have enough people to look at it.’ For example, if I was gonna design a trial with me and Ethan, just as the two of us, it’s quite likely that I would never find a statistically-significant distinction. But that doesn’t mean that the metric I’m looking at doesn’t exist, it’s just with two people in a trial the probability that I’m going to find it is incredibly low unless the difference is egregious. I’ve always found this to be the biggest challenge of clinical trials is that you have to have some sense of your expected outcome to select beta to power the study appropriately.”\n\nResult of the study: They did not see a difference in symptom (i.e. it didn’t help, on average)\nHow is was presented to the public (i.e. NY TImes and Wall Street Journal): Stents not only do they not reduce your risk of having a heart attack or die, they don’t even reduce your symptoms.\n“It created a firestorm of conversation.”\nTiming of this report: This was during the day that doctors would do stress testing and as soon as they would see a 70% blockage they would put in a stent (George W. Bush has a stent for stable angina around this time)\nTakeaway from the trial (Ethan’s perspective): While stents may or may not be useful in some circumstances at reducing your symptoms, it’s very unlikely that, in stable angina, they’re gonna do anything else (such as change mortality risk). But either way, it’s our job to try to manage you as best we can with medicines before we go down that path, because there are going to be consequences that putting a stent in you. If medications are working, or making your feel miserable, we’re gonna keep that stenting procedure in our back pocket.\n\nThe changing nature of scientific knowledge [1:29:30]\n\nAn unfortunate nature of science is that what is “known” today could be different tomorrow\n“All facts have a half-life”, says Peter\nWhile it may be frustrating, Peter says it is “in some ways, that’s the single most exciting thing about science. It would be boring if all of the natural universe and its laws were known and this was just a game of memorizing all those facts.\nSometimes results are just “wrong”, says Ethan: “Even a P-value of 0.05 means … there’s a 5% chance that the result happened by chance.\n",

Is it actually maintained? \nSo are you basically trying to mobilize fat as a way of avoiding starvation? \nIs it basically you’re trying to direct GH to act only on the periphery and not on the liver?\n\nWhat about fasting is improving longevity?\n\nBy the way, if you believe that periodic fasting improves longevity (Valter Longo does), it also begs the question, is the benefit conferred by the reduction in IGF or the transient rise in GH?\n“I never even really considered that the benefit could be conferred from the GH rise, although that seems less likely… who knows though… if biology teaches us anything it’s to stop acting like we know what we’re talking about.”\n\nThe importance of becoming scientifically literate and making science more exciting for future generations [2:38:30]\n“An inability to understand science makes you a victim for the rest of your life.” —Peter Attia on his concerns about the “retreat” from science in early education\n\nPeter’s big concern with early education is the “retreat from science” (especially in the case of females)\nIt’s not that he wants everyone to become a scientist, but that an inability to understand science can result in you being overrun with propaganda and nonsense\nConcerning fact about the makeup of the Senate: less than 1% of the lawmakers of this country are trained scientifically\n\nEthan’s take:\n⇒ First… he Believes scientists need to do a better job of “communicating what we do in an interesting and exciting way to people without dumbing it down” (he commends Peter for The Drive as a great example of that)\n\nEthan highly recommends videos from iBiology.org started by Ron Vale\nEthan recently appeared on one with David Sabatini in a series about mTOR\n\n⇒ Secondly, there’s a trend of becoming hyper specialized earlier and earlier in life\n\nThe problem with this is that…\n\n1) People who get into science at a young age get burned out and don’t like it by the time they get to be a fellow or a resident or attending\n2) People who don’t get into science until later such as mid-college (like Ethan) find it way too much of an obstacle to get in now in 2019 (compared to 1991)\n\n\n\nProject to help MD students learn science:\n\nEthan is working on something (it’s early so he can’t say much yet)\nWorking on ways to help MD only medical students and beyond get exposed to real intensive multi-year experiences in the lab\nIt will help increase the scientific literacy so MDs will be able to speak both these languages (traditional MD training has almost no scientific training)\n\nEthan’s new company: Keyto [2:43:45]\nKeyto\n\nEthan started a company called Keyto which created a portable breath analyzer for acetone\nEthan believes that behavioral science is the most interesting part of the obesity story\nSo this sensor is ultimately all about solving the question: How do we use technology to help people change their behavior?\n\nLack of good tools and information\n\nMost people use the body weight scale to track their weight loss\nBut the scale is an incredibly lagging indicator (you could have entire gallon of ice cream tonight at 11 PM and step on the scale tomorrow and you may not have any difference in your weight)\nSo it’s relatively useless on a day to day level, and by the time you actually get information it’s not actionable\nPeter also points out that water weight (especially in women still experiencing a menstrual cycle) can fluctuate wildly in a single day\n\nThe ketogenic diet for weight loss\n\nThe one unique fact about the keto diet that’s different from all the other diets is it allows you to follow a biomarker which acts as a guide to help your own adherence and help reinforce some of these behaviors\nCurrent ways of testing your ketone level (blood or breath or urine) has all kinds of issues and imperfection\nBut a good sensor (like Keyto) that people could carry around with them, and be accurate enough, could actually help guide behavioral changes\n\n\nFigure 10.
