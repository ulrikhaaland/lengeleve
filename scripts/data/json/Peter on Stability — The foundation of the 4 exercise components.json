And it’s the way that you do so safely.”\nStability is…\n\na way that we transmit force from the body to the outside world…\nin the safest manner possible…\nacross the muscles which are designed to carry that load…\nas opposed to seeing the dissipation of force across joints that are not fit to do so.\n\n–For example, when you pick up 60 pounds off the ground\n\nNewton’s Law says you have to exert 60 pounds of force on the world around you to move that thing\nThe idea is you want all of that 60 pounds to be transmitted from your muscles to the ground\nAnd you DON’T want anything dissipating out your back, knees, or hips\n\n-Humans are born with this ability\n\nBut we lose it over time because of our lack of activity and our abundance of sitting\nBut it’s possible to reacquire this ability through deliberate practice of these movements\n\n\nFigure 1.
