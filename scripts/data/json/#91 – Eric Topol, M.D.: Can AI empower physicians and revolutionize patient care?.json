That kept me busy. I always need a kind of big project, something that’s a reach, to keep me going. And so that was important that it actually was a four-year run on top of the other things I was doing to get that new medical school off the ground.” – Eric Topol, M.D.\n \nHow Eric helped to elucidate the issues with Vioxx (and why he came to regret it) [30:00]\nWhat is Vioxx?\n\nA COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) related to the nonselective NSAIDs , such as ibuprofen and naproxen\n\nThe marketed promise\n\nInstead of  Advil and Aleve and other nonsteroidals that it would replace, Vioxx would spare the stomach and would be a more potent pain reliever and anti-inflammatories\n\nThe controversy\n\nTopol and his colleagues published in 2001 was a meta-analysis of the 2000 Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research Study (VIGOR), the 2000 Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS), and 2 small trials with around 1000 subjects each\nThe VIGOR trial tested rofecoxib against another NSAID, naproxen, and found that, while the two groups had similar rates of CV-related deaths and overall mortality, Vioxx had a higher mortality rate\nMerck attributed the comparatively high heart attack rates to an unproven protective effect of naproxen\nMerck tried to intimidate Topol in order to get the paper withdrawn\n",

    "content": "\n“There was no data to support that, and it seemed like a very odd explanation for this excess of heart attack. We went over the data, and I said, ‘You know what, we’ve got to publish this because this is really important.’ And so we put together a paper and went to JAMA. It was published.” – Eric Topol, M.D.\n\nEric appeared on 60 minutes and was outspoken to other publications like the Wall Street Journal\n\nPopulation comorbidity complications \n\nThere were other small studies, withheld by Merck, that showed excess heart attacks in those taking Vioxx\nOne in 50 absolute risk for hard mortality outcome\nAt the time, it was not clear who was at risk, but 80 million people took Vioxx\nMost people that have severe osteoarthritis are also having comorbidities that would put them at risk for heart attack (a ubiquitous disease)\n\n“You can’t single it out. It’s almost impossible. If you had assays to show the selectivity of the COX-2 inhibitor was prothrombotic, making a clot in a person, and that person then had a heart attack or stroke. But who had that? These were sudden events, and no one had a proof in that person that their clotting status changed from the drugs” – Eric Topol, M.D.\nWhy Eric has come to regret publishing the paper about Vioxx and how Merck avoided any big ramifications from their error:\n–Merck never really fessed up to the error and never had to pay out any money in lawsuits\n\n“Nowadays, everybody talks about truths and fake and whatnot. But to me, then was the beginning of seeing that syndrome because here was truth, and it was just being basically turned into fake news by Merck, and they had gone years of marketing a drug, mass marketing a drug. You could not [have] turn on a TV set without seeing ads for Vioxx. And they never fessed up … Every single patient case that went to court, they basically prevailed eventually, whether it was the original case or the appeals, by this whole inability for proof in an individual patient. So they didn’t pay anything.”\n\n-Eric says he regrets publishing the paper calling out Vioxx as Merck didn’t do anything (in terms of withdrawing the drug in direct response) \n\n“I don’t know that our paper, even though it was the first one and was in a high profile journal, I think they still would have had a hard time keeping that drug. Well, they might have … put on a warning and keep marketing [it], which is what they should have done. It was a good drug. But the problem was that the doses that they were recommending, certain people were getting exposed. And you say: Well, two out of a hundred is not a lot, but when you have tens of millions of people, it’s a lot.”\n\n-Eric recalls that it was a horrible time in his career\n\nHe received actually threats from people associated with Merck\nAnd some people at the Cleveland Clinic, where Eric was working, were turning against him\n\n“The chairman of the board of the Cleveland Clinic [Malachi Mixon]  and the CEO of Merck [Raymond Gilmartin] were basically ganging up to suppress me and gag me and also to turn on me. So I had my own institution, I had Merck against me. It was a nightmare, I mean a veritable nightmare.”\n\n\n\n \nHow Eric came to found one of the most influential research centers in the world [47:45]\n“It was almost the end of my career. That’s what precipitated leaving Cleveland and fortunately coming to San Diego, which was the greatest thing ever, but who would have known? For a year or two, it was a question of whether it would be a new position and whether it would be suited to things that I would want to do” – Eric Topol, M.D.\nEric joins Scripps Research and forms Scripps Translational Research Institute\n\nEric was recruited at Scripps Research in 2006 during which time Scripps Health was a separate entity \nEric came in as a  cardiologist at Scripps Clinic, but also to develop a new institute that was dedicated to translational research, particularly genomics\nRealized sequencing could be aided by wireless and digital technologies instead of just genome sequencing \nHe came to Scripps to try to make human genomics and genetics center stage for the two Scripps Institutions.\nAnd he wanted to translate advancements as quickly as possible to patient care \nEric secured NIH grants for innovations in medicine\n\n“When I got here [Scripps], it was like being in the witness protection program, and you’re starting all over. I remember I had this big lab where we’re going to do all the sequencing, and I’m sitting in this big lab, and I’m the only one in the lab, and I got a lot of recruitment to do … We have one of the largest NIH grants in history … which we’re doing so much with over the years ahead. So things are really humming, so it’s been great” – Eric Topol, M.D.\nAs the editor-in-chief of Medscape\n\nMedscape, part of WebMD (private but for-profit company)\nThe website acquired theheart.org – which Eric started with friends as the first cardiovascular website for cardiologists and anyone else working in the space\nSets the general direction for news coverage, such as a Wall Street Journal article written by former dean of Penn medical school, Stanley Goldfarb, taking on medical education of today\nThe Medscape team also includes the Vice President of Editorial, who is also the co-founder of Retraction Watch, Ivan Oranksy\n\n \nHow AI and deep learning is currently impacting medicine, and the future possibilities [56:45]\nRecognizing AI technology\n“What we’re talking about now is a specific subtype of AI, which got its birth just over 10 years ago, called deep learning, neural networks that allow for inputs. And they could be millions, billions of data points. It could be images, it could be speech, could be text. And then it goes these layers of artificial neurons, which are not very much like neurons. But nonetheless, they can distinguish features progressively as they go through this network. And then you get outputs.\n\nTechnological advancements made in the field have been recognized by the A.M. Turing Award: Geoffrey Hinton and his colleagues received the award for engineering breakthroughs of deep neural network computing\nOngoing studies will demonstrate superiority of image definition accuracy, or as good as through machine  \n\nDeep learning accuracy can work synergistically with human doctors\n\nThe thesis of Deep Medicine, Eric’s book, is that machine learning will free up time with patients that could restore the patient-doctor relationship back to where it was 40 years ago\n\n“… Deep learning is in many respects extraordinary, but it’s very narrow. If I say: ‘Find me pulmonary nodules in a chest X Ray,’ that’s where I say it can be superior. Clearly the best is the combination, the synergy, the symbiosis of what the machine can, quote, see versus what the doctor could see. Yes, it’s a very narrow thing, but what we’re talking about here is there’s so many mistakes in medicine because things are missed or are inaccurate and this extends through pathology and every different specialty” – Eric Topol, M.D.\n\nThe complimentary reading will benefit speed and accuracy, improving medicine and ultimately lower costs \nThere is a lot of promise and potential for AI but it has not [yet] been actualized \nClinical trials in colonoscopy utilize AI to improve the amount of overlooked polyps\nA recent randomized trial utilized deep learning for polyp identification\n\nFurther requirements for AI development\n\nMedical field requires multimodal data collection and integration: varied types of inputs (e.g., vital signs, machine vision of patient facial recognition, different aspects of the patient, history, existing electronic record) \nDeep learning is still applied too narrowly (one modality)\nDevelopment will head towards integrating data points; hybrid models to bring data together \n\nEric on why physicians need more AI support:\n“There’s more data than we can handle. Especially when you say people are wearing sensors, are going to be wearing more, people are going to have their genome sequence or they already have a genome chip or array, a microbiome of the gut. No less all their records, not just the one health care place that they happen to be visiting that moment. This flood of data per person, no less, the intensive data collection in an ICU setting, is over human capability. We need machines. We have to fess up that we can’t do this, but we also have to acknowledge that we’re not there yet” – Eric Topol, M.D.\nDeep learning innovation and the atrial fibrillation case example\nSources of deep learning development\n\nEric believes deep learning innovation will come from outside of big pharma\nGoogle, Microsoft, Amazon all recognize this as the greatest opportunity for growth and also a noble mission of improving health\nStartups, some governments like in China, the UK and other places are taking interest and investing in this space \nThe FDA has selectively approved algorithms for reading various types of scans, but such algorithms are widespread  in China, for example \n\nConsumer-approved AI \nApple Watch algorithm for atrial fibrillation \n“A lot of people have an Apple Watch who are young and have zero risk of atrial fibrillation and they get a cardiogram and it gets them anxious and they may even get workups by a cardiologist. This is a problem where we have marketing of an algorithm, the first deep learning algorithm in medicine” – Eric Topol, M.D.\n\nAn FDA consumer-approved algorithm is the Apple Watch for heart arrhythmia – a deep learning algorithm for atrial fibrillation\nAlgorithm was first developed by startup, AliveCor, and apple was a year later \n\nHow it works \n\nA one-lead cardiogram reads for atrial fibrillation with a 90% or more accuracy level\nTakes a matter of hours to learn a person well enough to make recommendations for a cardiogram but cannot diagnose anything else like ventricular rhythm (algorithms have not been validated yet)\n\n\nFigure 1. How the Apple Watch measures your heart rate. Image Credit: apple.com\nOpportunity for developments: six-lead and 12-lead cardiogram\n\nEric uses a six-lead cardiogram with patients where the sensors are put on the leg\nWith every patient, Eric takes their pulse as well as the six-lead cardiogram\nThis allows Eric to see if they \n\n1) have an arrhythmia, and \n2) have any conduction system abnormalities\n\n\n\n \nPatients could even do this test on their own at home at some point\n\nCould perform a stress test from the phone and reveal heart rhythm abnormalities (precursor to arrythmia \nThe results go to their phone and it creates a PDF which can be sent to your doctor\n“You can do a stress electrocardiogram, high quality, six lead and never go near a [doctor’s office]”\n\n“With AI, you could impute all 12 leads. You don’t even need to get the other six leads. Pretty soon we’re going to see that six lead become really valuable entry for what’s going on in a person’s heart.” – Eric Topol, M.D.\n\nMayo clinic recently published papers on 12-lead cardiograms\nAs one report suggests, in addition to heart function, predicting atrial fibrillation, the application of artificial intelligence to the ECG may enable screening for dangerous potassium levels (hyperkalemia) \n\n“It exemplifies what we can’t see, but having a machine trained by a million cardiograms, what it can see…The eye opening thing to me is to learn about all the things that we humans can’t do, that machines can be trained to do, and then [what is] just going to get better over time” – Eric Topol, M.D.\n \nGut microbiome—Its role in health, impact on glycemic response and fuel partitioning, and how deep learning could improve our research and treatment [1:18:00]\nCGM discussion:\n-Peter on how AI could impact continuous glucose monitoring:\n\n“If there’s anything that’s ripe for AI, it would also be CGM coupled with other data. In other words, I don’t think the CGM data as the input feed would be sufficient. You’d have to constantly be pairing it with your activity and other sensors. . .If you had the cortisol sensor and the lactate sensor, then that starts to become remarkable predictive power.”\n\n-Peter’s dream with the CGM:\n\n“This is my pipe dream is I want to be able to say, “Go into the algorithm and tell it your desired average glucose, your desired variability. I want an average glucose that’s below a hundred milligrams per deciliter or below 110 milligrams per deciliter. I want a standard deviation that doesn’t exceed 15 milligrams per deciliter. Now you tell me what I can eat. Spend the first month watching me eat, learning how my body responds to every different food and go from there.”\n",

We’re chipping away at that.”\n\nAI and the gut microbiome\n\nEric is a big proponent of gut health\nPeter is a “gut skeptic” and is waiting to see an example of how gut microbiome can change patient health (outside of cases like  C. difficile colitis and in patients with diabetes who undergo gastric bypass) \n\nGut microbiome research\n-Applied machine learning:\n\nDNA of the microbiome is stable from day to day, so analysis would remain relevant for a period of time\nA study demonstrates a devised a machine-learning algorithm integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota to accurately predicts personalized glycemic response to real-life meals\n\n-Microbiome research:\n\nChallenges in microbiome research:\n\nChanges in bacteria species sequence is just as important as the density of the type of bacteria \nSequencing species and evaluating density is expensive to do correctly \nAnd there’s been bad players in this space: uBiome were billing people illegitimately and they were only reporting on density of bacteria \n\n\nDevelopments\n\n\nPeter says he finds Larry Smarr’s work to be the most interesting as he uses shotgun sequencing of bacteria (“true metagenomics”)\nRobert Knight and his lab use metagenomics in the microbiome project that sequences each species of every organism that’s found\nWe now know that that genome sequence is equally as important as the type of bacteria\nHowever, “we have no idea how to manipulate the gut microbiome”\n\nPeter’s skeptical take on the gut’s impact on glycemic response to foods:\n\nEric brings up that Tim Spector has published twin studies suggesting that even identical twins respond differently to food (e.g., triglyceride levels) due to variation in the gut microbiome\nPeter says he needs to re-read the Weizmann paper because he has more questions\nFor one, he thinks that perhaps using the CGM and dietary logging would have been sufficient and that the gut microbiome may not have really “added” anything above those things\nFurthermore, if you have realtime lactate you are estimating mitochondrial oxidation and therefore fuel partitioning\nSo, for example, the reason that right now Peter’s glucose is 94 and if he ate a bagel it would only go up to 104 is because he’s so glycogen depleted from not eating for 20 hours and having worked out\nConversely, after a big dinner which spiked your glucose to 120, and then it comes down to 94, if you were to eat that same bagel under those new conditions it would spike glucose much higher\nA very important input into predicting that variation in how your blood glucose is going to respond to a particular meal is knowing glycogen stores and insulin sensitivity of the muscle and all these other things. \nRegarding the role of the gut, Peter is wanting to know: How many different macro phenotypes of gut biome are there that really matter?\n\n-Eric’s response:\n\nHe’s not quite as convinced as Peter that normalizing your glucose and insulin changes your long term prognosis\nHe leans towards believing that each person’s unique individual response throughout their day is impacted by the gut\nBut… he understands the skeptical point of view on the gut and says: “it is early stages of research and the importance of studying the gut still needs to be validated”\n\n \nWhy machines combined with human doctors is superior to one without the other [1:32:15]\nHow machines can help our biggest blind spot\nWhat is the biggest blind spot with human physicians?\n\n“I think the biggest blind spot is how poor we are in diagnosis.”\nEric says that 40% of doctors who claim to know why a patient died are wrong after autopsy results\nIf a doctor is able to make a diagnosis for a patient in 5 minutes, they are 95% accurate, but if it takes them longer than that their accuracy falls to 24%\n\n“We just are reflexive. We don’t reflectively go over anything. We don’t have time, we don’t assimilate all the data. We can’t because there’s so much . . . [we have to ] acknowledge that we can do far better but it can’t all be through human support. We need help.” – Eric Topol, M.D.\nMachines plus humans will always be better than just machine or just humans\n\nMachines can vastly improve areas like radiology and critical care\nBut humans will always be better at the interaction with other humans and the connection/bond\nMachines don’t have the context and deep, human nuanced issues that doctors can pick up\n\n“They [machines] don’t have context. They’re not going to be able to truly understand all the nonverbal communication and the real issues of a person that are deep. And that’s where the humanity, we need to bring it back. I mean the essence of medicine is that, and it’s been lost. It’s become this big business.” – Eric Topol, M.D.\n \nHow AI and machines can reinstate medicine as an attractive career (and alleviate physician burnout) [1:37:00]\n\nPhysician burnout is an issue and is at its peak\nPhysicians have I become data clerks and they’re squeezed for time, and they can’t care for people when they don’t have time\nMedicine as a career has become less and less attractive\nMachines can help give doctor’s their time back\n\n“The main thesis [of the book] is the gift of time. We can get that. But I think we have to restore medicine the way it was in order to attract the talent … and I think it’s doable, it’s not going to be easy, it’s going to require a lot of activism, which we haven’t had that much of, in medicine” – Eric Topol, M.D.\nWhy physicians should organize together:\n\nPhysicians need to organize in order to restore a former medical care standard\nThere are a million physicians in the country (900,000 who are actually practicing)\nEric published an article in The New Yorker on why doctors should organize to meet the challenges of modern medicine\nAn article published on the position of American physicians on firearms incited the reaction of the NRA\nJudy Melinek, a forensic pathologist, tweeted in response to the NRA’s reaction and Melinek’s tweet went viral\n\n“And the hope is that we’re going to see an organization take hold where all doctors can join as well as ultimately patient advocates and others. And that we will turn this around. Because, this is the biggest concern I have … is that we’re going to see AI kick in more and more over the years. But what will it do if the administrators, who are the overlords, who are overrepresented as compared to the people taking care of patients, if they keep the squeeze on? We’re just going to see things get worse. So we have to override that and the only way we’re going to do that and turn inward and get humanity back in medicine is to have doctors organize and the gravitas of a million doctors in America all being part of one entity” – Eric Topol, M.D.\nAI implications for both doctors and patients\n“… the machine story is not just about doctors relying more on machines getting support, it’s also about consumers, patients. And so when you get the outsourcing and the offloading, you start to see a pretty big… And then when you get rid of the hospital story and just have surveillance centers, remote monitoring, you start to see a very less need for expansion. So I don’t see we’re going to be a decline, but just a difference in the curves as they go forward over the next few decades” – Eric Topol, M.D.\n\nWe will need more doctors because of the aging population\nAt the same time, patients will be empowered with their own data so there will be less requirement for doctor-led diagnoses of the most common conditions \nThe medical specialities will shift away from a common-treatment focus \n\n \nEric’s dream experiment [1:47:30]\n“…the point being is when a new person comes in and we want to prevent a condition or better treat it, and we have billions of other people to draw from, and we have these digital twins, if you will. Because today we learn from clinical trials and it’s really farcical in many respects…so my experiment would be just for that: You have pinpoint precision … and what treatment they got and what outcomes they got and how I can prevent their issue that they otherwise had. And so it would be to develop the ultimate learning health system” – Eric Topol, M.D.\nThe vision would require U.S. and China collaboration\nAI multimodal collection \n\nEric and colleague Kai-Fu Lee wrote an article outlining how optimizing deep-learning solutions in healthcare will require collaboration between the United States and China  \nThe experiment would be to develop a planetary digital infrastructure with all the data of each individual and continually assess and assimilate processed inputs: federated AI\nWith China and U.S. collaboration – diversity and population largeness – pretty soon there will be “twins” to inform identical treatment protocol \nThe genome will never be fully deterministic; it can be probabilistic but is hampered by inadequate numbers\n\n\nProof of concept\n\nThe data already exists but is fragmented\nOnce you develop it at some scale, you still have to prove that it’s helping people\n\n",
