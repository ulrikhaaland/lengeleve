There are almost an infinite number of variations\nA tool to measure proxies of the benefits of these types of fast may help us elucidate what’s effective\nProtocol may need to be customized (i.e., different tactics for the same strategy): would two people benefit equally or does a certain phenotype/genotype do better on a particular regimen?\n\nNothingburger rationale\nFront-end ketogenic diet (KD) rationale:\n\nGoing into a fast from a high-carbohydrate state is more painful\nIt’s more of an abrupt shift from glucose metabolism to ramping up the process of making ketones, which is critical in starvation\n\nBack-end KD rationale:\n\nWard off going crazy on the on the refeed\nPeter likes symmetry\n\nMethods\nBaseline & Study Population (n = Peter)\nWeek 1: KD | July 8-14, 2018\n\n7-days (days 1-7)\n~30-40 gm carbs (total, not net), ~110-120 gm protein, high fat; no attention to caloric intake\nLabs: 7/13/18\nIncreased magnesium intake, bouillon supplementation as needed\n\nWeek 2: H2O-only fast | July 15-21, 2018\n\n7-days (days 8-14)\nSome decaf tea, mostly water (including, of course, Topo Chico)\nLabs: 7/20/18\nIncreased magnesium intake, regular bouillon supplementation\n\nWeek 3: KD | July 22-28, 2018\n\n7-days (days 15-21)\nNutrition same as week 1\nLabs: 7/27/18\nIncreased magnesium intake, bouillon supplementation as needed\n\nBaseline measurements\nTable 1.

Please understand, it does not. I track a number of things with this regimen and tweak it constantly based on what I measure, which goes far beyond the bloodwork shown here.

Not clear if this is ideal or cycling from low to high is better.\n\n\nThe KD was a little more fast and loose (“smokin’ and jokin’ as Peter said) than his previous journeys into NK; not obsessing over BHB levels, etc.\nTrailing CGM went down a little\n\nNote on uric acid: one alternative explanation for the spike in uric acid is provided by Steve Phinney and Jeff Volek on their blog: competition between ketones and uric acid for renal excretion.\nThey write:\nTo protect the body’s acid-base balance against too much acid from the diet or produced by our metabolism, our kidneys have the capacity to identify and actively clear organic acids from the blood. To some degree, at the onset of nutritional ketosis, this seems to be indiscriminate – it treats uric acid (which can be toxic when it builds up in the blood) and non-toxic levels of ketones all the same. So at the start of nutritional ketosis, these two organic acids compete for excretion, causing blood uric acid to rise despite no increase in its production.\n\nFigure 1.

Peter is using THD (i.e., the higher estimate).\nWeek 2 results & discussion [48:45]\n\nAble to now look at trailing 7-day CGM (rather than comparing to trailing 90-day CGM from baseline): a much greater sense of what’s happening in the past week from a glucose perspective\nBouillon more regularly, had some caffeine-free tea\nSurprised to see TGs after the fast not lower\nOxidized LDL (oxLDL) looked great\nUric acid elevated: getting into the gout attack range\n\nCould be a signature for autophagy in here (“In humans, the final compound of purines catabolism is uric acid” [Maiuolo et al., 2016])\nThis may be the single most important biomarker change Peter observed in the entire “experiment,” given his interest in understanding signatures of autophagy\n\n\nBUN went down to 12 as expected (body is sparing nitrogen and wasting as little as possible, given the complete absence of nitrogen ingestion)\nAdiponectin did not go up which was surprising (adiponectin goes up when lipolysis goes up)\nfT3/rT3 ratio of 0.05 is the lowest PA has ever seen, in any patient, at any time\n\nHe felt very cold during the fast, indicating hypothyroidism\nAlso may explain why weight did not drop even more\n\n\nFree testosterone dropped to the 15th percentile (very low for Peter)\nIGF-1 dropped to the 10th percentile\nHemoglobin/Hematocrit went down, very likely due to lower testosterone and perhaps some hemodilution since Peter made a great effort to remain hydrated\nWeight down about 10 lbs from baseline\nKetones increased as expected\n7-day trailing CGM went down to 79 mg/dL, almost 20 mg/dL during 2 weeks (Peter suspected if he continued the fast, the CGM would nadir at about 70 mg/dL)\n\nWeek 3 results & discussion [59:00]\n\nFirst day a little higher in carbs\nVery high TGs at the end of week 3: from 54 at baseline to 229, a 324% increase; had only seen TG this high once before (paradoxically, it was on a blood test where LDL-P was especially low—about 300 nmol/L during one blood test back in 2011 or 2012)\nTrying to understand why LDL-P would go so low after a ketogenic diet, and why TGs would get so high\nCRP >1\n\nPeter said he was consuming a ton of dairy via whipped heavy cream\nExercise can elevate CRP (but Peter rested the day prior to labs and he never has a CRP above 1.0 unless sick, which he was not at this time)\n\n\nHomocysteine (Hcy) and uric acid returned to baseline\nThyroid was moving back in the right direction\nSex hormones made a comeback\n\nPeter’s “Top 6” surprises from the fasting experiment [1:08:30]\n\nRelatively trivial weight loss (objective) and muscle loss (subjective, based on progression of 4 pictures, above)\nEnormous improvement in Peter’s sleep, especially delta wave (III/IV) and the feeling of being totally rejuvenated by even shorter amounts of sleep (typically only 6 hours)\nA feeling of calmness and presentness Peter’s never experienced before in his meditation, which extended into all activity, including walking, sitting, and working\nThe most bizarre paradox of physical performance: virtually no deterioration of strength (on at least one lift—rows—Peter felt stronger than ever), but complete destruction of even low end aerobic activity (walk) and high end aerobic (Peloton)\nDeterioration of peripheral thyroid function (biochemically with the lowest fT3 to rT3 I have ever seen in 6 years of seeing hundreds of these) and symptomatically (never more ‘cold’ in his life)\nComplete elimination of a chronic pain in Peter’s right wrist and near-complete elimination of pain in left elbow (these had been issues for 18 and 12 months, respectively, and the left elbow was so bad it was interfering with ability to hold bow steady).\n\nDifferent FMD protocols [1:29:20]\n\nPeter has done different variations of an FMD\nThe Prolon FMD (Table 3) is relatively higher in carbohydrate than a KD (Figure 2)\nImportant to remember the context: an FMD may be 47% carbohydrates, but for an 82 kg individual, it works out to ~1 gm carbohydrate/kg of body weight (days 2-5), whereas the same individual consuming 3,000 kcal/d, it would work out to 4.3 gm/kg\nOne variation is a KD version of an FMD (i.e., lower in carbohydrate and higher in fat compared to Prolon)\nAnother variation is a TRF-FMD: Peter has one meal a day of rice and salad, typically lower in protein than Prolon\n\nTable 3.
