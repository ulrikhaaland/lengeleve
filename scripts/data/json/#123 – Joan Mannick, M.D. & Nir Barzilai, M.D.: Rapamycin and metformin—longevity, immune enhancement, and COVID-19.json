Based on his work with metformin, Nir shares how he believes it could be a pro-longevity drug and the clinical trial he’s leading to test this belief. Joan discusses her work with rapalogs, their ability to suppress the immune system as well as provide immune-enhancement, and the clinical trials she has led that inform her insights. We also talk about the potential beneficial roles of both metformin and rapamycin in reducing mortality from COVID-19, reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and delaying aging as well as its related diseases.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#123 - Joan Mannick, M.D. & Nir Barzilai, M.D.: Rapamycin and metformin—longevity, immune enhancement, and COVID-19\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#123 - Joan Mannick, M.D. & Nir Barzilai, M.D.: Rapamycin and metformin—longevity, immune enhancement, and COVID-19\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#123 - Joan Mannick, M.D. & Nir Barzilai, M.D.: Rapamycin and metformin—longevity, immune enhancement, and COVID-19\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t",

We have all ages, all the old age-related disease, clinical association studies, we’d have mortality. That just made metformin the perfect tool for us to push geroscience ahead.” —Nir Barzilai\nITP studies\nWhat is the ITP?\n\nThe interventions testing program is a multi-institutional program established to test diets, supplements, and drugs purported to extend lifespan and delay disease and dysfunction to evaluate whether or not there is an effect on longevity\nSee this paper describing how the ITP studies are designed\nYou have a committee, you get the drug, you have animals who are genetically heterogeneous, they animals get the drug in the same was in three different centers around the United States so that we have a standard way to say “yes or no” to whether it’s pro-longevity\n\nIn cohort 7, they tested metformin alone, and metformin plus rapamycin, in mice—\n\nMetformin only:\n\nIn two of the centers, the mice they lived longer (13% and 10%)\nBut in the third center, mice lived 1% less\n\n\nMetformin plus rapamycin:\n\nMice had a 23% increase in lifespan\nThese are the longest-living animals so far in the ITP\n\n\n\nITP studies for rapamycin alone—\n\nIn cohort 2, mice given rapamycin alone starting at 20 months of age extended lifespan by 14% in females and 9% in males\nIn cohort 3, mice given rapamycin alone starting at 9 months of age extended lifespan by 10% in males and 18% in females\nSee the ongoing ITP studies looking at rapamycin: The Rapamycin Phase II Study – Tissues Available for Collaborative Studies\n\nThe lack of enthusiasm about metformin for longevity\n\nIn the metformin alone ITP studies, 1 of the 3 sites showed no improvement of lifespan\nThis means there are now people who are not impressed with metformin as a longevity agent\n*But Nir makes the following point: It’s a little bit too late to discuss mice now, because we have all this data in humans. It’s possible that metformin will have a better effect in humans than in mice.\n\n \nHow metformin and rapamycin impact the hallmarks of aging and extend lifespan [24:15]\nNir’s recent paper in Cell Metabolism: Benefits of Metformin in Attenuating the Hallmarks of Aging\n\nFigure 1. Mechanisms of metformin action in attenuating hallmarks of biological aging—The cellular uptake of metformin is via the organic cationic transporter 1 (OCT1), after which it exerts three arms of action- 1) metabolic; 2) oxidative and 3) inflammatory. 1) Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I and thereby oxidative phosphorylation leading to an increased AMP:ATP ratio, causing a direct activation of AMPK. AMPK-dependent mechanisms (blue) contribute to the downstream inhibition of mTORC1 (improved nutrient-sensing and autophagy), activation of PGC-1α (improved mitochondrial biogenesis), transcriptional regulation via DNA/histone modifications and miRNAs. Extracellularly, metformin downregulated Insulin/IGF1 signaling, also leading to mTORC1 inhibition. 2) The inhibition of mitochondrial ETC also leads to AMPK-independent effects (red) including reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and thereby reduced macromolecular damage. 3) The AMPK-independent (red) anti-inflammatory and senotherapeutic effects of metformin are evident via the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, NF-κB signaling, and activation of Nrf2-Gpx7 and ATM-signaling, respectively. These three arms work to mitigate the aging-induced dysregulation in cells, thereby attenuating hallmarks of aging. Image credit: Kulkarni et al., 2020",

    "content": "\nHow Metformin is working for longevity \n\nNir does NOT believe metformin independently targets all of the hallmarks of aging\nLet’s say that, on the cellular level, it fixes aging\nAnd once it fixes cellular aging, a lot of things improve\nFor example, maybe the fact that insulin levels go down doesn’t ONLY have to do with metformin’s effect on glucose, but because…\n\nAutophagy has increased\nMitochondrial function is better\nGenetic stability is good\nEtc.\n\n\nAfter an experiment where you see so much effect, some might say it’s all epigenetics, but the question is: Did metformin do it? Or is it what metformin did on aging that created the effects?\n\nThree major arms of metformin\n\nMetabolic—targets complex I in the mitochondria which increases AMPK and targets the mTOR pathway\nThere’s a decrease in oxidative stress (ROS production) and a decrease in DNA damage (a consequence of using a low dose of a mitochondrial poison)\nThe relationship to immune function and inflammation\n\n“We have the clinical data on metformin, but I wouldn’t tell you what exactly is the most relevant target in the whole.” —Nir Barzilai\nMechanisms for how rapamycin (and rapalogs) might extend lifespan\n1—Less protein and lipid synthesis which may decrease proteotoxic stress just by having less proteins made that your protein degradation system has to deal with\n2—Autophagy, however, rapalogs don’t consistently induce autophagy\n\nIt’s cell-dependent—so how much of a role autophagy has in the benefits of rapalog is probably tissue-dependent\nIn many cell lines, there’s no induction of autophagy\nIn the few cell lines that do have induction of autophagy, it’s hard to distinguish the tissue of origin (e.g., Is it the liver versus the cells from neurons?) \n\n3—Regulation of the SASPs (similar to metformin)\n\nSenescent cells accumulate as we age resulting in the secretion of inflammatory cytokine\nInhibiting mTOR will decrease SASPs, which will decrease systemic inflammation\n\n \nEnhancing the immune system with rapalogs and metformin [34:15]\nWhy immune enhancement matters\n\nFrom a longevity standpoint—\n\nAnything that you can do that’s going to enhance the immune system at the adaptive level (which is what you’re getting out of a vaccine) is going to help with cancer surveillance\nPrior to COVID-19, Peter’s thought was that the real reason we want to have enhanced immunity is to delay the onset of cancer\n\n\nToday, there’s a heightened focus on coronavirus as well as influenza which makes enhancing immunity more relevant to the present moment\n\nImmune enhancement via rapalogs\nWhy did T cells get better at recognizing an antigen when a patient was pulsed with a drug that is inhibiting senescent cells? (Tissue specific or cell specific autophagy? Reduction in protein synthesis and lipid synthesis?)\n\nIt’s going to be complicated, says Joan\nBut one of the factors and how you respond to a vaccine is actually innate immunity —  you need innate immunity to bring in the adaptive T and B cells to respond to antigen \n\nWhere some of the issues lie for the elderly population—\n\nThey have a defect in type I interferon production after getting a flu vaccine\nThere are all sorts of stimuli to the innate immune system that should induce interferon, but there’s a defect in immune cells\nWith aging comes exhaustion of T cells — but with mTOR inhibition, there’s a decrease in exhausted T-cells in older humans (Tyler Curiel showed the same thing in older mice)\n\nPossible solutions?\n\nJoan has shown that with mTOR inhibitors, you can enhance interferon production in interferon induced gene expression\n\nIn other words, you are enhancing the innate immune function which is helping the adaptive immune system work better when you get vaccinated\n\n\nWhen you give an mTOR inhibitor, in particular a rapalog, T cell exhaustion decreases\n\nJoan says that they don’t yet know the mechanism for that\n\n\n\nNOTE: You can’t just give IV interferon because \n\n1) it’s dangerous, and \n2) It’s not the interferon per se, it’s that the lack of interferon is a proxy for a failure to recognize in the first place\n",

    "content": "\nWhat did Joan learn about this in her 2014 paper? Did they look only at T cell or also B cell assays? Did you look at neutralizing antibodies and T cell killing?\n\nThey only looked at hemagglutination inhibition (HI titers)\nDidn’t look at neutralizing antibodies and didn’t look at T cell function\nThey looked at shifts in 76 different peripheral blood subsets—the rapalogs didn’t shift any of the subsets very much, except there was about a 25 to 30% decrease in the PD1, CD4, and CD8—the exhausted T-cells that accumulate with age\nThe fact that these go down may indicate another part of the adaptive immune system that’s getting improved from the rapalog\n\nImmune benefits of metformin\nWhen did it become apparent to Nir that metformin had immune benefits?\n\nIn the 40s-60s, metformin was used around the world for influenza in the elderly\n\nThe literature is in Czech and Swedish and Philippines—with little translation to date—but all of them were positive responses to using Metformin as an immune enhancer against the flu, malaria, and some other indications\n\n\nPatients with type 2 diabetes who were taking metformin immunized better against the flu\n\n \nPotential of metformin and rapamycin in reducing mortality from COVID-19 [41:30]\nIn the case of COVID-19, we need a drug that will—\n\nEnhance immune function \nDecrease the cytokine storm/inflammatory response\nHelp the elderly body sustain a severe disease (i.e., be tough when faced with severe disease)\nAdditionally, you probably wouldn’t just increase their immunity by 10 to 20%, you would reduce their comorbidities first and foremost\n\nMetformin and rapamycin \n\nThese drugs can reduce comorbidities—and by doing so that may confer the mortality benefit as much so as their ability to enhance the immune system\nIt’s also important to note that the reduction in comorbidities and the enhancement of the immune system are NOT dependent on each other\n\nDiabetics on metformin vs. diabetics NOT on metformin\nA paper from China looked at 283 diabetic patients with COVID-19\n\n104 of them came to the hospital already taking metformin\n179 of them were not taking metformin\nJust 2.9% of people on metformin died versus 12.3% of the to no-metformin group who died\n\n\nFigure 2. Although no significant difference was found in the hospital stays between two groups (P = 0.74), the in-hospital mortality of 2.9% (3/104) in the metformin group was markedly decreased compared with the mortality of 12.3% (22/179) in the no-metformin group (P = 0.01). Image credit: Luo et al., 2020\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the use of metformin in China for diabetic people is between 60 and 70% — yet, the most people who were hospitalized were NOT using metformin\n\nThe implication of this observation is potentially that \n\ni) the diabetics on metformin were less likely to need to go to the hospital (or maybe even get COVID-19 at all), and\nii) The mortality from COVID-19 probably had more to do with the cytokine storm/inflammatory response, or with their ability to handle severe disease, than it did with the immunization\n\n\n\n\n\nContrasting influenza with COVID-19\n\nThe main train of thought about how influenza kills people used to be that it can paralyze the immune system making the individual more susceptible to other infections such as a bacterial infection \nHowever, Joans says that may not be the case\nThere is now some debate around that due to a 2015 NEJM paper which looked at what actually causes pneumonia in the elderly that gets them hospitalized\n\nAnd it’s not mainly because of a combination of virus and bacteria (that is some of it) but the majority is the virus itself\nThe most common virus is actually rhinovirus—the cause of the common cold\nThe elderly just can’t handle viruses the same way as younger people do — and they can die without getting bacterial superinfection\nThe virus itself causes damage, and then the immune response to the virus also causes damage\n\n\n\nHow does that impact our thinking about SARS-CoV-2?\n\nIt causes much more direct damage to the pneumocyte, therefore to the end organ",

So I think it’s okay five days later, it can still be effective.”\nMetformin should be used to prevent, not treat, COVID-19\n\n“People should get metformin to prevent COVID-19, not to treat COVID-19.” —Nir Barzilai\nRapalog and the prevention of mortality from COVID-19\nPrevention of infection\n\nFirst, there is some data that mTOR inhibitors may interact directly with SARS-CoV-2 and inhibit replication—a direct antiviral effect that’s seen with CMV and BK virus in transplant patients where they have lower CMV and BK viral infections, probably because of a direct effect of mTOR inhibition\nAny evidence of that in the other four coronaviruses that commonly occur?\n",

If we have a vaccine that doesn’t protect the elderly, we did nothing.” —Nir Barzilai\nAnother vaccine concern—Is long-term immunity even possible?\n\nIt’s common to have only a year or less of immunity to other versions of coronavirus after being infected\nSo there’s a legitimate concern that a vaccine for COVID-19 will not be enough to create herd immunity in the long run \n“The probability then that a vaccine is going to provide lifelong immunity the way we get it from several of our most famous vaccines, seems quite low.” says Peter\nNow we have a fifth coronavirus that’s here to stay, but unlike its other four cousins, this one can really whack you\nWe NEED a better strategy around immune enhancement and immune-targeted therapies for the most immune-vulnerable (e.g., monoclonal antibodies)\n\n⇒ See Link to episode of The Drive with David Watkins for more on monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine strategies for COVID-19\nA new awareness on the importance of immune enhancement\n\nJoan says the one positive from the COVID-19 pandemic is that it’s created an awareness that immune enhancement is an important issue\nPrior to this pandemic, nobody really cared about respiratory tract infections, they cared about cancer and other rare diseases\nBut not Joan says there’s “bandwidth” to see if they can figure out the efficacy of rapalogs for immune enhancement to stop things like severe infections to COVID-19\n\n \nThe potential role of rapalogs and metformin in neurodegenerative disease [1:14:30]\nParkinson’s disease and rapamycin\n\nFor Parkinson’s disease—and other neurodegenerative diseases—there’s an accumulation of toxic protein aggregates\nIf you enhance autophagy in preclinical models that has benefit\nRapalogs aren’t great at inducing autophagy, but RTB101 at high doses is very good at inducing autophagy although it’s hard to achieve those concentrations in the brain\nBut… if you combine a rapalog with RTB101, you can lower the concentration of RTB101 that’s needed to induce autophagy so you don’t have to get so much across the blood brain barrier \nThat was the logic behind resTORbio’s ongoing trial which is using that combination for Parkinson’s disease\n\n⇒ Matt Kaeberlein wrote a piece explaining the potential to both ameliorate and potentially clean up a lot of the protein aggregation/disaggregation that’s occurring in the central nervous system (CNS)\n",

Image credit: Kaeberlein and Galvan, 2019\nThe role of metformin in the risk reduction for Alzheimer’s\n\nAnything that normalizes glucose and insulin, as metformin does, is going to have a direct benefit on dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\n\nIs there any direct data that suggests that metformin should be a part of the toolkit to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease?\n\nNot directly, says Nir\nHowever, there are two NIH funded projects that will take a couple of years to look at people with MCI\nOne study looking at MCI and metformin showed decreased deterioration in some of the domains of Alzheimer’s disease\n\nFor the studies that DON’T show improvement, Nir offers these possible explanations—\n\nOne, they’re from China so either it’s not similar mechanisms, or the genetics and environmental interaction somehow\nSecondly, and more likely…\n\nMetformin delays mortality by 20% which therefore means you’ll get more people on metformin living longer\nSo it might just be the number of the people on metformin that have Alzheimer’s increases because they are hanging around longer. \n\n\n*This is why we need clinical studies and not association studies*\n\n \nNir’s TAME trial—primary objectives and latest updates [1:18:00]\nNir on metformin and rapamycin\n\nNir said he decided to focus his research on metformin NOT because it was the “best drug”\nIn fact, he believes rapamycin will a better longevity agent\nBut he chose metformin because his ultimate goal is to advance the field of preventing age-related diseases\nAnd because there was more data about the safety of metformin compared to rapamycin, he felt like it was the better path to advancing the field\n\nUpdate on Nir’s TAME studies\n\nPart of the problem with TAME is that there’s no commercial interest\nMetformin is a very cheap drug (cheaper than a placebo pill)\nSo nobody wants to pay for a Phase 3 study for five years\nThe American Federation of Aging Research (AFAR) is a group of people from a non-profit and non-industry that is supporting TAME\n\nTAME has 3 arms:\n 1—Prevention of age-related disease and mortality\n\nThis is the primary outcome/FDA outcome\nThis will cost about $35 million coming via the AFAR grant\n\n 2—Identifying biomarkers\n\nThey are going to make sure that they know what are the biomarkers for metformin action and for aging\nThis was funded by the NIA in order to take plasma and blood, DNA, and anything they need to be able to do omics and other things and find biomarkers\n\n 3—The geriatric part\n\nHow many hospitalizations? What’s the ADL? The frailty index? Etc. \nThis could be done at the very end looking at the people with metformin vs. without metformin\nThis hasn’t yet been funded\n\nOther aspects of TAME:\n\n3,000-3,500 subjects\n14 trial centers\nThey will also be able to look at immunity enhancement – for the flu vaccine and perhaps the future COVID-19 vaccine in 2021\n\n \nPotential synergistic effect when combining metformin with rapamycin [1:25:45]\nThere’s not a huge amount of mechanistic overlap between metformin and rapalogs, says Peter\nRapalogs—\n\nImpairing synthesis of proteins\nInhibiting SASPs\nSome autophagy (depending on the way that you inhibit and/or the tissue)\n\nMetformin—\n\nMetabolic benefits such as normalizing glucose and insulin\nDecreases oxidative stress \nDecreases inflammation\n\nCould there potentially be a benefit in combining metformin with a rapalog?\n\n“I don’t think we know enough, yet.” says Joan",

So is reversing a biologic clock going to mean you’re in a better state or not?”\nPeter adds,\n\nLet’s just say a person shows up at time T-naught, and they have methylation status M-naught\nYou then apply an intervention that is beneficial (rapamycin, metformin, etc.)\nFast forward to another time point—even if you have not undone methylation, how do you know you haven’t done good that is proactive as opposed to retroactive?\n\nNir says, \n“It’s one thing to have a biomarker that predicts biological age, but we want much more than that. We want biomarkers to predict if we’re targeting aging.”\nPatient case study:\n\nPeter’s patient used a clock that predicted his biological age to be 34 (younger than his chronological age)\nBut after a 5-day water only fast, the same biologic clock said his age was 27\nTo get 7 years younger in 5 days seems nonsensical—”You can reverse engineer these things in any way you want, actually.”\n\n“Every time I’ve looked at one of these, I have found the data to be somewhat unhelpful because I don’t know what to make of them.” —Peter Attia\nNir has a Nature Medicine paper with Tony Wyss-Coray doing a clock from proteomic viewpoint \n-Took thousands of patients between the age 65 and 95 and looked at proteins and asked: What does change between age 65 and 95?\n\nThe most important thing about the proteins was that there were a bunch of breakdowns in collagen, granular sites of platelets, etc.\nNir says he came to realize that these breakdowns are important biomarkers because what we’re going to do when “treating aging” (with metformin, rapamycin, etc.) is stop the breakdown that is typical to aging. \nProteomics are much more reactive than methylation, says Nir\n\nPeter’s overall thoughts on methylation and epigenetic clocks: “To me, the really interesting stuff is that the metabolomic, proteomic, transcriptomic level, of which maybe methylation becomes an additional thing that matters.
