Image credit: imdb.com\n\nChris felt there was something magical going on inside Gold’s Gym Venice\nThe ubiquity of steroid use\nChris saw the documentary Bowling for Columbine and decided he wanted to make a documentary on steroid use modeled after Bowling for Columbine\nOnce they started working on it, the editors and producers realized that the Bell brothers (Mark, Chris, and Mike) were the ones who needed to be filmed and they decided to focus on the Bell family\nMark and Mike were both on steroids, but Chris wasn’t but he was conflicted about whether he should or not\nThe producers realized that telling that story with honesty, about what’s actually going on, was the way to go\n\nPeter is struck by the empathy shown by Chris in the film\n\nA young boy, who was taking steroids, passed away\nChris was interviewing the father of the boy, who blamed steroids\nEven though Chris disagreed that his death was caused by steroid use, he didn’t take a “cross-examination” approach\n“I was just trying to figure out ways to not be mean-spirited to the guy but yet . . . make some points to him and hopefully like it’ll sink in with him. . . that’s sort of my approach is to like not really go in there with a mindset of ‘I’m going to destroy this person’ because . . . we are all human beings we’re all in this big soup together . . . we all have to function together so like to pick a side and stand there just doesn’t seem to make any sense”\n“So I think that that’s my philosophy. . . to try to keep the peace so that after the film we can still continue to have a relevant and smart intelligent conversation about the subject matter”\n\nPeter credits Bigger, Stronger, Faster for getting him to revisit his set of beliefs regarding steroids\n\nAlways assumed steroids must be terrible for you and dangerous\nHe remembers the Sports Illustrated cover with Lyle Alzado\nAfter watching the documentary, Peter describes his realization as follows: “It was an opinion that had been passed down and passed down but I hadn’t actually submitted myself to the discomfort of thought”\nPeter also quotes JFK, “For the greatest enemy of truth is very often not the lie, deliberate, contrived, and dishonest but the myth, persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the cliches of our forebears. We subject all facts a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.”\n\nChris’s personal story of addiction and how he’s using his experience to help others [17:30]\n\nChris’s credits his dad for recognizing something and calling him out, “I don’t know what’s wrong with you but you’re a drug addict or an alcoholic or something. . . you’re not right”\nCaused Chris to break down in tears, “worst feeling you could possibly have is that you let your father down”\n\nMark’s perspective on Chris struggle\n\nChris and Mark had an older brother (Mike) that they had already lost to substance abuse\nMark comments that the battle with addiction is never over, compares it to strength training, you will never reach a spot where you think ‘this is perfect, where I want to be’\nHe is amazed at where Chris is today, “like he restarted his like at 40 years old”\n\nMark tells the story of the turning point\n\nGot a frantic call from Chris’s girlfriend that Chris was passed out and wouldn’t wake up\nConvinced Chris to fly to Sacramento and be with the family\nSent him to detox (zero contact for 3-4 days)\nRehab for 60-70 days\nBest thing they did as a family is they had an intervention and Chris revealed, “I feel alone”\nThey made the point to surround him with family, his parents playing a huge role\nFamily support is what made (and is making) the difference\n\nHelping others\n“I never wanted to be a drug addict or an alcoholic but thank God for it, because I think that it’s helped me to really help other people,” says Chris\n\nChris feels like he has an ability to inspire people to take initiative in their lives, to get involved with something and go for it\nHe stresses the importance of surrounding yourself with a support group\nChris’s goal is to simply help people lead a healthier lifestyle, physically and mentally\nMark and Chris say their first prescription for everyone who is struggling is simply to get up and start moving, even if it’s just a 10-minute walk, just start\n",

[33:45]\n\nPeter is fascinated by what drove Brothers Bell to be extraordinary because their story is NOT what he would have expected, which is that some childhood trauma drove them to work hard which resulted in mostly positive things but sometimes goes off the rails (addiction), but it’s kind of the opposite\nBell brothers say they had a tremendous childhood, very loving\nMark says, “We had the ability to dream because our dad provided and mom provided that for us. That’s all we had to worry about as kids were to dream big. That’s it.”\n\nThe things that inspired their course in life\n\nFigure 2. Hulk Hogan pins The Iron Sheik in 1984. Image credit: hulkhogan.com\n\nHuge fans of pro wrestling (WWE)\n\nThe day that changed their life: Hulk Hogan beat the Iron Sheik January 23, 1984, and from that point on all they could imagine for their future was being inside the wrestling ring\nMark, Chris, and Mike would never miss WrestleMania and would always choose going to Madison Square Garden as the one “special thing” they got to do with their dad every year\n\n\nInspired by their dad\n\nDad worked for IBM and gave his everything to the company for 20 years\nStuck in “corporate America”. . . job, family, job, family, repeat\nJust before he reached a milestone that would have given him a large payoff, he was let go\nBut they were inspired because he picked himself up and became even more successful on his own as an accountant and real estate investor\nThey wanted to pave their own path after this experience\n\n\n\nPeter interjects with an important observation about their father, “He still gave you guys everything. . .you never were without a hug, there was never a moment when you wanted to play with your dad and he wasn’t there. And so my guess is that would make it a lot more palatable when you get shit on by the man because can you imagine the guilt that would rest upon you if you’re doing all this stuff in service of your family right? You’re working this hard to provide for your family obviously but in the process, you’ve got to make these hard sacrifices to not spend time with your family and then, in the end, you get the shaft.”\nHow they got started lifting weights, powerlifting vs Olympic lifting, and personal records [43:30]\nThey first witnessed the raw strength of their older brother “Mad Dog” (Mike) who was squatting 400 lbs at age 16\nHow Chris got started:\n\nIn 10th grade, Chris had bone spurs in his knees and needed surgery\nHis chiropractor/strength coach said you need to learn to squat to help your knees (counterintuitive to Chris)\nStarted with broomstick learning to squat properly\nSlowly moved up in weight and 6 months later squatting 315 lbs for 8 reps\nEnded up squatting over 500 lbs while still in high school\nChris was squatting 675 by 19 years old\n\nMark points out their strength gains responded really well to heavy lifting but not a lot volume\n\nOne heavy lift and leave\nCoaches thought they were lazy\nThey looked up to Mike Mentzer who used this approach\n\nHow it started for Mark:\n\nWhen Mark was about 13 years old, their cousin (who was about 19) came over and challenged Mark to a “bench off”\nUp until that point, Mark had never really “maxed out” so was unsure how much he could lift\nThey kept adding weight, and his cousin fails at 205 lbs, but Mark got 240-250 lbs at age 13!\nIt’s in their genes: their mom benched 135 lbs never having benched in her life\n\nSteroid use in high school\n\nSteroid use at their high school was pretty rampant\nChris, who was against steroids back in the day, would wear a weightlifting belt with “Roids Suck” written across it\nThis would piss people off since most of them were on steroids, yet Chris was still stronger than them\nChris laughs about the irony that he made a movie later in life suggesting that maybe steroids are not all that bad for you\n\nOlympic lifting vs. Powerlifting\n\nOlympic lifting:\n\n2 lifts, the snatch, and the clean and jerk\n3 attempts at each lift\nthe highest score of each lift is taken and summed together to get your total score\n\n\nPowerlifting:\n\nNot an Olympic sport\nConsists of 3 lifts, squat, bench, deadlift in that order\n3 attempts at each lift\nSum up best lift of each for a total score\n\n\nPowerlifting is hard because it’s hard to have leverage on each of those lifts\nOlympic lifting is more about being more mobile and athletic around the weight\nMark and Chris practiced powerlifting more so than Olympic lifting\n\nPersonal records in powerlifting\nPeter’s PRs:\n\nPeter used powerlifting for boxing in high school\nWeighing about 160 lbs\nBench = 275 lbs\nSquat = 495 lbs\nDeadlift = 505 lbs\n\nMark’s PRs:\n\nUsing powerlifting gear (which gives you an advantage):\n\nSquat = 1080 lbs\nBench = 854 lbs\nDeadlift = 766 lbs\n\n\nRaw (without any gear or knee wraps):\n\nSquat = 700 lbs\nBench = 578 lbs\nDeadlift = 715 lbs\n\n\nMark says, “I was as strong as I could be. I don’t think I could have squeezed any more out of that. I pushed it as hard as I could. I got as big and as heavy as I could.”\nBut wishes he would have put more emphasis on his sleep habits\n\n\nFigure 3. Mark Bell: 556 lb Raw Bench Press. Image credit: Jim McDonald (YouTube)\nChris’s PRs:\n\nSquat = 675 lbs (assisted with gear)\nBench = 585 lbs (in a “bench shirt), 500 (raw)\n\nFor context:\n\nPeter points out that they could likely lay under the back of a car and bench press it off the ground\nMark says that typically, the strongest guys at “commercial gym” is maybe doing a 400 lb bench\n\nLifting weights: the importance of challenging yourself, how to avoid injury, monitoring progress, and staying motivated [1:02:30]\n\nPeter’s life revolves around getting his lifting in\nEspecially the main lifts like squat, bench, deadlift\nPeter’s #1 rule: Don’t get hurt\n\nMark agrees about the importance of safety, but if you are a young person first starting out, he would change the order:\n\nRule #1: Challenge yourself\nRule #2: Don’t get hurt\nImportant note: As you age, you might want to reverse that order\n“If you’re not challenging yourself, then you’re missing out on the big piece of the puzzle because you’re never going to get the results you’re looking for.”\n“It sounds foolish but. . .we’ve all been hurt in the gym and we’ve all learned a lot from it”\n\nImportance of warming up to avoid injury\n\nPeter says, “One of the most important realizations of my life was you can’t squat or deadlift until your glute med, your TFL, are working”\nMark adds that at a minimum, you have to move around\nFor upper body get the elbow and shoulder warm\nFor lower body, walk forward, backward, side to side, do some hip hinging, etc.\nMark and Chris sell a product called the hip circle which helps warm up the lower body\n\nFor more information about warming up your glutes and TFL, see this video series by Peter showing his warm-up routine.\nChallenging yourself to make progress\n\nThe more you grow in fitness, the harder it becomes to continue to make progress\nBut you have to find a way because to challenge yourself because, “Without progress…I don’t believe you can even have happiness,” says Mark\n\nMark on how to use small progress to keep yourself motivated\n\nThere is always something to chase, says Mark\nStart with low, attainable goals\nFavorite advice to give people, “do you know a way to get a PR every single time you set foot in the gym?”\nTry something you’ve never done before and then just keep working that up until you plateau\nYou can always try different rep ranges, “what’s your max set of 3 sets of 7 reps with one-minute rest on incline dumbbell press?”\n\nChris on how changing his diet changed his performance and life [1:09:15]\n“The number one thing for me that really changed my life altogether is my diet. . .what I put in my mouth affected what I did in the gym”\n\nWhen he was younger he would just eat like crazy and lift heavy\nMoved to California in 1993 and met up with Mike O’Hearn and Ron Fedkiw\nRon told Chris he was “too fat to be a good powerlifter”\nChris had never been able to lose weight until he explored the ketogenic diet\nRon told Chris to eat nothing but “red meat and water”\nChris followed the advice for about 3 weeks and lost over 20 pounds, but was still able to win the powerlifting competition\nPeter asks, how much strength did you lose when you lost weight?\n“I got stronger”\nBut for some reason he stopped doing it because he was “afraid” of the “weird” diet, he thought he needed carbohydrates\nHe recently got back into the ketogenic/carnivore diet in the last couple of years\n“I feel like those years in-between we’re lost. I feel like I ruined them. I feel like, because I wasn’t optimizing my training along with my diet, that I kind of wasted those years.”\n\nBest resources for those wanting to get started lifting weights effectively and safely [1:14:00]\nPeter likes to recommend Mark Rippetoe for those needing instruction for strength training\n\nYouTube: Starting Strength\nBook: Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training\n\nMark’s YouTube channel: Mark Bell – Sling Shot\n\nOver 3,000 videos\nIncluding instructional videos such as:\n\nVideos with Ed Coan, the “best squatter ever”\nVideos with Stan Efferding, the “strongest raw powerlifter ever”\n\n\n\nCrossFit\n\nMark believes CrossFit is a great place to start\nMark says “There has never in the history of the world has been a better fitness program than what Crossfit puts out. Nobody spends more time and more money on what they put together.”\n\nPowerlifting\n\nPowerlifting will help improve your fitness in many different sports\nBy powerlifting, you will not only learn valuable mechanics but you’ll also improve in your sport\n\nTeaching kids strength training early in life, the negative impact of sitting and how we can minimize it [1:18:30]\n“I would love it if each of my kids at least spends some time powerlifting because whatever you go to do later in life you will have correctly learned the mechanics of the most important movements in the human body,” says Peter\n\nJeff Martin (San Diego) has a program for kids called The Brand X Method\nMark did a seminar there and was blown away with how the kids were able to move\nTheir form on everything was impeccable\nAdults are harder to teach, less flexible, tighter in the hips, mental blocks due to a bad experience with lifting in the past\nPeter says his 4-year-old boy (not in school yet so doesn’t sit) and his squat form is great, but his daughter who is now 10 years and used to have great form but now it is horrible\n\n",

Image credit: Peter Attia (Instagram)\n\nPeter says that we are born with the ability to hip hinge and we lose it over time and would argue that “Sitting is the thing that cripples us”\nHe believes we can minimize this negative impact on kids with 2 things:\n\nStanding desks in school\nTeaching kids the types of exercises to do\n\n\nMark adds that we should be putting more of an emphasis on a “real” physical education in schools\n\nBenefits of bodybuilding, Mark’s prep for his first competition, and the role of the ketogenic diet [1:27:15]\n\nYou can see rapid changes with bodybuilding\nMark laments the state of the country and the bogus studies that he’s seen around training, “We’re in a country that’s so fat that there are studies that show that cardiovascular training is bad for you because it increases your estrogen and your cortisol so much you can’t release fat.”\nBut for years, bodybuilders have done things in very specific ways and it works time and time again\nMark believes the discipline you develop from sticking to a bodybuilding regimen is a powerful trait to have in your toolbox\n\nJay Cutler is the example of discipline\n\n4 time Mr. Olympia champion\nHe eats seven times a day, all meals are prepared, the same food at the same time every single day\nHe did his cardio at the same time\nHe does weightlifting at the same time\nHe would go tanning at the same time\nHot tub get a massage at the same time\nConsistent sleep\nAll those all these things were regimented out so that way he never skipped a beat and he could be the best\n\nMark transitions from powerlifting to bodybuilding at age 41 \nHe was already in the process of adjusting his diet to lose fat and was convinced by Hany Rambod (nutritionist for Phil Heath) on his Power Project podcast to go ahead and sign up for his first bodybuilding competition\nNOTE: Since this recording, Mark has already competed and won his first ever bodybuilding competition\n\nFigure 5. Mark wins bodybuilding competition. Image credit: Mark Bell (Instagram)\nFrom Mark’s YouTube channel: BEFORE AND AFTER BODYBUILDING TRANSFORMATION ft. Hany Rambod\nBodybuilding diet:\n\nMark’s diet for his upcoming competition\n\n7 meals per day\n350 g protein (50 g protein per meal)\n150 g carbs\n65 g fat\n\n\nMark points out that this might look like a lot but the average person eats 15 times per day (due to all the snacking)\n“You can actually handle eating a lot less than you’re currently eating is one thing to know and you can actually handle a lot more training. Now I’m not trying to suggest that you just get in this crazy mode of overtraining and develop body dysmorphia and all these things but I do think you could probably push yourself a lot further than you know…and when you go from not implementing bodybuilding stuff to implementing bodybuilding stuff it makes a huge difference.”\nHow much protein to eat?\nChris says when he increased his protein intake he saw major changes\nChris’s interpretation of the science is that you need 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight to elicit muscle growth\nFor bodybuilders, it’s important to get protein in at every meal (as opposed to all of it in one meal), because presumably amino acids have a relatively short residence and you’ve got to keep the exposure high to get the muscular hypertrophy\n\nMark’s starting and ending weight for the competition\n\nStarted around 245 lbs\nEnding weight probably around 215 lbs\nMark says after only losing about 10 lbs he could see a major difference when practicing posing (Posing video)\n“I actually think the lower that I weigh. . . the bigger that I’ll probably look”\n\nMark’s team and mentors\n\nHany Rambod – nutrition\nCharles Glass – posing\nMike O’Hearn – training\n\nMark’s macros:\n\n2,600 total calories\nProtein = 54%\nCarbs = 23%\nFat = 23%\n\nMark’s experience with the ketogenic diet and how it fits into bodybuilding\nMark’s experience: “The ketogenic diet has always worked really well for me because it’s allowed me to keep control over the amount of food that I eat. It’s one of the few things that has burned off my hunger. It’s one of the few things that have burned off my cravings. It’s the only thing that has ever done that before.”\nIn bodybuilding:\n\nFor the pro bodybuilder, the ketogenic diet likely doesn’t play much of a role\nHowever, the ketogenic diet could really help somebody like myself, “a former fat kid”, in that it will “help me to continue to tighten up and it will also give me some mental freedom”\nIf you stick with that exact same regimen all the time it tends to become less effective\nSo with a ketogenic diet, you could theoretically become more sensitive to carbohydrates by scripting in a ketogenic diet at certain points and changing up the style of exercise that you do for a while\n\n“I think one of the worst things you can ever do, whether it’s business or any aspect of your life. . . is get stuck in one thing because. . .you’re focused in on that one thing and you can’t see anything else” —Mark Bell\n\nFigure 6. Mark’s total transformation (over 10 years) from powerlifter to bodybuilder. Image credit: Mark Bell (Instagram)\nThe steroid controversy: Mark’s use of them and Peter’s perspective [1:42:15]\nWhat do steroids actually do for you?\n\nMark, who is currently using steroids, says there’s a lot of confusion around this:\n“I think people think that steroids automatically make you strong [but] what they do in most cases is they allow people to gain more weight. Now there’s some cases where people don’t gain a whole lot of weight and they do gain strength. But if you don’t continue to gain weight at some point that strength will only level up so much. So when you introduce steroids, steroids don’t multiply on top of themselves. They only work to a certain level. So you’re on level 1 with your lifting and you progress and your genetics allow you to get to level 4. You take steroids and maybe over a period time it’s like level 6 but you’re still not going to be able to get to level 8, 9 or 10 like guys like Jay Cutler”\nPeter points out that steroids alone do not produce the type of results you see in professional bodybuilders, “[I could inject] the world’s supply of anabolic steroids into me [and I] couldn’t look one-tenth of what [Phil Heath] looks like.”\n\nSteroids in bodybuilding:\n\nStill very much a part of the sport\nEven the different levels, such as “Classic Physique”, is not drug-free\nChris points out that it does kind of “cloud the sport” but this is mainly due to the misconception that the drugs are producing the majority of the results\n\nPeter’s perspective on anabolic steroids:\n\n“Once I really spent like five years learning everything there was to learn about anabolic steroids I came to the conclusion that while I can’t speak to what happens in bodybuilding because I think that takes it to a different level, but certainly within the levels of how they’re used in cycling or you know more physiologic levels of use, I can’t see any evidence of harm.”\nChris points out a scenario where steroids may have caused an injury: he tore his tricep and he thinks he was lifting too heavy because while his muscles were capable, his tendons weren’t capable of handling the load\nBut from the perspective of how it affects your liver, kidney and cardiometabolic health, Peter and Chris agree that there’s little evidence of harm\nThe problem is when people abuse them and don’t understand how to use them properly or within physiologic levels\n\nTestosterone: Peter’s approach to improving it in patients, and the impact of sleep, cortisol, and statins on production [1:51:00]\nPeter says the purpose of increasing testosterone (endogenously or exogenously) is to:\n\nResolve insulin resistance\nPreserve muscle mass\n\nPeter’s approach to diagnosing and improving low testosterone in patients without injecting exogenous testosterone\n\nStarts with the final thing he cares about: free testosterone\nTo be diagnosed with low testosterone, Peter says you have to 2 things:\n\n1. Free testosterone that is one or two standard deviations below the mean, and\n2. Have symptoms, such as trouble maintaining muscle mass, insulin resistant, low libido\n\nIf they meet both criteria, the next question is, “is free testosterone low because testosterone is low, or because sex hormone-binding globulin is high? Because free testosterone, which is what matters, is proportional to testosterone and inversely proportional to sex hormone-binding globulin”\n\nIf sex hormone-binding globulin is high, there are 4 possible reasons:\n\nInsulin\nThyroid hormone\nEstrogen\nGenetics\n\nIf testosterone is low, you try to figure out why:\n\nAre they siphoning too much testosterone into either dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or Estradiol? If yes, you can correct those with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors or aromatase inhibitors\nOr are they simply not producing enough? If yes, which of these is the reason why?\nNot enough Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)\nDon’t have the pituitary signal that your FSH or LH is too low => There are things you can give someone that stimulates LH or FSH production\n\n“There are actually nine steps in understanding someone’s testosterone and free testosterone level and we can actually impact every single one of those steps pharmacologically”\n“But now you’re seeing this stuff published in the medical literature that says, ‘Hey there are really reasonable safe ways to increase a person’s testosterone without even giving them testosterone.’”\nSleep deprivation\nPeter gives an example of a common patient:\n\nLow free testosterone\nEstradiol not too high\nSex hormone-binding globulin not too high\nDHT is not too high\nDHEA is not too low\nHe’s not making enough testosterone, but his FSH and LH are also low\nSo what does this mean? It means that this guy’s brain isn’t making the signal to tell his body to make more testosterone despite the fact that his testosterone is low so that tells you where the problem is the problem is\nThe number one diagnosis for the lack of brain signal is sleep deprivation\n\nHypercortisolemia (high cortisol)\n\nSo if you have too much cortisol you start to “steal” precursors of testosterone to make more cortisol\nPerhaps the more sinister issue is these high levels of cortisol impair you from entering what’s called Delta Wave sleep which is where you make the FSH and LH to make the testosterone\nYou only make this stuff when you’re sleeping\n\nStatins\nIn theory, you could make the argument that when you take a statin it is inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, and given that you need cholesterol to make sex hormones, that should be depleting them\n\nBut we don’t actually see that in the data\nThe body will prioritize its use of cholesterol for two things above all else: 1) forming cellular membranes and 2) hormone production, particularly glucocorticoids and sex hormones\n“At the levels that most people are taking [statins] the evidence would not actually suggest that we’re inhibiting endogenous testosterone production”\n\nFor more on statins, see this episode of The Drive with Dr. Ron Krauss\n“That’s the takeaway to me, a statin, a carbohydrate, or whatever, it’s a tool. And the key to me if you want to be a great carpenter in life. . .is to have the most tools, know how to use each tool, and know when to use each tool.” —Peter Attia\nUpcoming nutrition documentary [2:03:00]\n\nWhat is it about and when is it going to be ready?\n“I don’t know either answer at all. I have no idea. So every film that I do is a journey. I never know when it’s going to end.”\nThe documentary will be loosely based on the world of nutrition and will likely include Mark’s journey into bodybuilding at age 41\nIn general, they are planning for the film to be out “next year”\n\nParting advice from Mark [2:05:00]",

You know almost all of us are lucky enough to have the ability to put one foot in front of the other. Try to go for a 10-minute walk every day. . . do it after lunch, do it after dinner, preferably it’d be great if you can do it more than once a day. But it’s just a great place to start. A great way to clear your mind, there’s a lot of shit going on nowadays. If you have an hour and a half or whatever it might be to be on Instagram all day. You certainly can carve out 10 minutes for yourself every day to go on a walk. Really, really simple easy thing to do.”\nKratom, a powerful plant with the potential to help opioid addiction and more [2:06:15]\nA Leaf of Faith\n\nChris made a film called A Leaf of Faith that explores the kratom plant and its purported benefits including getting people off opioids and relieving pain\nFind it on iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix\n\nMind Bullet\n\nMark and Chris developed a product using kratom called Mind Bullet\nThey use it as a pain reliever, pre-workout, and Mark claims it can even give you some euphoria\nFind it at mindbullet.com\n\nThe many resources and ways to follow Mark and Chris [2:07:45]\nChris:\n\nInstagram: @bigstrongfast\nTwitter: @bigstrongfast\n\nMark’s YouTube channel\n\nMark Bell – Sling Shot\nMark says they spend nearly $250,000 per year on his YouTube channel just to get information out there to arm people with information they need\n\nMark:\n\nInstagram: @marksmellybell\nTwitter: @marksmellybell\nWebsite: markbellslingshot.com (Find his products including the Sling Shot and the Hip Circle)\nPodcast: Mark Bell’s Power Project\nPodcast (ended): Mark Bell’s PowerCast\n\nSuper Training Gym\n\nMark’s gym in Sacramento that is free (if you’re willing to work hard)\nInstagram: @supertraininggym\nFacebook: Super Training Gym\n\n§\n \n",
