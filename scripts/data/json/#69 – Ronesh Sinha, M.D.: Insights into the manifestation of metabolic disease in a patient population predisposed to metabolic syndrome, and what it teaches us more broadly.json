    "content": "In this episode, Dr. Ronesh Sinha, a physician, author, and educator based in Silicon Valley, shares his many insights into metabolic illness that he has gleaned from his South Asian patient population. In this conversation we focus on hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, blood pressure, obesity, etc. and ways to address them with nutrition, sleep, exercise, stress management, and more. We also take a deep dive into insulin resistant phenotypes, evolutionary theory and geographic determinants of insulin resistance which provides insight into the genetic architecture and pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. Additionally, we discuss the surprisingly interrelated topic of stress, and how we might be inadvertently passing this on to our children, leading to mental and physical sickness down the road. \nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#69 - Ronesh Sinha, M.D.: Insights into the manifestation of metabolic disease in a patient population predisposed to metabolic syndrome, and what it teaches us more broadly\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#69 - Ronesh Sinha, M.D.: Insights into the manifestation of metabolic disease in a patient population predisposed to metabolic syndrome, and what it teaches us more broadly\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#69 - Ronesh Sinha, M.D.: Insights into the manifestation of metabolic disease in a patient population predisposed to metabolic syndrome, and what it teaches us more broadly\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t",

It really creates a pretty depressing picture of how individuals age and become depressed later on in life.”\n\nRonesh emphasizes the importance of building stability and strength in his younger patients \n\nPopulation already has smaller leg mass to begin with\nBy the time individuals in the Asian population reach 50-60 years of age, their leg strength is compromised \nHere is a blog post in which Ronesh talks about the importance of strength training, particularly building and maintaining leg muscles, in addition to ethnic differences\nHere is an animation Ronesh uses to help visualize how glucose enters a muscle cell  \n\n\n\n \nLifestyle changes to improve insulin resistance and other metabolic phenotypes [1:14:00]\n“A lot of individuals think stress reduction means that you’re magically going to eliminate external stress…But a certain percent of individuals…get high blood pressure, glucose abnormalities, some sort of chronic health condition as a result of that. So if we can train our system to not be as reactive and responsive to that external stress, that’s really what we’re looking for.”\n\nTo accommodate the schedules of busy professionals, Ronesh tries to integrate strength, mobility and stress management exercises throughout the day \n\nIntroduces apps and tools to measure the number of squats, stretching and balance exercise \nUsing a smart watch, Ronesh teaches breathing exercises to lower blood pressure\nTracking heart rate makes the case that individuals can act in ways to change their own physiology\n\nPeter views mindfulness as a tool that he can apply in his life, in order to respond rather than react\nPeter has observed his glucose levels increase in response to stress\n\n\n\n\nMany of Ronesh’s patients have focused on the diet-exercise axis but not on the importance of stress, sedentary activity and sleep \nMany patients bring in their family members to medical visit, revealing family tension that is cause for stress \n\n⇒ Ronesh summarizes digital tools and techniques for stress reduction in this post\n \nIs PCOS a manifestation of insulin resistance? [1:21:00]\n“When you see all the generational elements, you realize that, well, this is much more challenging than just looking at one individual.”\nRonesh observes insulin resistance in response to stress across different lifespans: from pre-diabetes, coronary heart disease, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\n⇛ Check out Ron’s blog post on root cause, symptoms, and treatment of PCOS\n\nTreatment shifts from treating the individual to address generations of insulin resistance that manifests in different ways\nRonesh does not treat many teenagers but many of his patients have female family members that fit the insulin resistant criteria in the form of PCOS\n\nEndocrinologists in the surrounding Bay Area report seeing 25% to 30% of Asian Indians who probably have some manifestation of PCOS\nRonesh things a better name for the condition is insulin resistant ovarian syndrome rather than polycystic ovarian syndrome \n\n\n\nPCOS is the result of hyperinsulinemia\n\nThe effects of insulin on the ovary Theca cells results in release of testosterone \nThe resulting manifestations have devastating effects (obesity, facial hair, acne, and emotional disorders) on teenage girls \nMany cases have been reversed with lifestyle changes that act to lower insulin \nIGF plays a role but addressing hyperinsulinemia can reverse the condition and its manifestations\n\n \nThe impact on stress on adiposity, and Peter’s treatment regimen for overweight females resistant to typical nutritional approaches [1:23:45]",

The relationship between adiposity, inflammation, insulin resistance and athleroschlerotic vascular disease. Image Credit: (Boden, 2009)\n==> Example: Females Ronesh treats return to India (surrounded by family, likely sleeping better) and lose weight (despite increase in dietary carbohydrate), away from the stress of western life) \n“They’re back to their tribe, their family. They’re probably sleeping better. They’re eating a little bit less processed foods, but more carbohydrates, but they’re just in their native place now. Whereas when they come back here, they’re isolated. They’ve come back from a huge family. They’re here with all the independent stressors of western life and that is just so much more obesogenic. And I’ve seen so many cases that I’m basically convinced that that stress axis is a huge part of obesity.”\n\nAlthough difficult to measure, stress and sleep quality has effects on adiposity and overall health \nSleep efficiency is key\n\nMany devices (Apple watch, Fitbit, WHOOP,  Oura Ring) can measure sleep duration \nThere is a large difference in health metrics between patients that get 6 versus 8 hours on average per night\n\n\n\n==> Example: In his South Asian patients, Ronesh sees a correlation between insulin resistance and sleep apnea \n\nPatients don’t necessarily have a high BMI \nSleep apnea and intermittent hypoxia is an inflammatory stimulus\nWhen sleep apnea is corrected via lifestyle changes or CPAP, glucose numbers decrease\nRonesh hypothesizes that hyperinsulinemia plays a causal role in sleep apnea \n\n \nHow a culture of achievement and expectations can lead to undue stress, unhappiness, and health problems in our children (a Silicon Valley case study) [1:35:00] \n Quote TK “…the way we raise our kids early on might actually set a pattern for how much of an accelerated life or how much of a stressed out nervous system they might have later on. As I’ve talked to more and more families who are in Silicon Valley, I’m realizing that it is a lot of the behavioral patterns that we’re instilling in our kids are kind of setting the foundation for insulin resistance and inflammation early on.” -Ronesh [1:35:45]\n",

As I’ve talked to more and more families who are in Silicon Valley, I’m realizing that it is a lot of the behavioral patterns that we’re instilling in our kids are kind of setting the foundation for insulin resistance and inflammation early on.”\n\nIn his Silicon Valley patient population, Ronesh sees the manifestation of adult health disease early on in life \n\nFrom fatty liver to adult hypertension in teenagers\n\nRonesh does not see a very strong relationship between coronary (heart) disease and elevated LP-a\nAlthough published studies on LP-a suggests that the South Asian population are at risk for elevated LP-a, Ronesh does not observe a correlation\n\nIn fact, he sees plenty of heart disease in South Asians with normal LP-a levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⇛ For more on Lp(a) check out a previous episode of The Drive: Deep Dive: Lp(a) — what every doctor, and the 10-20% of the population at risk, needs to know (EP.07)\n\nFigure 8. Potential mechanisms of FFA induced insulin-resistance and inflammation. Ronesh has observed that his Asian patient population that are not insulin resistant have a hereditary increase plasma FFAs. Image credit: (Boden, 2009)\nHow culture, family dynamics, and parenting styles impact health\n\nRonesh encourages patients to come into treatment with their families (kids), which gives him insight into family dynamics and stressors \nChildren are raised with the concept of “pyramid parenting”: The upcoming generation should exceed the achievement of their parents\n\nOpioid and substance abuse has increased in response to achievement pressures\nRonesh and his wife present a talk that addresses the amount of pressure children are put under \n\n\n\n⇛ Reprogramming a culture: Ronesh and his wife gave a talk to high tech companies and schools called “Is Your Child a Startup?\n\nPeter just read the book: The Coddling of the American Mind … it suggests that the fragility of the Gen I (kids born post 1995) is a result of ridiculous over-the-top political correctness at institutions, helicopter parenting, and overly protective stuff happening\nThis is slightly different variation than what Ronesh is describing which is children being “overly pushed”\n\n“If you think about how we look at our kids, for many individuals, the kids are an extension of their ego.”\nDoes Ron think this is unique to the Silicon Valley or other areas of equal prominence?\n\nIt might be highlighted in Silicon Valley, but he thinks this problem can be found anywhere\n\n⇒ Example: “Snowplow parenting”… Written about in a New York Times article is another phenomenon in which parents create “pseudo profiles” of their children – projecting and creating large goals and aspirations that puts further pressure on children\nRon’s personal experience of being pushed (and pushing his own kids)\n\nRonesh has experienced achievement pressure himself (his immigrant father became a doctor)\nFound himself guilty of pushing his own kids in some cases\n\nPushing kids to do more and achieve more can impact their health\n\nChildren in high school do so much in the day that their sleep and diet becomes compromised\nKids are burned out on exercise for sports that once they leave high school they have no desire to workout for fitness reasons\nParents have scheduled out “play time” so kids are never just allowed time to screw around which can be important for their mental health\n\n*Tips for parents to help their kids better manager stress/be happier in the long run…\n\nHobbies without expectations: Ronesh emphasizes the importance of instilling hobbies for stress reduction later in life\n\nSpecifically, a source of pleasure that is separate from pressure and expectation\nE.g., learning piano at their leisure vs. forcing them to learn piano to get college credits\n\n\nTeach them to avoid too much internal rumination: Teach them how to cognitively reframe situations (and avoid internal rumination)\n\nExample: Ronesh plays Roses and Thorns with his children at the dinner table\nAlso, check out Ron’s detailed post on rumination which explains common thought patterns, especially in high achievers, and how to mitigate their impact\n\n\nAs a parent, express some of your own thoughts and frustrations: Doing this in front of your kids might make them more free and comfortable to open up and tell you relatable stories from their own life\n\n",

It’s kind of like back in the day…where we knew cigarettes were bad for us, but hell, people were smoking anyway…when I really dig down in these family sessions, they always identify the phone as being a major cause of conflict in the family, attention deficit stuff, so many issues.”\nNeurochemistry/dopamine pathways and social comparison\n\nHe speaks to parents about the effect of device use on neurochemistry, dopamine pathways, and how it encourages social comparison (particularly for girls) \n\n⇛  Here (1,2,3) is some of Ronesh’s published work, chronicling effects and recommendations with regards to mental health, parenting and “Silicon Valley Syndrome”\n⇛ For more on the impact of social media on stress levels and health: check out a previous episode of The Drive with Dr. Robert Sapolsky (specifically starting at 1:01:45)\n“…because of this device, they’re going to bed late, they’re having social issues. This is something we need to take seriously”\nTo address the impact that devices can have on health and disease …\n\nRonesh is in the process of creating a non-profit called  DATA (Doctors Against Tech Addiction) in which he could congregate the support of CEOs and entrepreneurs from high tech companies and physicians alike\n\nWays to curb your child’s usage of the device:\n\nIf you have a combative relationship, forcing them to put it down may lead to them wanting it more or using it to rebel\nInstead, it might make more sense to find a replacement for their idle time (e.g., hobbies)\nParents are also guilty so kids may be mirroring the parent’s phone “addiction”\nTry to plan activities without phones (camping, hikes, walks, bike rides, etc.)\nAssociate with other parents who agree with you and are willing to get together in a device free environment\n\n \nHow you can help yourself, your family, and your community without being an MD or PhD [1:55:00]\n\nPeter makes a point to emphasize that people don’t necessarily need a doctor to walk them through making big impacts on their health\nThere are so many resources (books, blogs, podcasts) that can help you improve your own health (stress, sleep, nutrition, etc.)\nRonesh highlights a key point: People can still make a huge impact on the lives of their coworkers, their family, and friends just with the knowledge they’ve gained through the resources that Peter just mentioned\n\n And it’s very rewarding to do so\nAnd you can be an evangelists for health without being an MD or PhD\n\n\n\n“The most gratification is if I have a one-on-one interaction with the human being and I can make an impact on their life. And you don’t need special fancy degrees. Anybody at any stage can do that.” – Ronesh [1:56:45]\nWhere can people follow Ron’s work?\n\nThe best way to reach Ronesh is through his website: https://culturalhealthsolutions.com/ \nYou can send him direct emails as well: dr.ronsinha@southasianhealthsolution.org\nYou can follow him at instagram at roneshsinhamd\n\n",
