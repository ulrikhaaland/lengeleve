You just, kind of, have to react.”\n\nThe challenge of doing business with the US healthcare system\n\nTough challenge for businesses like Dexcom, “because you don’t exactly know, from a long-term planning standpoint, exactly what changes are going to come about.”\nBenefit of a single-payer system (like Canada): the incentive is aligned between the payer, the patient, the provider, over a long term\n\nExample, if you have that 25 year old, and the difference between them have a hemoglobin A1c of 8% vs 6% means nothing in the short run, “but in 20 years, it matters beyond words”\nThere are many downsides as well to the single payer system, and it’s probably unlikely to ever be the implemented in the US\n\n\n\n⇒ Kevin says\n\nThe good news is that “we’re covered by 99% of all reimbursement authorities”\nWhere our coverage is a little spotty still, is in the Medicaid programs\nWhere it gets difficult, is the documentation the patients have to provide, or the physicians have to provide, and consistency of co-pays and things of that nature. \n\n⇒ Peter says,\n\n“We have a really complicated health care system. . .But look, there are some things that I think it does well. And I think one of the things it does well, is it seems to set up an economic engine that allows for an innovation, that I think is hard to do outside of the United States.” \n\nDeveloping an even smaller, more user-friendly, and less costly product while maintaining performance and accuracy [33:15]\nExciting partnership with Verily\n\nVerily is Alphabet Inc.’s (Google) research organization devoted to the study of life sciences\nVerily approached Dexcom about partnering: Dexcom to focus on performance and accuracy while Verily will focus on miniaturization and convenience and what consumers like\nMutually decided it was a great partnership\nSo now they are co-developing future Dexcom sensors (much of the electronic side, communication, Bluetooth, etc. have been driven by the Verily engineers)\n“We focus on performance, patient convenience, and usability, and then taking costs out.”\n\n\nFigure 2.

I know they’re so indebted to our company, and it’s really why we come to work every day, what keeps us going.”\nNext thing on the horizon for type 1 diabetes patients [43:30]\n“The next thing on the horizon for type one diabetes is to develop algorithms to go with the sensor. . . for automated insulin delivery.”\nCurrently, the G6 will tell you…\n\nGlucose value\nThe trend\nThe speed at which you are going up and down\nIt will give you alerts and alarms based on what’s going on\n“But we don’t tell you what to do”\n\nNew partnership with Tandem\n\nTandem has a new insulin pump that has software to read the information from the Dexcom sensor\nThe pump (size of a pager) sits on your body with an insulin cartridge inside\nThe pump will decided to turn your insulin on or off/up or down based on the glucose readings from the Dexcom sensor\nConsumer feedback “has been wonderful”\n\nFuture advancements in the algorithms\n\nIn time, the algorithms will be able to regulate your insulin delivery all throughout the day whether you’re high or you’re low and detect things like meals (he just ate food, lets delivery insulin now)\nJust acquired an existing algorithm that helps with insulin dosing during the night time\nFor those without an insulin pump…\n\nDecision support: “We also think we can take these algorithms and apply them to people who use multiple daily injections as well to develop decision support.”\n\n\n\nCGM can reduce A1C (and incidences of hypoglycemia)\n\nReduced A1C (even if only 8.0 to 7.8 that can make a big difference in long run)\nReduction in incidences of “bad outcomes” like hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia\n\n⇒ Peter says the old thought process was that hypoglycemia was the main thing to worry about even if you needed a higher A1C to avoid hypos (and also that hyperglycemia was not a big deal)\n\n“I think the tide is changing. I think people are understanding that because of how long a person is going to live with type one diabetes, the microvascular complications are real.”\nIt’s now thought that better glycemic control in kids can predict better intellectual performance in school\n\nThe incredible accuracy of the G6, recommended over-the-counter glucose meters, and the unmatched power of CGM to drive behavioral change [48:15]\nStandard deviation\n\nCGM allows Peter to see his standard deviation of his glucose levels which is “another variable that I find very informative.”\nIn his seven day CGM report, he always wants to know the average blood glucose and his standard deviation",

Peter’s 14-day CGM report from 2016.\nThe accuracy of the Dexcom G6\n\nYou are able to calibrate the G6 daily \nPeter is stunned by how accurate the G6 is when he tests it against a finger stick blood meter\nThe reliable nature of the G6 allows for Peter to stop doing their finger sticks which can be incredibly painful (think about those poor young kids having to stick their fingers multiple times per day for their whole life!)\n“Just 14 days of that kind of checking, my fingers are all blue, and they hurt like crazy.”\nThe new algorithms can identify a finger stick that is inaccurate (when trying to calibrate the CGM)\n\n*Tips for finger sticking and recommended over-the-counter blood glucose meter\n\nTip: you can get false readings if you have any food/crumbs on your finger so make sure to wash your hands and use an alcohol pad on your figure before sticking it\nPeter’s recommended meter: OneTouch Ultra\n\nCGM is a driver of behavioral change\n\nPeter believes that the use of a CGM, at the very least, is a powerful driver of behavioral change\n“It is really hard to not pay attention to how activities in your life, mostly food, but not just food, stress” affects your glucose readings.\n\nStress and glucose levels\n\n“It’s amazing what stress can do to your glucose level.” says Peter\nDoing his own measurements, Peter was able to correlate his nighttime cortisol levels to how much glucose level would rise in the morning\nPeter tells patients that fasting glucose is not nearly as helpful as people think it is inside of a reasonably physiologic range\nFasting glucose of 130, that’s a different situation, there’s something going on there\nBut a fasting glucose of 100 instead of being 90 can very easily be explained by cortisol or hepatic glucose output for some other reason that’s not a function of insulin resistance\n\n\nFigure 4. The impact of a stressful dental procedure on Peter’s glucose level: “Had a *fun* dental procedure today at 930 am. Glucose was 83 at start of procedure. Must have been stressful enough to ramp up cortisol production and hepatic glucose output!!.” Image credit: @peterattiamd\nJunk food horror stories\n⇒ Trail mix\n\nPeter loves trail mix when at the airport (comfort food)\nHis glucose will spike to 130+ after eating it\nBut recently he bought a bag at the airport but decided NOT to eat it because of the CGM (he didn’t want to watch that number rise)\n“I promise you if I didn’t have that CGM, I would’ve eaten it.”\n\n⇒ Yogurt covered raisins\n\nKevin once at a huge cup of yogurt covered raisins and his glucose spiked over 200\n“That was my only ever above 200 glucose spike in my life, and it only took 30 minutes.”\nHis body “overshot” his insulin and dropped his glucose down to 70 \n\n\nFigure 5. Peter’s glucose after indulging: “The price of indulgence. Peak glucose was 121 mg/dL. I inhaled a bag of kettle popcorn which prob had biggest impact on glucose.” Image credit: @peterattiamd\nSoftware improvements for type 2 diabetics, and the remarkable benefits of real-time feedback for driving behavioral change [58:15]\n“The real problem in type 2 diabetes is that we have fixated so much on just the glucose and not worrying about how we get there.”\n\nDrugs that increases endogenous insulin production and/or when you use more insulin, you can reduce the glucose and reduce the microvascular complications, but “you do not save lives” \nStill getting cancer/heart disease/dementia at a much higher rate\nThe real challenge in type 2 diabetes is the combination of the hyperglycemia with the hyperinsulinemia\n\nWhat therapies save lives with type 2 diabetes?\n\nMetformin, where you’re actually fixing the glucose side of the equation and not just adding more insulin to the system\nThe SGLT2 inhibitors, these are the things that are getting the glucose out of the system\n",

I think it’s very difficult to curb a person’s behavior when the feedback loop is too long like the weight on the scale, or the blood test that you get at your doctor every six months.”\n\nBuilding software to help type 2 diabetics (and non-diabetics)\n⇒ Example of software improvements…\n\nAn analysis at the end of the day where we complement somebody, “you kept your glucose within range extremely well“\nPrompts from the monitor to help you do better ⇒ “What did you eat for dinner today?” \nIntegrating the CGM data into a food database with photos (i.e. take a picture of the foods you eat)\nThen you can look back and say, “Well, I ate those scrambled eggs this morning, and my glucose values didn’t go up. Maybe scrambled eggs for breakfast is a good thing for me.” \nThen you take a picture of pancakes and the software recognizes them and you get reminded ⇒ “You know, you had pancakes a month ago, and that may not have been the outcome that you’re looking for.”\n\nExercise and stress: the effect of your psychological state\n⇒ Exercise\n\nIt’s not just what you eat, but it’s the physiologic state you are in when you eat it\nIt’s a very different glycemic response if you eat a bowl of pasta after you’ve exercised intensely for 30 minutes versus eating it after having not exercised\n\n⇒ Stress\n\n“It can’t be understated how much higher my glucose levels are when my sleep is crappy.”\nThe correlation between high glucose levels (by proxy high cortisol) and crappy sleep\n\nDexcom vs. the competitors, the less invasive options, and the fundamental problems needing to be solved with CGM technologies [1:07:00]\nHow does Dexcom perform compared to its competitors?\n\nDexcom has studies that they’’ve published comparing Dexcom CGM to other ⇒ “We maintain our performance all the time.”\nPeter has been vocal about this, “it’s not a subtle difference.”\n“We perform extremely well across all the range of glucose in the low and in the high range.”\n\nDo you think that you will be able to maintain performance as the sensor gets smaller and smaller?\n\nOne of Dexcom’s goals is to have a smaller sensor with a shorter needle\nCurrently the needle goes down to the interstitial fluid, but they are testing ones that go even shallower\nBut there are complications of a shorter sensor (What do the membrane layers look like so you can get an extended wear on a 14-day sensor? How’s electrochemical reaction on a longer life sensor if it’s shorter versus the one that we have now?)\nA lot of trial and error while trying to determine what is the best combination of all of these features \n“I think we’ll have a shorter one. Right now, we’re very comfortable with the interstitial fluid.”\n\n⇒ Peter’s take on the pain related to the insertion of the sensor: “Once it’s in there, I don’t actually know the difference between it being in me versus on the skin.”\nWhy can’t this be done optically (i.e. without going into the skin)?

Dexcom CGM display on Apple Watch. Image credit: dexcom.com\nBluetooth technology\n\nG6 can store data and then back load it once it gets within range of your phone\nThat way people can put their phones in another room while they sleep\nThe transmission range of our product, I believe it’s labeled for 20 feet\n“We went with Bluetooth because we didn’t want our patients to have to put the phone close to the device. We wanted the continuous feed. I think there is a place for near-field and it’s quite possible we’d have both chips in a future one.”\n\nExciting collaborations and partnerships\nApple\n\n“Apple has been a wonderful partner for us in getting the device to the iPhone and getting our apps working on Apple Watch.”\n\nVerily/Onduo\n\nPartnership with Verily includes work with a company that they have called Onduo that is focused on type 2 diabetes and specifically developing solutions that could help people make better decisions\nOnduo is helping to develop apps that combine everything they’ve learned about diabetes with a lot of Google technology and they’re in pilot phases with various payers on the type 2 side\n\nUnited Healthcare\n\nDoing a lot of work with United Healthcare on type 2 diabetes\nIn the future with United, planning to develop some prediabetes models as we take this Gen 6 technology out\n\nFuture places for CGM: Hospitals, nutrition apps, general health and wellness, and more [1:27:15]\nPeter asks: Why isn’t the Dexcom CGM in the ICU of all places?\n\n“We tried.”",

If we can get it on everybody and make this affordable and fit within the normal workflow of the hospital, that’s a tremendous market for us.” \n\nGestational diabetes\n\nIt’s crazy that pregnant women aren’t able to take advantage of the CGM\nBut it’s not yet approved for gestational diabetes\nNeed to run a study in gestational diabetes to get that label\nThe CGM as a diagnostic\nThis gets back to hemoglobin A1C and other measures\nOne of the things that we look at is this product, is it diagnostic as well? \nRight now you drink that real sugary drink, glucose goes way high, then it goes way low (an awful swing) \nWhat about a blinded sensor on somebody for a week?\nThen develop the algorithms to see what we can predict with respect to gestational diabetes\nThose are the type of studies that we want to run in the future and the way we like to go about that market\n\nThe health and wellness CGM market\n\nDexcom would like to combine CGM with some of the nutrition apps\nFor example, Weight Watchers app…\n\nIf that had glucose data and you ate your 32 points today but your glucose factor was still high, maybe we take you down to 26\nAnd vice versa\n\n\nCGM can integrate wonderfully (without showing a glucose value that you dose insulin off of)\n\n⇒ Peter thinks glucose values are a much better metric for health than weight loss\n\n“I just think in the end it’s a much better metric for health and I think health matters more than weight.”\n“Weight is correlated with health, but the correlation is not exceptional. It’s reasonable, but it’s so far from great.”\n“And my prediction would be when those trials are done, your average blood glucose, your standard deviation of blood glucose over a three month period is going to tell you infinitely more than whatever the fluctuations were in your weight.”\n\nType of weight matters more than total weight loss\n\nSubcutaneous fat not as “bad” as visceral fat\nAlso, where that fat resides on somebody probably tells us much more about their metabolic health\n\nLessons you learn from wearing a CGM\n“I just don’t see why I wouldn’t want someone to have this information continuously, in real time, every minute of every day, under any physiologic circumstance.” says Peter\n\nWhat you learn is going to alter your behavior\nYou learn other really interesting things:\n\nHow much even exercise can transiently raise your blood glucose, but what the benefits are after the fact ( which is your ability to dispose of glucose goes up significantly)\nFor Peter, he gets about a 30 point spike in a workout, but for the rest of the his average glucose is about 10 points lower\n\n\n\n“It’s it’s so amazing to think that such a simple biomarker as glucose, something we take for granted on every chemistry test we do on patients . . .what the utility of that is when you can have it measured every five minutes.”\nDexcom’s unique company culture [1:34:15]\nDexcom\n\nFairly big public company",

You’ve gotta remain nimble. You’ve got to be willing to fail. You’ve got to be willing to start over. You’ve got to be willing to do what’s right.”\nFor a large company: “Conversely, that big company structure where you have systems and balances and checks to make sure you’re doing the right thing and you start watching dollars more is a different culture.”\nBlending them together: “So we’re mixing those two together. We’re kind of like a mixed family here.”\n\nDexcom’s employees\n\nWhen Kevin started it was about 300 in 2011\nNow they’re up to ~2,500+\n“We have several people with Type 1 diabetes that work here because they can lend us perspective for our patients that we don’t have on our own. So that’s important to us as well. A lot of the things that we learn are through those in-house studies and through that in-house wear process.”\n\nParenting advice from Kevin [1:37:30]\n\nKevin has 5 kids\nOldest is 15 years older than the youngest\nAnd an 8 year gap between number four and five\n\nKevin’s advice to parents:\n\n“We can’t be afraid to let our kids fail.”\n“I once told a coach to cut my son so he would learn something if he wasn’t going to play him.”\n\n“We learn in life as much from our failures as we do our successes. Sometimes we learn more and sometimes they motivate us to be great and motivate us to do great things.”\n\n“But we oftentimes, as parents, shelter our kids so much from that what appears to be traumatic.”\n“We just try and manage and regulate everything so much all the time.”\n“[My first kid] would tell you that I was very tough on him, but I let him carve his own way and it’s a good thing to let him learn.”\n\nLessons learned through failures and success [1:38:45]\n1 Be better prepared in how you deliver your message\n\nKevin was once had a leadership position at a company which he strongly believed needed to shift course if it were going to be successful\nAfter presenting his point of view, it was rejected\nHe put his head down and worked for many more month before presenting again and was rejected again\n\n⇒ Lesson learned from that experience: “Be better prepared in how I give my message.”\n\nI attribute failures like that to me, I don’t blame the others. \nBe more thoughtful, do more research, and be more strategic\n“That was the one time where it felt like I didn’t get done what we could have got completed.”\n\n2 Sometimes the biggest blessings are the little failures along the way\n\n“We’ve all had numerous little failures. Sometimes, again, our failures are our biggest blessings.”\nKevin considers the many job opportunities that he fail to get were learning experiences that allowed him to get the even better opportunity down the road\n\n3 Surround yourself with great people\n“You’re only as good as those people that are around you.”\n\n“And it becomes clearer and clearer to me the longer I work. This team we have here at Dexcom, they are committed, they work hard. We are all engaged in our business each and every day. I never go to a meeting with another company where their people are as engaged in what they do as ours.”\n\n",
