    "content": "Show Notes*Notes from intro:\n\nDr. Mike Gershon is a Professor of Pathology and Cell Biology at Columbia University \nHis research focuses on the neural control of the gastrointestinal tract, and the role of serotonin in the gut as a neurotransmitter\nMike earned his medical degree from Cornell University followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at Oxford\nMike has received numerous awards and honors over the years\nHe has published hundreds of peer reviewed papers on the nervous system\nHe authored a book on the role of the brain and the GI system\nThis episode’s different from a lot of our episodes; truthfully it comes across more as a bit of a med school lecture\n\nIt is really interesting, but I think at the surface it doesn’t really come across as highly applicable\nThe reality of it is you just have to get through some of the embryology, anatomy, and neurophysiology of the gut and the brain to understand how these things coexist\nExpectations‒ if you’re coming into this thinking that this is going to be a podcast that’s about how to eat this and not that and affect your gut biome, it’s really not about that\nThis is a much more basic discussion, and I mean basic not in simple, but I mean basic in more elemental explanation, of how this system works\n\n\nPeter reflects, “Truthfully I learned a lot in this episode, much more than I normally do. A lot of times I go into podcasts knowing the subject matter pretty well, and maybe increasing my knowledge by 20%, or something like that, but I think this was pretty different.” \nRather than give you a blow by blow of everything we talked about here, go into this assuming you’re not going to know much of what we talk about, and you’ll come out of this with a much greater appreciation for how your gut and your brain are connected\n\nWe’re only now beginning to think about how to translate this topic to clinical utility\nWe don’t yet have all of the insights\n\n\nWe hope you don’t come away from this episode saying, “Oh, all you need to do is eat this and your gut’s going to be healthier, and if your gut’s going to be healthier then your brain’s going to be better, or vice versa.” \nThis episode should give you a good foundational knowledge to evaluate half of the snake oil stuff that is out there\n\nPeter feels that most of what’s out there on this topic is utter nonsense\n\nCommercial tests that promise miracles don’t make any sense,\nSimilarly, supplements that don’t make any sense\n\n\nWe hope you’ll come away from this understanding how difficult it is to try to make the claims that are out there\n\n\n\n \nThe basics of the gastrointestinal (GI) system [3:45]\nWhat brought you so much curiosity to study the GI system for 60 years?\n\nMike has been studying the GI for 60 years and there’s still more to study; it’s a very difficult subject\n\n“As the saying goes, the further you get from shore, the deeper the ocean gets”‒ Peter Attia\n\nThere is a lot of fundamental foundational knowledge required to have a basic understanding before we can get into the nuanced stuff around the GI system\nIt makes sense to start with some of the basics of the human GI including its embryology, anatomy, vascular supply, and ultimately we’re going to want to talk about its connection to the nervous system, which is quite distinct and unique (relative to even the peripheral nervous system)\n\nCharacteristics of the GI tract and its function\n\nThe GI system is basically a tube that begins at the mouth and ends at the anus\nIt’s hollow so the inside of the GI tract is really an internalized external space; it’s outside the body\n\nIf you bleed into your GI tract, you lose blood (even if you can’t see it)\n\nThis is one of the major crises in medicine‒ hidden bleeding in the GI tract\nIt can be very damaging, even if you don’t see any blood\n\n\n\n\nThe inside of your gut is outside of your body, and it provides a space for a community of extra organisms to live\n\nThis space is immense\nThis space can be dangerous and a barrier is necessary to keep it separate from the rest of you\n\nThis barrier is defended by the body\n\n\nIt also allows food to be digested and absorbed\nIt has to maintain the communication with the lumen, which is what we call the inside of the GI tract\n\n\n\nThere is a balance in the GI between protection of the body and allowing food stuff to come in\n\nPeople understand that many bacteria colonize our nasal passages, skin, etc.\nAnd that when bacteria enter the body, bacteremia is a bad thing\nThe GI tract has unique challenges because it must allow transmission of nutrients across its surface but not allow bacteria/ organisms to go through\nFurther, the food we eat is not ready for absorption\n\nFood has to be digested\n\n\nNot only does the gut have to absorb a variety of things, it does so in an awful witches brew that breaks down the food\n\nAll without digesting yourself\n\n\n\n“The lining of the gut is absolutely remarkable”‒ Michael Gershon\n\nComplex molecules that are not sterile are entering a non-sterile environment and somehow only sterile nutritional building blocks are allowed to cross the border of the GI tract\n\n \nThe very early development of the GI system [9:30]\n\nDuring development the body forms a flat disc\nThat disc undergoes a series of folds from head to toe, and from side to side, and the lateral or side folding produces the tube from which the gut forms\n\nSo the flat disc folds around to create an internal space, and that tube because the gut\nThis takes place during the 1st trimester\n\nThe gut is fully developed between the 2nd and 3rd trimester\n\n\n\n\nThe first part of development is called embryogenesis\n\nThat is the fertilized egg forms the disc, the disc folds, the organs of the body form, and that’s the embryonic period\n\n\nThe fetal period follows \nThe fetal period models the organs into their appropriate developmental form so that they becomes functional enough to support a baby\nPeter recalls from med school (26 years ago), that fold turns into the tube which will become the entire length of the GI system, and there are also these little outpouchings that come along later \n\nThese become things like the pancreas and the bile duct, etc. which form other things that drain into the GI system and perform essential functions for digestion\nFor example, the pancreas and gallbladder drain into the gut\nThe lungs are also formed, and they do not drain into the GI system\nThe liver has a component that drains into the gut through the bile system\n\n\nThe foregut forms the stomach, the first part of the small intestine, the lungs, the pharynx, pancreas, gallbladder\nThe midgut is the business of small intestine and the first part of the large intestine\nThe hindgut is the end of the large intestine\nPeter recalls that the foregut, midgut, hindgut basically tracked with the three vessels coming off the aorta‒ the celiac, the superior and inferior mesenteric\n\n \nThe unique properties of the blood supply and portal system in the GI tract [12:45]\n\nThe foregut is defined as the part of the gut from the celiac artery\nThe celiac artery is the most rostral, or anterior (closest to the head), see the figure below\n\n\nFigure 1.  Blood supply to the GI tract and anatomy of the colon.   Image credit: GrepMed.com\n\nThe celiac artery supplies the pancreas, the stomach, the first part of the duodenum, and the liver and the gallbladder\nThe superior mesenteric artery supplies the midgut\n\nThat’s the longest part of the gut\nThat goes roughly to the mid-transverse colon\n\n\nThe colon has 3 parts, it folds\n\n1 – It has an ascending colon\n2 – A transverse colon going sideways\n3 – A descending colon, which goes down to the rectum and anus, which is out\n\n\nThe inferior mesenteric artery supplies the end of the gut \nWhen the celiac gives rise to the stomach and first part of the small intestines arterial supply (that then breaks into capillaries, absorbs materials from the gut), those capillaries drain into veins in the gut\n\nAnd in a unique way, those veins then form large vessels which then move into the liver\nThey then break into capillaries, small vessels within the liver called sinusoids\nSo the venous system that supplies the liver is actually acting as if it were an artery, but it begins in the gut\n\n\nSo the liver depends on this venous system for its oxygen on blood that the gut has had a first crack at\n\nAnd to keep the liver going, it gets a 2nd arterial supply from the hepatic artery  \n Basically the liver is perfused with blood coming from the gut \n\nAnd when it’s about to asphyxiate, a sphincter shuts that down, opens up, and it gets a breath of fresh blood (and gets some oxygen), and then it goes back to dealing with what it gets from the gut\n\n\n The reason it does that is the liver is the first step in the body’s ability to use the nutrients that the gut absorbs \n\nSo when the gut absorbs fatty acids, the liver turns them into chylomicrons, which can go out and supply energy to the body\n\n\nThe liver is a major center of metabolism working on products from the gut\n\nSo it gets the first crack at what the gut has absorbed\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAn overview of gut anatomy and innervation [16:30]\nHow is the gut innervated?\n\nThe nervous system of the gut is complex and different\n\nThis includes the enteric nervous system and gut-brain axis  \n\n\nThe gut has its own intrinsic nervous system, and Mike has called that “The Second Brain” (that’s the title of his book)\n\n The reason he calls it “The Second Brain” is that like the brain in the head, the nervous system of the gut is able to function and control reflexes and behavior independently of any influence from the brain or spinal cord \n\n\nSo it’s the only nervous system of the body that can work on its own, so if you completely isolate the gut from the brain and the spinal cord, it will function; you’re not dead\nYears ago, when peptic ulcers were thought to be psychogenic, surgeons used to cut the vagus nerves, which are the major conduits that connect the brain and the gut\n\nAfterward, the gut continued to soldier on\nThis never did all that much to fix peptic ulcer disease; that turned out to be caused by infection with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori \n\n\nBefore the discovery of Helicobacter pylori, it was believed that stress was driving peptic ulcer disease\n\nThe idea was that the central nervous system would communicate the stress to the gut via the vagus nerve\nThis wasn’t all wrong, the central nervous system can communicate stress to the gut via the vagus term, but that was not the cause of peptic ulcer disease\n\n\nThis treatment did help to show that the gut could in fact be cut off from the brain and still work \n\nA history of observation of the connections between the brain and gut\n“The nervous system of the gut has been known to be present for a long time”‒ Michael Gershon\n\nIt was discovered about the time of the American Civil War; Auerbach in Germany noticed the extremely large nervous system in the human gut at that time\nAt the turn of the 20th century in the cold laboratories of England, Bayliss and Starling cut all the nerves to the intestine of a dog\n\nStarling is responsible for Starling curves in cardiac physiology\n\n\nWhen they cut all the nerves to the gut and then increased pressure inside the gut in the lumen, the gut would respond with the stereotypic behavior of oral contraction anal relaxation that they called the law of the intestine \n17 years later, during WWI another German scientist by the name of Trendelenburg made important findings\n\nHe experimented with Guinea pig intestine in vitro (on a J-shaped tube)\n\nWhen he blew into the J-shaped tube, it raised the pressure inside the intestine, and the gut blew back at him\nThis was a very profound observation because it showed that with nothing there but the gut the gut could respond, sense the pressure, and show a coordinated wave of activity in response to it\n\n\n\n\n\nThis indicated that the intestinal nervous system is able to function independently of the CNS (central nervous system); no other nervous system outside the CNS can do that (even the spinal cord can’t do that) \n\nThis is a universal finding preserved across species; all vertebrates have it\n\nIt begins with a little organism called amphioxus, which undergoes metamorphosis, turns into a vertebrate\nIt gets more complex as vertebrates become more complex\n\nA fish has only 1 layer of enteric nervous system, humans have 2 (some people would say 3)\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to anatomy of the GI\n\nWhen you go from the lumen (see the diagram below) at the very inside all the way out you have a mucosal layer, a submucosa, and a muscular layer\n\n\nFigure 2.  Structure of the gut wall.  Image credit: Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe lining of the gut is called the mucosa\n\nIt has a superficial lining that is in contact with the lumen called an epithelium\n\n",

it allows the gut to be used to suture material; it’s tough, you can’t pull it out\n\n\nThe next layer is a circular layer of smooth muscle, another layer of smooth muscle, a second one called the longitudinal layer \nThen, if it’s in the peritoneal cavity, there is another layer of very thin epithelium\nThe major parts of the nervous system of the gut are the submucosal plexus (the Meissner’s plexus); that’s in that dense layer of connective tissue, and that’s the smaller of the 2\nThe larger one is the myenteric plexus, and that is in between the two layers of smooth muscle on the outside of the gut\nThe 2 plexuses communicate with one another; they get input from the CNS, and speak back to the CNS\n Although they can function independently of control by the brain, in practice they don’t \n\nThere is a constant 2-way (bipolar) communication between the brain the the gut\nThe  brain acts very much like a CEO; it gives general commands\nThe detail of what the gut actually does, that behavior, is controlled by the bowel itself\n\n\n\nPeter’s summary of these 2 muscular walls \n\n1 of them runs longitudinally; it runs in the direction of the lumen\n1 of the runs orthogonal to that; it runs circularly\nHe remembers from anatomy was that you have these things where if the circular inner layer contracts, that shrinks the lumen\nThen, as the the longitudinal one contracts, it shortens it along its long axis\nTogether this is what permits this remarkable peristaltic rhythmic contraction of the gut\n\n“The behavior of the gut is not so simple as to have just one peristaltic movement”‒ Michael Gershon\n\nWhen you look at it it seems to be moving rhythmically, but it’s much more complicated than that\n\nIt doesn’t do that all the time\n\n\n\nThe first part of the enteric nervous system, which is the myenteric plexus, sits between those two layers \nNext there is the the submucosal plexus \n\nThis is beneath those muscular layers\nIt’s in the tough, submucosal layer\nIt’s between that circular muscular wall and the submucosa\n\nInside the submucosa you have the mucosa, and then ultimately the lumen on the very inside with the enterocytes that form the endothelial lining of the gut \n \nTurnover of the epithelial lining and why cancer rarely develops in the small intestine [26:45]\nWhat is the turnover time of this epithelial layer?  What is the median residence time of an epithelial cell in the gut?\n\nThis depends on the type of epithelial cell\nThe gut epithelium turns over about once a week\n\nEnterocytes turn over very rapidly\n\n\nTo get into the details, there are certain cells in the lining of the gut, such as a cell called the Paneth cell, which lives for 3 weeks\n\nThey are in the base of the crypt; it’s a part of the folding of the lining of the gut\nThe Paneth cell has 2 major functions\n\n1 – Defense, it puts out a number of antibacterial proteins that keep the lining of the small intestine close to sterile (only a few thousand microorganisms for cubic milliliter)\n2 – Nurse the stem cells responsible for turn over of all the cells\nThese cells are not found in the large intestine\n\n\n\n\nGut endocrine cells live a little bit longer\n\nThey produce hormones in the lining of the gut\n\n\n\nWith this rapid turnover of cells, why is it that cancer almost never develops in the small intestine?\n\nThe colon is so susceptible to neoplasia (the formation of cancer), because it has at its surface a cell that is constantly turning over\n\nAs a result, there are more chances for genetic errors of replication that can produce oncogenic mutations \n\n\nPeople have speculated on this\nPart of the answer is the huge microbiome of the large intestine\n\nIt is orders of magnitude larger than that of the small intestine\n\n\nAnother part of it is that the products that sit in the lumen of the large intestine sit there for much, much longer\n\nFood goes through the small intestine, and is digested quickly\nIn terms of being exposed to environmental toxins, or toxins produced by organisms, or toxins that are split off from what you eat, the large intestine is exposed much longer\n\n\n\n \nNutrient and water absorption in the small and large intestine [30:30]\nIs it correct to say that most nutrient absorption takes place in the small intestine and the large intestine mainly reabsorbs water?\n\nYes, but it’s not this simple\nThe large intestine conserves/ absorbs sodium and secretes potassium\n\nWater follows sodium as it comes back into the body\nThe colon acquired this function to enable organisms to live on land\nWhen organisms lived in the water, conserving sodium and water was not such a problem\n\n\nHowever, the bulk of the water that the gut absorbs is not in the large intestine; it’s done in the small intestine\n\nBut the final 100 mL+ of water absorbed happens in the colon; it’s important in maintaining the body’s fluid content\nIf you lose this fluid (as happens with cholera), you can die of dehydration in about 4 hours\n\n\n\nTangent on what can be learned from fluid loss in the large intestine due to cholera\n\nThe cholera toxin turns sodium absorption into chloride secretion, causing water to flow out \nAround 3 million people get cholera each year, resulting in 21,000-143,000 deaths (primarily in Africa and Asia)\n\nThere have been major outbreaks of cholera along the coast of Peru that led to cases a for north at New Jersey, transmitted as people ate contaminated crab\nHati is the most famous large outbreak; it occurred after an earthquake destroyed a lot of their infrastructure\n\n\nCholera is a simple illness, all one has to do is keep track of the water\n\nPatients are put on what’s called a cholera cot; it has a gurney hole in the middle for the anus to be positioned over, and a bucket is put under it\nThe nurse puts a ruler into that bucket periodically to see how much fluid is coming out\nThis fluid is replaced intravenously and orally\nA great life saving discovery was that although cholera blocked the absorption of sodium, it does not block the absorption of glucose in the small intestine\n\nAnd so adding a little bit of sugar to the fluid used for oral rehydration has saved countless lives\n\n\n\n\nAntibiotics have no use in treating cholera\nGiven enough time, the immune system will fight off the bacteria\nSupporting the hydration status of those infected buys them enough time for the immune system to clear infection\n\n \nWays in which the gut and brain communicate [34:30]\nYou made a point to talk about the intrinsic innervation of the gut.  What is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic neurons in the context of the gut?\n\nThe intrinsic nervous system of the gut is a term representing the nerve cells that live within the gut; there are 2 plexuses\n\n\nThe extrinsic innervation includes the brain (which sends fibers to those neurons) and the sympathetic nervous system (which projects from outside the gut into it)\n\nIt also includes the spinal cord and the ganglia associated with the spinal cord\nIt includes sensory ganglia and dorsal root ganglia (which provide a sensory innervation of the gut) \n\n\nIntrinsic means that the cell body of the nerve cell resides within the gut\nExtrinsic means that the cell body is outside the gut, wherever\n\nEveryone can appreciate the incredible pain that one experiences with distention of the bowel.  How is the pain of distention in the gut communicated to the brain?\n\nWhen Peter practiced as a general surgeon, patients presenting with a bowel obstruction were in as much pain as those with a bowel perforation\nIt’s important to be able to put a nasogastric into them and decompress them\nEven if you haven’t had a bowel obstruction, simply being bloated can be incredibly uncomfortable\n\n“The only way the gut feels pain is in response to dilatation or pressure”‒ Michael Gershon\n\nOne can cut the inside of the gut with impunity; surgeons do this all the time when they take biopsies from inside the gut without anesthesia\n\nFrom the point of view of pain, the gut is innervated differently from the skin\nThe skin feels pressure but this is much less painful than cutting; for the gut, the reverse is true\n\n\nIn the gut, most of the fibers that get excited by increased pressure are located in the dorsal root ganglia (hose are pain fibers)\nThe vagus nerve relays some pain, but not much\n\nMostly the vagus nerve carries information back to the brain that has to do with homeostasis\n\n\n\nGive an example of the type of information conveyed by the CNS to the gut\n\nEarlier the CNS was described as functioning like a CEO, providing broad instruction but not necessarily minutia-driven, operational instructions\nCompare this to a scientist submitting a grant to the NIH to obtain funding for their research\n\nThe scientist submits a grant application; they present their research in the best possible light\nThe grant undergoes peer review and the government decides whether to fund it or not\nWhile the scientist waits to hear back from the peer review process, he becomes acutely aware of the effect the CNS can have on their gut\n\nMost people can resonate with this feeling of butterflies, this feeling of tension-induced diarrhea\nThis is coming by way of the CNS\n\n\nSimilarly, some people when they’re frightened or traveling just completely lose the ability to defecate; they become constipated\nSympathetic nerves can slow the gut and make it less likely to defecate\n\nThis occurs in response to true fright (as opposed to anxiety)\nFor example, if you’re fleeing a foxhole because the enemy is coming, it’s best if you don’t have to stop to defecate \n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the gut receive this message at the local level?\n\nIn the CNS, the sympathetic and parasympathetic system communicates that via acetylcholine and things like that\n\nUsing the example of anxiety-induced diarrhea, what happens in the gut? \n\nThe action taken by the gut is more rapid peristalsis and less absorption\nThis is due to the function of the enteric nervous system\nOne theory (that Mike believes) is that command neurons in the gut receive input from the CNS\n\nIt turns out that the number of fibers in the vagus nerve that are running to the gut are pretty small in humans, an estimated 3,000 – 5,000\nThe number of nerve cells within the gut are over 100 million\nSo the intrinsics outnumber the extrinsics by 3 orders of magnitude, if not more\nThat raises the question, how do these nerve cells control it?\nThe CNS, as a CEO uses the command nerve cells to get the reflexes going and keep things moving more rapidly\n\n\nThe gut has a number of different behaviors; it’s not just propelling all the time\n\nIf the gut were constantly propelling (as he described it with oral contraction, anal relaxation, as it’s capable of doing), then social discourse of the kind we’re having right now would become impossible\nSometimes the gut has to stop\n\n\n1 type of behavior in the gut is essentially paresis, the gut stops moving \nA 2nd type of behavior that the gut shows is mixing, where things go back and forth without propulsion\n\nThis is important for mixing the enzymes needed for digestion with food\nAnd anyone who’s ever taken an organic chemistry lab will tell you nothing very much happens unless the reaction is stirred\n\n\nThe gut is able to sense what is going on, when digestion  has occurred sufficiently, and it stops mixing and propels the contents on\nAt night while you’re sleeping, a cleaning process going on in the gut\n\nA wave begins in the stomach; it goes down the small intestine; it proceeds down the large intestines; and it cleans the gut out\nSphincters are opened so things that would ordinarily be too big to pass are allowed through\n\nFor example when a kid swallows a dime or even an open safety pin‒ it manages to get propelled all the way with the small end wons and almost never gets stuck\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe gut’s role in the regulation of appetite [43:30]\nWhat happens between the gut and the brain to control appetite (in the nonpathologic state)?\n\nThere are a number of factors\n1 – Distension of the stomach tends to cause satiety and decrease the urge to eat\n2 – Rise of blood glucose is sensed by receptors within the gut which send signals to the brain \n\nOther cells in the brain are chemo sensitive and detect nutrients within the gut\n\n\n3 – Enteroendocrine cells within the gut make hormones\n\nSuch as cholecystokinin, which can signal to the brain by going through the blood brain barrier to be received by neurons\nLeptin is made within the gut. \nThere are a large number of hormone receptors in the brain that can trigger your urge to eat, as well as nutrients that you absorb, and distension of the bowel itself\n\n\n",

    "content": "\n“The gut has receptors in it and the brain has signals within it that trigger the urge to eat”‒ Michael Gershon\nPeter’s summary: the 2 mechanisms through which appetite is communicated are mechanical and chemical\n\n\n\nMechanical communication occurs in the stomach and to a lesser extent in the small bowel\n\nInformation is transmitted from the gut to the CNS via the vagus nerve\n\n\nThe change in blood glucose is sensed directly in the CNS\n\nThis occurs because glucose easily passes through the blood brain barrier; so the gut doesn’t need to be involved\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood vessels that provide blood to the brain have transporters that allow certain chemicals from the gut, such as leptin and cholecystokinin to be transported so that they can affect the CNS directly\n\n\nGhrelin is another hormone from the gut that works in the opposite way what we’ve been talking about\n\nInstead of decreasing food absorption, ghrelin is a gut hormone that promotes appetite\n\n\n\nWhat causes secretion of ghrelin?\n\nGhrelin secretion is affected by certain chemicals in foods eaten\nNutrients that suppress ghrelin secretion include amino acids and fatty acids\n The natural state is secretion of ghrelin and it’s the presence of nutrients that turn it down\n\nGhrelin is secreted at a constant rate that can be turned up or down\nInhibiting secretion is important to prevent the development of the ghrelin effect\n\n\n\nHow is secretion of ghrelin affected by the type of meal? \n\nRudy Leibel and Mike Rosenbaum have done a number of these experiments comparing mixed-meal-shakes versus solid food\n\nIs satiety affected purely through change in the speed of absorption or are there other differences between a liquid and solid meal that might factor into that? \n\nThere are a number of factors\nThe rate at which the stomach empties varies tremendously depending on what you put into it\n\nFor example, if you just eat a saline meal, the stomach will empty much more rapidly than if there’s protein in it\nAnd even protein will empty much more rapidly than if there’s fat in it\n\n\n\n\nSolids also delay gastric emptying; particles can’t get through the pyloric sphincter unless they’re ground down to a millimeter or less in diameter\n\nOne part of the stomach contracts massively and suddenly, this forces the bolus that’s in the stomach up against the pyloric sphincter (which is the exit of the stomach, and is shut tight); and this ramming action breaks up solids into small particles\n\n\n\nSo the stomach senses the nutrients and the speed at which it empties, regulates the dilatation of the stomach and the signal that the stomach is sending back to urge satiety on the brain, which means that if you’re eating protein and fat, you will reach satiety much sooner than if you’re eating just salt and sugar\nMain takeaway: anything that slows the emptying of the stomach will tend to induce satiety and reduce the length of time during which you feel hungry and want to eat\n \nThe impact of gastric bypass surgery on satiety signals [51:15]\nWhat happens during a gastric bypass and what benefits does it provide?\n\nOne of the most successful operations for the treatment of both obesity and Type 2 diabetes is a gastric bypass\n\nThis reroutes the upper GI tract\n\n\n\nThe gastric bypass triggers an emergency procedure in the small intestine to produce a larger satiety signal \n\nPeople can ignore signals from the stomach when they overeat\nSignals from the small intestine act as a back up signal to stop eating; it makes eating objectionable  \n\n“What the gastric bypass is doing is to make eating so objectionable that it stops sooner and you eat much, much less”‒ Michael Gershon\n\nAnother way to do this is to put a band on the stomach and interfere with the process of grinding the food won; this allows large particles to move into the small intestine and the same thing happens (signals to stop eating are released)\nPeter notes, “that would explain why both of these procedures can fail if a patient continues to consume very high calorie liquids… which includes alcohol”\n\n“One of the things I always say to people that are trying to lose weight is try not to drink any calories”‒ Peter Attia\n \nHow varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can infect neurons in the gut and create issues later in life [54:30]\n\n30 years ago or so, Mike and his wife discovered that the gut is a source of infection by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (the virus of chickenpox and shingles)\nShingles of the gut can occur; that can be very, very serious\n\nA primer on how VZV remains latent to cause shingles after causing chickenpox\n\nAfter someone recovers from the chickenpox, VZV remains in the body (sleeping)\nWhen you get chickenpox, you clear the virus and it forms what is known as an episome in neurons and just sits there latent without causing infection for years and years and years\n\nIt just stays with you for life\n\n\nThen, for reasons that are unknown, the virus can reactivate\n\nThis gives rise to the reemergence of active virus, shown in the diagram below\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.  VZV establishes latency in ganglionic neurons after resolution of chickenpox (varicella) and can reemerge to cause shingles (zoster).  Image credit: Nature Reviews Disease Primers 2015\n\nReactivation (reemergence) of VZV always starts in a nerve cell\n\nBecause it’s been latent in a nerve cell\nDuring reactivation, the virus goes down the axon (or the process from the dorsal root ganglia) to the skin and causes a rash, shown in the previous figure\nBecause of immunity to the virus, it stays localized there in the nerve and skin and doesn’t cause systemic disease like the chickenpox\n\n\nReactivation is called shingles (or zoster); this can be extremely painful because the nerve cells die and become extremely active (they’re pain nerve cells)\nAbout 15% of people develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) where the pain persists for years and is very difficult to treat\n\nThis is pathological pain and the virus isn’t there\nThe nerve cells are no longer causing the pain; it’s coming from within the CNS\nIt’s sort of like a phantom limb in which you cut off a limb and people have the feeling the limb is still there, but it’s not\n Some drugs that do some good like Gabapentin, but nothing is wonderful\n\n\nWhen Peter was a kid, everyone got chickenpox\nKids now get vaccinated for chickenpox\nMike’s wife Anne developed the vaccine\n\nPeter’s takeaway:  Despite how the virus comes into you (through natural infection and immunity of vaccine-induced immunity), it remains latent in the dorsal root ganglion\nWhy doesn’t the immune system completely eradicate it like it does virtually every other virus we encounter?\n\nWhen the virus is in the nerve cells, the immune system can’t see it\n\n“Let’s call it a sequestered virus and it sits as a piece of DNA inside of your body”‒ Michael Gershon\n\nYour immune system can’t see it because it’s not expressed on the surface of the nerve cells that have it\nThe immune system has a very good look at it when it reemerges\n\nIt attacks it and kills the cells in which it reemerges\nEven still, pain can continue in a small number of people\n\n\nMike has discovered that the enteric nervous system can be infected by VZV when you have chicken pox or when you get the live virus vaccine\n\nIt can establish latency within the intrinsic nervous system of the gut, in the enteric nervous system\n\n\nWhen the virus re-arises, even if it gets killed by the immune system, it’s killing nerve cells\n\nThis leads to diseases such as pseudo-obstruction in which the gut loses the ability to work and just becomes totally paralyzed\nOr if the virus emerges and gets into the mucosa, the gut can perforate\nThis has just been discovered, so the frequency of this is unknown\nHe’s just published on its reemergence in the esophagus, where it causes a disease called achalasia\n\nIn this disease the ability of the esophagus to deliver food to the stomach is lost\n The esophagus can’t open, so you can’t swallow at all\nThis only occurs during reemergence, not during the primary infection\n\n\n\n\nThe causes of viral reemergence is not well understood\n\nA weakened immune system is part of it, and this gets us to aging\n\n\n\nIt seems likely that the virus keeps reactivating periodically throughout your life; and that when you have shingles, just exceed a threshold because the immune system has receded just enough to let it out, to reach the clinical threshold \n\nThe current vaccine (Shingrix) [for shingles/ zoster] is 2 shots separated by 6 months\n\nMike remarks, “That has been a giant leap forward. That’s been amazing.”\nThe purpose is to prime the immune system to the virus again, so it can catch the virus more quickly if it escaped\nIt’s about 97% effective, a remarkable vaccine\n\n\nPeter comments that he got his Shingrix vaccine early (he’s not quite 50 yet) and “what a kick in the chops that vaccine is. That makes you sick. I’ve had my first shot. I’m dreading my second.” \n\nMichael points out, “The older you are when you get it, the less likely you are to be bothered by the injection.”\n\n\n\n \nThe relationship between autism and gastrointestinal illness [1:02:45]\nDo children with autism have an increased severity of illness and increased prevalence of gastrointestinal illness? \n\nYes, this is an accepted observation\nAutism is a disease that probably involves synaptic transmission\nIt occurs in the CNS\n\nThe behavioral effects are well known\n\n\nIt also occurs in the enteric nervous system\n\nThere is a smaller effect on the GI tract‒ often diarrhea and sometimes constipation\n\n\n\nAre there a higher degree of food sensitivities and allergies?\n\nThis is not well understood but seems to be related to activation of mast cells\nPeter notes that many parents of autistic children are convinced that if they pay more attention to what their kids eat, they can reduce the severity of their symptoms\n\n Is this a reasonable idea given the simple observation of this association? \n\nMichael points out, “there’s no regularity to the symptoms that you can point to. It’s hard to back it up. And people have been unable to produce any sort of rigorous background for that, so that when you put controls and constant observation, you just can’t document it.” \nPeter replies that there must be so much variability; you need an empirical approach because no one size fits all here\n\nTangent to discuss fraudulent studies by Andrew Wakefield\n\nMike further points out that this area is fraught with poor quality research; in 1991 the British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield published….\n\nPeter discussed this example with Brian Deer,  #158 – Brian Deer: A tale of scientific fraud—exposing Andrew Wakefield and the origin of the belief that vaccines cause autism\n\n\nWakefield associated autism with GI inflammation\n\nThe idea was that if you ate gluten, you could produce endorphins from what you were eating\n\nYou would eat an opiate-like material, then magically the enzymes of the digestive tract would liberate opiate-like products\nThese opiate-like substances would be absorbed and affect the immature, developing nervous system and cause autism\n This is not true \n\n\nHis idea was that if you got the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), it would cause a defect in the gut that could lead to absorption of these opiate-like products\n\n This was also incorrect \n\n\nMike explains, “You can’t train an enzyme to cut something differently than the way the genes have programmed it to” \n\nTrypsin looks for particular amino acids and cuts proteins there; it doesn’t care what kind of endorphin is sitting somewhere else\nThen when peptides are produced, they are not absorbed; only amino acids are absorbed (maybe dipeptides or tripeptides)\nAmino acids are the building blocks of peptides and proteins, shown in the figure below  \n\nAn amino acid is the smallest functional unit or building block that is strung together to make up peptides and proteins\nA peptide is made of less than 50 amino acids\nFor example, a small peptide of 9-11 amino acids is what the immune system recognizes\nA protein is made up of more amino acids, thousands can be linked together in a complex protein\n\n\n\n\nPeter clarifies, in the GI tract only single amino acids or maybe 2 amino acids joined are absorbed\n\nThis is smaller than an immunogenic peptide (what the immune system recognizes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.  Comparison of amino acids, peptides, and proteins (from small to large).  Image credit: Peptide Sciences 2019\n\nMike continues with Wakefield’s flawed logic, if by some miracle these peptides got absorbed, they couldn’t pass through the blood brain barrier\n\nIn fact, they wouldn’t go past the liver\n\n\nMike testified in Congress on this subject\n",

Do they impact the gut specifically? \n\nSSRIs prevent the reuptake of serotonin, this neurotransmitter in the brain, presumably leaving more of it around to exert positive effects\n\nThey’re used to treat the symptoms of depression\n\n\n\n\nThey tend to cause nausea by enhancing the ability of serotonin to talk back to the brain\n\nSimilarly, drugs that are used in cancer chemotherapy also trigger the release of serotonin within the gut and trigger that reflex\n\n\nSSRIs also first make the gut go a little bit faster\n\nBut then when the gut keeps doing that, the receptors, that is the molecules upon which serotonin acts, desensitize\n\nOne way they do that is to internalize\nThey can actually block the effect of serotonin in transit\n\n\nIn terms of motility, they can make the gut go faster\nUltimately, they stop the gut and give rise to long term constipation, and have to be stopped\nThey are nauseating, they change motility\n\n\nDuring development, if you give SSRIs to a mouse during fetal development (give it to the mother during fetal development), you get an abnormal nervous system grown in the mouse’s nervous system \n\nAre SSRIs contraindicated in pregnancy?\n\nThey are used frequently and in large numbers, large amounts in pregnancy because pregnancy is very often associated with depression\nFortunately, they are most commonly used postpartum\n\nBut even then it’s a problem because SSRIs can be communicated to the child in breast milk\n\n\nThere is evidence that a number of conditions are increased in the offspring of mothers who are treated with SSRIs during pregnancy\n\nSuch as irritable bowel syndrome \n\n\nPeople worry about this, but depression is potentially lethal and if you have something to treat it; sometimes you have to use it\n\nDo alternatives have the same effect?  \n\nSNRIs (Serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) can be efficacious \nThey do have some of the same effects, but SNRIs are less selective for serotonin\n\nAdditionally they target norepinephrine, and that doesn’t get you anywhere\n\n\n\n \nDefining “leaky gut” and its most common causes [1:16:45]\n\nConsider the context of the enterocytes\n\nOn the luminal side, they have a never ending barrage of  toxins, microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, food stuff that have to be absorbed\nAt the same time, they can’t be digested by these things\n\n\n\nHow do tight junctions fit into this picture? \n\nEpithelia are the cells that line cavities\nEpithelia have 3 types of junctions that hold the cells together\n\n1 – Desmosome, or a spot weld, is just very tenacious\n\nIt’s hard to pull out this connection between cells \n\n\n2 – Tight junctions have protein in the membrane on one cell that forms an attraction to the membrane across the cell transmembrane, and it obliterates the space between 2 cells\n\nThe function of tight junctions are to prevent material going through the channel between two epithelial cells\n It’s a plug in the bathtub \n\n\n3 –  Adhesion junctions are essentially like the spot weld, but are also is contractile, \n\n\nTight junctions are what we’re talking about with leaky gut (shown in the figure below)\n\n\nFigure 5. Characteristics of a leaky gut.  Image credit: sydneygp.com.au \n\nThe more of these tight junctions you have between 2 epithelial cells, the less leaky or permeable that connection is between them \n\nAnything that interferes with the tight junctions can make the channel open and allow material from the lumen to get into the body, but at the same time, allow material within the body to get into the lumen\n\n\nIt’s very dangerous to have material going into the lumen \n\nAnything going into the lumen is lost from the body\nIf you open tight junctions in the lining of the gut, you can essentially flow out into your bowel\n\n\n\nIs there ever a scenario where nutrients that were absorbed now go back into the lumen? \n\nBesides the obvious water and electrolytes, yes\n\nAnd worse than nutrient loss, proteins from the body can be lost\n\n\nIt turns out that underneath the lining of the gut, the capillaries are very permeable\nThere’s a lot of protein in the lymph, the fluid underneath the lining\nIf you open the lining of the gut, that protein gets into the GI tract\n\nThat’s a disease called Exudative Enteropathy; you lose protein\nPeople with that disease can blow up and look like balloons because edema goes all over the body; it’s terrible \n\n\n\nWhat is the most common cause of leaky gut?\n\nAllergy (hypersensitivity) where the immune system is reacting and causing tight junctions to open\n\nIt doesn’t have to be a food allergy specifically; the allergen doesn’t have to be in the lumen (but it can be)\nA bee sting can cause this; allergies to a bee sting are a type I hypersensitivity\n\n\n\nHow does this epithelial layer replace itself while preserving the tight junction? \n\nEpithelial cells slough off every week or so and new ones replace them\n Does this mean we have several rows of cells ready to spring into action, already tightly bound to their neighbors? \n\nSimilar to what happens in a great white shark, where they have multiple rows of teeth that are constantly pushing forward to provide new ones when teeth fall out\n\n\nThe lining in the small intestine, and to a lesser extent the large intestine, is arranged so that the lining is highly folded\nThere are projections that come up from the surface of the gut that look like fingers (called villi, shown in the figure below)\n\n\nFigure 6. Anatomy of the lining in the small intestine.  Figure credit: OpenStax Anatomy and Physiology\n\nMost absorption occurs on the surfaces of these villi\nBetween the villi are invaginations called crypts\nAt the base of crypts there are stem cells\nThe stem cells, which live next to the Paneth cell, can give rise to each of the cells that form the villi, or line the gut.\nThere’s an escalation of those cells; the progeny of the stem cells keep rising\n\nAs new ones form, other ones move up\n\n\n\n\n In part, the proliferation in the crypt produces a pressure that causes cells to rise as they differentiate\n\nBut they’re also mobile; they crawl a little bit\n\n\nIf the lining of the gut is wounded, then adjacent cells can crawl over the space and cut it off\nAt the tips of the villi, there’s a zone called the extrusion zone\n\nCells are born at the base of a crypt, climb up the crypt, up the villis, reach the tip of the villis, die, and are puffed off at that point\nThey stay in contact with one another, and the desmosomes are finally lost when the cells die, and they pop off\nThe mechanism of death is called apoptosis; they’re programmed to die.\n\n\n\nToxins, allergies, and things like that play a role in leaky and inflamed gut cells. Are there any reputable assays that can identify what these are in an individual that has otherwise vague symptoms?\n\nIf somebody has a substantially leaky gut, you could guess it from making a determination of the serum protein albumin\n\nIf the gut is leaking, albumin will be low\n\n\nYou can also look for an enzyme called alpha-1 antitrypsin\n\nThis is a protein found on the vascular side of the gut; it’s also in the blood/ plasma\nIt’s a protease inhibitor, it inhibits trypsin (produced by the pancreas) and other proteases\nLoss of protein into the gut is a sign of leaky gut; alpha-1 antitrypsin is a protein that is measured  as a marker for intestinal protein loss\n\nIf it gets onto stool there’s a problem\n\n\n\n\nDeficiency in alpha-1 antitrypsin is a hereditary disease, what symptoms do these patients have? \n\nVascular and lung disease, because there’s too much digestive action damaging in those organs\n\n\n\nDo you have to see low albumin to make the diagnosis of leaky gut? \n\nLow albumin in the plasma would indicate a very significant leaky gut\n\nAre there milder leaks that don’t allow something as massive as albumin to escape, but do allow toxins and microorganisms in? \n\nThis is controversial\nToxins are not allowed in, at  least not to a great extent (maybe a little bit)\nYou can look for toxin by giving various peptides or dyes (fluorescein) that should be excluded from blood and then look for them in the blood\nOr you can measure leaks with certain sugars that should  not be absorbed\n\nIf the non-absorbable sugar gets into the body, then you’d assume it’s a slight leak of this kind \n\n\n\nIs it thought that there is a causal relationship between leaky gut and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)? Or are these things that move together due to a similar underlying pathology? \n“The problem in the gut in autism spectrum disorder is [it’s] a disorder of the nervous system. It has nothing to do with leaky gut.”‒ Michael Gershon\n\nLeaky gut is part of the Wakefield hypothesis\n\nThere is no evidence this is correct\n\n\n\nIs leaky gut seen more often in patients with ASD? \n\nNot really\nConsider this illustration, Mike and his collaborators have a mouse called G56\n\nThis mouse has a mutation in the serotonin transporter (SERT) \n\nSERT is what the SSRIs inhibit, and they remove serotonin from circulation (or the synaptic cleft, when it’s a neurotransmitter)\nThe mutation in this mouse does not inhibit SERT, rather it makes SERT more active‒ this is the super-SERT mouse \nThis animal essentially has a deficiency of serotonin; its SERT is so effective at inactivating serotonin after it’s released that it doesn’t have a chance to act\n\n\nThese mice have a smaller nervous system in the gut, too few neurons\nThey have problems in the gut, slow transit\nThere are changes in the brain\n",

How to match it is not so easy to figure.”‒ Michael Gershon\n\nBacteria in the gut are able to get involved with the nervous system in a way that the bacteria of the skin do not\n\nFor example, the bacteria that are in the gut can activate lining epithelial cells, enteroendocrine cells to release serotonin, or other factors that can signaled by way of the vagus nerves to the brain\nChemical products that the bacteria make can also trigger nerve signals that send signals back to the brain, or even go through the blood brain barrier to affect the brain\n\n\n\nWhat happens in mice that lack the normal microbiota?\n\nExperiments can be done for example with mice, in which one can breed germ-free mice (gnotobiotic); they grow up without any contact or organisms \n\nThey’re born by cesarean section\nThey’re fed sterile food\nThey live in incubators\nPeople handle them with gloves\n\n\n\nWhat’s the phenotype of these animals after 1 year? \n\nThe numbers of nerve cells in their gut, the motility, the lining of the gut‒ they’re all different, much more primitive\nThere are changes in their immune system; they have no immune system\n\nThey have almost no spleen\nThey lack Peyer’s patches, important for talking to immune cells\nThey do have a thymus and can develop an immune system in a big hurry if they survive\n\n\nThese mice can be used as vessels to recolonize the gut with organisms\n\nIf you colonize them with bacteria derived from a strain of mice that tend to be lean, the mice grow up to be lean \nIf you colonize them with bacteria from a strain of mouse that tends to be fat, the mice grow up to be fat\n\n\n\n“That seems to indicate that bacteria can determine obesity, or lack thereof”‒ Michael Gershon\n \nFecal transplants: use cases, limitations, and how they illustrate the importance of gut microbes [1:40:45]\nHow does this play out in humans?  We don’t have sterile humans but fecal transplants from lean to obese have been done. \n\nWith humans you have to take everything with a grain of salt because the experiments are very difficult to do\n\nThe experiments are all flawed because you can’t deal with pure organisms\n\n\nThese studies have been done\nAnxiety seems to work in a similar fashion\nFecal transplantation has an enormous potential \nThe only approved use currently is for infection with Clostridium difficile \n\n Clostridium difficile is a normal component of the GI tract; many people have it, and it sits there\n\n\nWith organisms that make up the normal flora, one way the number of each type is controlled is through a balance of growth with other bacteria\n\nThere’s a competition for nutrients\nBacteria make toxins that affect other types\n\n\nA problem can arise when people take antibiotics; they have a major effect on the microbiome\nA lot of people are exposed to antibiotics in agriculture\n\nAbout 60 years ago it was found that giving antibiotics to animals will cause them to grow faster, and get bigger faster\nYou can also  keep pigs more safely in small quarters by giving them antibiotics; it reduces infection\n\n\n\n“This profligate use of antibiotics in agriculture exposes the human population to antibiotics, and changes our bacteria in ways that we would never have appreciated.”‒ Michael Gershon\nFor example, Mike’s son (who is now 60) got pneumonia when he was 2\n\nA culture was taken, and it was found to be pneumococcal pneumonia\nHe was given penicillin to treat it, he had an allergic reaction and developed an exudate of enteropathy\n\nHis skin peeled off, his teeth came in mottled, his hair and fingernails changed\nHe nearly died\n\n\n\nHow did he become allergic to penicillin at age 2 when he had never had it before? \n\nMike’s wife had a bad infection, so their son had to be bottle-fed after the first month of life\n\nHe had cow’s milk for a long time, nothing wrong with that\nBut now cow’s milk comes with penicillin in it because the agricultural industry treats with penicillin\nHis sone developed an allergy to penicillin\n\n\nMike discovered many years later that he too is allergic to penicillin\n\nThis genetic susceptibility contributed to his son developing the same allergy\n\n\nHe speculates that had his son been breast fed normally, the first time he got penicillin is when he would have been sensitized (the prerequisite for developing a type I hypersensitivity)\nHis son was exposed to penicillin in a way they never knew about\nThese antibiotics in foods are affecting the microbiome   \n\nBack to fecal transplants, how does this treat a C. diff. infection? \n\n\n\nThe procedure is not zero-risk, even though in the case of C. diff, it’s life-saving\nPatients often develop a C. diff infection after taking antibiotics\n\nAntibiotics knock out the bulk of bacteria in their large intestine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n C. diff is resistant to these antibiotics so it emerges as the dominant bacteria\n\n\n C. diff produces a toxin that causes massive diarrhea\n\nThis can wipe you out very similar to the way cholera toxin does\nIt works in a different way by targeting the nervous system\n\n\nThe first step to cure C. diff is to take oral vancomycin; C. diff is sensitive to this antibiotic \n25% of patients don’t respond to oral vancomycin, or the C. diff infection reoccurs and they can’t get rid of it, then the only thing that can be done is a fecal transplant\nFecal transplant can be done as an enema, or an enteric-coated capsule\nBacteria recolonize the antibiotic wiped-out gut\n\nThese bacteria then suppress growth of C. diff \nThis procedure is life-saving and it’s approved\n\n\n\nDifficulties with fecal transplantation \n\nThe stool used for fecal transplant has to be very carefully looked at to be sure it doesn’t contain any potentially dangerous organisms\n\nThere are perhaps 500 species of organism in your gut that are potentially lethal\n\n\nIn the past, people were transplanting from husband to wife and doing these home-brews\n\nA few patients were lost this way; it was not good\n\n\n\nIs there any potential for using synthetic biology to create the microorganism for transplant, so you could control exactly what people are given? \n\nMost of the organisms in the large intestine cannot be grown in the laboratory so this can’t be done\nMike notes, “If you can’t grow them, you can’t produce them in such a way as to synthesize them.”\nKnowing their genetic sequence is not enough\n\n “There is a huge amount of modern GI biology going into study of the GI microbiome”‒ Michael Gershon \nGut microbiome diagnostic tests: why they aren’t useful outside of special cases such as cancer detection [1:50:30]\nWhat about commercial home kits that tell you about your microbiome? \n\nThis field seems to be full of a lot of nonsense\nThere was that company out of UCSF called uBiome that turned out to be an outright fraud\nThe promise was that if you gave them a stool sample, they would send you a lengthy report of what your gut microbiome is\n\nAre they able to do this accurately? \n\nThey can give you the classes or organisms and the % of total bacteria each of the classes represent\n\nThis turns out to be remarkably un-useful\n\n\nYou need to know species by species, at a very fine level of detail before you have information you can really do something with\n\nFar too little resolution is being provided by these tests\nMike summary: You can say you can change anxiety; you can change body form with the microbiome. But to say that you can go look at the microbiome and then determine what that is, is not yet there.\n\nThe best kits he knows of are the ones that look for cancer, such as Cologuard\n\nAs the cells age and undergo apoptosis, they’re sloughed off into the lumen\nHuman DNA is in the lumen of the gut, as well as bacterial DNA\nWhat Cologuard does is look at stool, at the DNA in the stool; it looks for the genetic signatures of a number of GI cancers\nAbout 90% of GI cancer and be picked up effectively by Cologuard; it’s wonderful, it’s a great advance\n\n\nBut using this test doesn’t mean you don’t have to go also do colonoscopy\n\nThe goal of a colonoscopy is to find a polyp that’s going to become cancer, not wait until you have cancer\n\n",

    "content": "\nThe problem with Cologuard is you may miss 10% of cancer; you don’t want that to happen\n\nMike’s take on these commercial tests:  because they’re not doing it [testing] at a level that is sufficiently documented and sufficiently informative for you to be actionable on that information, they cost money abnormally, and they change what you do for reasons that are not well documented‒ you shouldn’t be following them yet. \n\nPeter notes that a lot of these tests are paired with supplements, or probiotics, or prebiotics that are supposed to “fix the defects found in the test”; it’s a RxDx model\n\n“What they’re really doing is making money. I think they’re a con.”‒ Michael Gershon\n\nPeter notes that after a decade of looking at these test results in patients that have been adamant about having them done, he’s still looking for a great example of where it mattered\n\nHe worries there is a lot of noise created without a signal\n\n\n\n\nNutritional approaches to a maintain optimal flora in the gut [1:55:00]\nPeter’s takeaway: One of the most important things nutritionally that people can do to make sure that they have the optimal flora for their gut\n\nThis is important for (1) general health maintenance and (2) after taking antibiotics\nAntibiotics are going to save our lives from time to time\nPeter has found himself more reluctant to take them; he resists as long as possible \n\nThe role of nutrition in a healthy gut microbiome\n\nFrom a general maintenance principle, for someone who is not taking a lot of antibiotics and wants to do what’s best for your gut, nutrition is one of the most important levers \n\n“The best kind of diet is a balanced diet”‒ Michael Gershon \n\nA balanced diet is better than the South Beach Diet, or one of those diets for losing weight \nHaving a balanced diet with appropriate nutrients, including vitamin C, and particularly fiber is good for your body\n\nThere’s no reason to have an excess of vitamin C\n\n\nMike would be opposed to having a particular diet for cleansing, for example\nThe microbiome is something we live with; it has evolved with humans for as long as there have been humans\n\n“Cleansing the inside of the gut is not a good thing to be doing”‒ Michael Gershon\n\nPeter has heard of many variants of gut cleansing\nOne method is done in preparation for a colonoscopy; how much does this alter the gut flora? \n\nEven though it’s purpose is simply mechanical removal of all stool matter to allow visibility for an endoscopy\nMike replies that this type of cleanse “doesn’t kill organisms or change the balance between them” \n\n\nWhen people do dietary cleanses, they’re usually drinking a lot of water with pepper and presumably some nutrients; is this similar to doing a bowel prep? \n\nMike notes that sometimes they supplement this with enemas\nHe worries about these people getting into electrolyte imbalance\nThey are not killing the bacteria\nBut they’re not doing their body a favor by eating strange foods\n\n\n\n \nThe importance of insoluble fiber in the diet \nIf people don’t eat much or any insoluble fiber, will this change their gut bacteria or impact their health negatively? \n\nNot much research has been done on the negative impact of low fiber\nResearch has focused on the health benefits of fiber and has found\n\n1 – fiber can absorb toxins; it is thought to decrease their long-term carcinogenic effects\n2 – It provides the colon something to “chew down on”; it’s good for motility and keeping the bowel going and in shape\n3 – It provides food for bacteria of the colon\n\nThese bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, which are good for the lining of the gut\nThey also produce energy; a small amount can be absorbed and used by epithelial cells in the gut\n\n\n\n\nFiber and polysaccharides are the most important  nutrients for fueling the bacteria of the gut\nThese bacteria can live on everything that makes its way to the large interesting\n\nVery little of the protein you eat gets to the colon\n\n\n\nWhat is the impact of artificial sweeteners or non-nutritive additives to food on the gut microbiome? \n\nThere are bacteria that can metabolize these molecules\nThe net effect of this is not clear\nThe literature on this is self-contradictory\n\nSome people think there are impacts\nSome people think the effect is negligible\n\n\n\nHow many fatty acids make their way to the colon?\n\nMost of the fatty acids that get to the colon are derived from fiber\nUsually they’re not exogenous, but not always\nUnder abnormal conditions in which bile salts or pancreatic enzymes are deficient, then exogenous fats can get into the colon, and one gets fatty stool\n\nBacteria can’t metabolize that\n\n\nIn celiac disease, for example, there’s a lot of fat in the stool\nIn biliary tract disease, there’s often a lot of fat in the stool\n\nThe stool is described as greasy and foul smelling, because the bacteria do metabolize it\n\n\n\n \nPrebiotics and probiotics, and getting your GI system back on track after a course of antibiotics [2:02:30]\nIf a person has to take a long course of antibiotics, what can they do to appropriately repopulate their gut?\n\nProbably taking appropriate probiotics at the same time they’re taking those antibiotics, or afterward, is helpful\n\nWhat constitutes appropriate probiotics?\n\nIt varies; some people think that yeast-derived Saccharomyces is good\nSome people swear by Lactobacilli or Bifidobacteria \nThere is evidence that taking Saccharomyces at the same time as antibiotics can lessen the GI upset and complications\n\nWhat’s the difference between a pro and a prebiotic? \n\nProbiotic is defined as an organism that has beneficial effects; you eat them\n\nFor example, Mike eats Activa every day now that he is older; it fights the problems of aging\n\nHe consults for Dannon\nWhen he mentioned Activia, that doesn’t mean this is better than any other yogurt, it’s just one he knows about\n\n\n\n\nPrebiotic is defined as material that will enable the body to grow organisms that have beneficial effect\nThe difference between them is that prebiotic enables you to make your own healthy organisms \nFermented foods are probiotics\n\nYogurt is fermented\nAdditionally, something like Activia has Bifidobacterium animalis in it, which actually survives the stomach acid, goes down the GI tract, and comes out in the stool\n\nThis is an aerotolerant anaerobe\nIt can get down in the gut and survive in the stool\n\n\n\n\n\n“The importance of the probiotic is not only that it be there, but that it survive and do something in the GI tract.”‒ Michael Gershon\nHow can people navigate this world? \n\n\n\nThere is a lot of opportunity for charlatans to sell you things that don’t have the bacteria they claim\n\nMaybe the bacteria is dead\nMaybe it doesn’t survive the transit from mouth to colon\n\n\nYou can trust the FTC and the FDA; claims cannot be made for foodstuff like a probiotic that are medical, unless it has been subjected to actual tests and pass FDA muster to show efficacy and safety\n\nMost of what they call probiotic or prebiotic has not done that\n\n\nFoodstuff, then, is regulated through the advertising by the FTC\nFor the yogurt Activia, the FTC looked very carefully at the claims made for that product, and wanted to see and carefully evaluate all of the evidence\n\nMike is a consult for Dannon and was called to testify for a hearing\nIn order to make the claims that Dannon makes for that product, they actually have to demonstrate to the FTC that they have the evidence that it does what they say it does\nThey say that if you eat as much as two cups a day of Activia, it will cause the GI tract to speed up\n\nThe answer is it will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How many colony-forming units are provided in that? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMike is not sure, something on the order of 1011 \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to getting your GI system back on track after a course of antibiotics, what are the most important elements to look for in the probiotic? \n\n\n\nSimply the ability to colonize the GI tract\n\n\n\n\n Saccharomyces works very well\n\nDo the pills need to be stored in the refrigerator? \n\nNot necessarily, the probiotic just needs to survive; this depends on the probiotic\n\n Bifidobacterium animalis, which is in Activia, has to be refrigerated; but so does the Activia, because it’s yogurt-based\n\n\nIt does not need to contain a specific Lactobacillus, just the ability to colonize the GI tract\n Saccharomyces works very well in that case\n\nMike comments, “That’s the one I’m trying to think of the trade name for.” \nIt’s well-known, it’s a yeast-derived product, it’s available over the counter\nFlorastor® by Biocodex Inc. contains Saccharomyces boulardii \n\n\n\nPeter’s takeaway: It just seems to me that the big opportunity here is going to come with the bioengineering that’s necessary to grow these bacteria in culture. That seems to be just an enormous blind spot we still have in this space, both from a diagnostic standpoint, but also from a therapeutic standpoint.\n",
