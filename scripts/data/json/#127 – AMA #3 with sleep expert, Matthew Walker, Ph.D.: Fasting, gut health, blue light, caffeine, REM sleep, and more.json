    "content": "\nOverall: Matt says the things he’s most changed his mind about recently is his understanding about the impact of blue light on sleep ⇒ “I’ve actually down-regulated my belief in the effects of blue light.”\nIn the book, for example, he wrote about study from Harvard (which he still thinks is valid)—\n\nParticipants either read on an iPad or a book under dim light for an hour\nIt showed that the iPad had this detrimental effect on sleep by delaying the release of melatonin\nThat caused a reduction in REM sleep\nThe even concluded that the effect lasted a couple days after stopping the iPad reading at night\n\nResearch by Michael Gradisar from Flinders University pushed back on that conclusion—\n\nThis study suggested it’s that these devices ACTIVATE us, and that activation masks/mutes our sleepiness so we go to bed later and lose sleep\nIt’s less about the blue light, and more about the devices ability to increase alertness/physiological arousal in the brain\nIn other words, you were sleepy all along, but these devices hit a mute button on the sleepiness\n\nIn summary:\n\nThe studies implicating blue light as especially bad for sleep were principally looking at melatonin\nIn other words, they were simply saying, How does it affect your melatonin? \nBut the next question should be, How does it then affect as a consequence of that change in melatonin?\nAnd it turns out that the melatonin piece may not be the principal reason why sleep is affected when you consider the brain arousal component\n“It really sort of made me shift my belief system.”\n\nThe next evolution of the science will be to do two types of studies—\n\nFirstly, a study where you use the same amount of light exposure but use different types of lights (type of light being the variable)\nSecondly, studies where the type of light actually becomes the constant stimulus where you maintain the same light exposure\n\nBut in one condition you’re doing something cognitively activating\nAnd in the other condition you’re getting hit with the same light but not doing anything cognitively activating\n\n\n\n \nCaffeine—How Matt has adjusted his hypothesis [12:00]\nOverall: Matt has added more construct to his beliefs around caffeine, sleep, and disease risk\nCaffeine and disease risk\n\nWhile most evidence is associational from epidemiological studies, the evidence is mounting that coffee drinkers are less at risk to “a whole constellation of diseases”\nHowever, once you get past kind of like three or four cups, things go in the opposite direction\nSeems to be a very clear association between low-to-moderate caffeine consumption and de-risking health disease conditions \n\n*Caveat: Caffeine can disrupt your sleep\n\nAnd a lack of sleep is associated with an increase in the same diseases that are said to decrease in coffee drinkers\nEven knowing this, Matt says that he might be willing to encourage more coffee consumption if there is more causal evidence that emerges\n\nThe dose and timing is what matters:\n\nThe dose AND the timing make the poison when it comes to caffeine—\nIf you’re drinking it later in the day, you’re less likely to see those health benefits\nIn fact, you would likely see health detriments\n\nMore complexity to Matt’s hypothesis:\n\nMatt’s thinking has been shaped after listening to the audiobook called Caffeine by Michael Pollan\nPollan believes that the health benefits are not really due to a cup of coffee, but the fact that the coffee bean itself carries with it lots of antioxidants\nAnd for many Americans who don’t get a balanced diet, coffee in the morning may be one of the only primary sources of antioxidant consumption which may explain the health associations\nA review paper from 2017 showed that decaffeinated coffee carries the same antioxidant load, but without the caffeine\n\nMatt’s personal behavioral adjustment:\n\nHe now drinks decaffeinated coffee in the mornings\nHe’s still concerned about caffeine’s effect on sleep even when consumed in the morning \nThis study showed that dosing people with caffeine at 7 AM lead to a reduction in the quality of that deep sleep\n\nGenetic differences amongst individuals:\n\nThere are genetic differences in how quickly people metabolize caffeine\nSome people have very little sensitivity to caffeine, for example, and for those people caffeine in the morning is fine \n\n \nREM sleep—Why Matt is more bullish on the importance of dream sleep [16:30]\nOverall: Matt has become even more bullish on the importance of REM sleep\nBackstory:\n\nAll stages of sleep are important",

    "content": "\nDifferent functions are carried out by different stages of sleep at different times of night\nDeep sleep is most commonly considered the most important and many people ask how they can get more deep sleep\nREM sleep, says Matthew, is “sort of the neglected stepsister in the health conversation of sleep”\n\nMatt says the dismissal of REM sleep is disappointing for two reasons—\n\n1) REM sleep is particularly important for emotional/mental health (see Matt Walker-Part 4)\n2) A lack of REM sleep seems to be more deadly than a lack of deep non-REM sleep\n\nEvidence that lack of REM sleep is more deadly:\n\nIn the 1980s, scientists selectively sleep deprived rats of REM sleep or non-REM deep sleep and found they die sooner from the lack of REM sleep\nA recent study found a linear relationship between REM sleep and mortality—(i.e., the more REM sleep that you got, the lower your mortality risk and vice versa)\n\nFor every 5% reduction in your REM sleep, there was a 13% increase in your mortality risk\nNot just all cause mortality, but specific disease states such as cardiovascular disease risk\nThey found that if you collect all of these sleep variables, REM sleep was the single most predictive variable for your mortality risk\n\n\nCaveat: These are association studies and do not confer causality \n\nHow much REM sleep do we believe a person should have per night? \n\nThe recommendation for the average adult is for about 20% of your sleep to be consumed by REM sleep\nAnd it’s also age-dependent to a degree\n\nWhat is the age-appropriate breakdown of sleep stages as a percentage of total sleep?\n\nOne of the problems with sleep trackers is…\n\nIt tells you what percentage of your total sleep are consumed by deep sleep and REM sleep\nHowever, it doesn’t tell you what the appropriate amount should be (e.g., Is 14% REM sleep good or bad?)\nNote: It’s not the fault of the sleep tracking companies, they just don’t really have the data because there’s not much in the way of scientific literature around that\n\n\n\nMatthew’s quest to create standardized norms—\n\nMatthew is working with Dr. Raphael Vallat who has gathered over 14,000 nights of polysomnography across 14,000 people ranging in age from 5 to 97-years-old\nThey’ve created statistical models of age-appropriate norms and hope to publish the data soon\n\nIn addition, they are working on a web-based tool—\n\nThe idea is you go to a website and type in your age, sex, BMI, and other important data and it will tell you what your appropriate levels of deep sleep/REM sleep should be based on your age and physiology\n\nCould your sleep data predict your biological age?\n\nAssuming sleep trackers eventually become close to 100% accurate (currently not there yet)…\nUsing the data from a single night of sleep, it would be possible to predict your chronological age with about a 75% accuracy using our machine learning algorithms\nBut what’s MORE interesting is that this data could contribute towards being able to predict your biological age\n\n“Could we think that sleep could now provide a contribution to this Horvath clock of determining your biological age? Has sleep got some predictive signaling? I think it probably does.”\nPeople working on epigenetic clocks:\n\nDavid Sinclair\nSteve Horvath\n\n⇒ Here’s the paper that Matt and Peter recently published together\n \nHow to increase REM sleep [27:30]\nDeep non-REM sleep is easier to manipulate than REM sleep\n\nPeter provides tips for more deep sleep in AMA #12\nMatt’s review paper with methods that have been used to improve deep sleep quality\n\nThe challenge of getting more REM sleep \n\nREM sleep is very difficult to modulate in an easy way\nThere’s a neurochemical in the brain called acetylcholine and REM sleep is powerfully regulated by acetylcholine\nSo people would manipulate this pharmacology to do REM sleep manipulation\nBut since most people are not going to have (nor should that want) anticholinergics or pro-cholinergic agents (Plus they also have side effects in the body because it also controls things like smooth muscle out in the periphery)\n\nSo how can you do this? \n\nMatt has one idea that he’s about to start testing and it has to do with temperature\nFor deep sleep, you cool the body to actually increase deep sleep—You actually have to warm up to get cold, to get to sleep, and then you have to stay cold to stay asleep and get deep sleep",

    "content": "\nBut then to wake up, you have to warm up\nBut now we’re talking about needing a temperature increase in order to increase REM sleep BEFORE you wake up\n\nMore about the nature REM sleep—\n\nREM sleep is a bizarre state where the brain seems to get disconnected from the body in terms what’s called the autonomic regulation (during REM sleep become very autonomically dysregulated)\nWhat this actually means is that your brain’s systems of controlling and regulating your nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic) and your automatic functions (breathing and respiration) all go out the window during REM sleep\nAnd in fact, you go into these huge accelerations in heart rate, then your heart rate decreases, and then increases again (and it’s not predictable, it’s very erratic)\nYour temperature is also uncontrolled—In other words, you stop thermoregulating during REM sleep\n\nHow does this lack of thermoregulation help us think about increasing REM sleep?\n\nThermoneutrality is when you can get the temperature around your body (i.e., under your covers) to the same temperature that is natural for your body\nAnd if you can match those two things, you can get to thermoneutrality and promote REM sleep\nAs you go further away from thermoneutrality for your body, you disrupt REM sleep\nThe hard part is actually monitoring your body temperature with a device and then exquisitely control your body temperature to keep you in the sweet spot of thermoneutrality sweet spot during the last two hours of your sleep\nIf that can be done precisely, you can increase your REM sleep\n\nWould something like the Ooler work for this?\n\nPeter is a huge fan of a device called an Ooler— a water-cooled pad that goes under your mattress \nPeter asks whether you could simply have a setting added that increases the temperature a few hours before you were planning to wake up in order to increase REM sleep\nMatt says that that can work for the process of waking up, but probably not for increasing REM sleep\n\nTo specifically increase REM sleep, you need a closed-loop system—\n\nBy that he means you need real-time data to understand the exact temperature of your body and the  exact stage of sleep that you’re in\nAnd in order to compliment those—to “close the loop”—you need to be constantly monitoring and tweaking, monitoring and tweaking, to keep you in this sweet spot\nMatt says that they are currently exploring this concept and he is “actually quite excited about it especially because I’ve now become so bullish on REM sleep”\n\n \nSleep tracking wearables—criteria for evaluation, and why Matthew favors Oura [35:00]\nMatt thinks about 2 different criteria when it comes to wearables:\n1—Accuracy of sleep data relative to the gold standard of recordings in the sleep laboratory \n\nOura Ring does a decent job of that (FitBit and other may be similar in accuracy, says Matt)\nLooking at the entire industry of sleep trackers, they are about 70% overall accurate in terms the measurement of total sleep \nThe accuracy starts to decline for the different stages of sleep\nThe accuracy is particularly bad for the amount of time that you are awake at night, meaning your “wake after sleep onset”\nMatt says he is excited to work for Oura to see if he can help improve the accuracy\n\n2—Form factor\n\nWhen we go to bed, we typically take things off, we don’t put things on\nSleep tracking devices that use headbands or wristwatches devices are things that are typically not worn in bed\nSo while they may have some advantages to them, Matt thinks the adherence, the compliance, is going to be low for those types of things\nEven if watches, headbands, and the like are 100% accurate, they are useless if people won’t consistently wear them\n\nIt’s a two-by-two matrix—\n\nOn the one hand, I’ve got how accurate it is\nOn the other hand, I’ve got how friction-full or friction-less the device is. \nWhat you want is a device that’s very low friction and very high accuracy \n\n\nFigure 1. 2 x 2 matrix showing ideal tracking device qualities.\nSome reasons why Matt favors the Oura Ring:\n\nIt has comparable accuracy to other devices\nIt has some sensing advantages like body temperature\nAnd being it’s a ring, Matt says there’s a higher likelihood for compliance\n\n \nDoes the electromagnetic force of devices have any impact on sleep?

    "content": "\nIs there any evidence that simply having electronics in a room, through some form of electromagnetic force, is impacting sleep? \nIn other words, if you take the light stimulation out of the equation, does that have any bearing on sleep?\n\nThere’s no evidence that the electromagnetic force of one of those devices impacts someone’s sleep\nPerhaps that would change is someone essentially duct-taped a device to their head (only Peter did that in medical school so as to not sleep through getting paged at night)\nMatt says the first place one might look is at environmental studies where you look at people who are living very close to high-grade, overhead power lines\nThe problem is that this type of data may not be useful since there would be so many confounding variables\n\n \nThe relationship between fasting and sleep [46:15]\nSleep issues with prolonged fasting\n\nPeter says some of his patients who do multi-day fasting (3+ days) will struggle with falling asleep and staying asleep at night (less so with time-restricted eating or just a 1-day fast)\nOn flip side, the sleep you DO get actually seems remarkable\nPeter, for example, notices that the following sleep metrics improve:\n\nHeart rate variability goes up by 25- 50%\nResting heart rate goes down\nBody temperature goes down\nHis best nights in terms of staging—Deep sleep is 25%, REM sleep is 25%.\n\n\n\nWhat are Matt’s thoughts overall on the relationship between food deprivation and sleep?\n\nMatt commonly hears the following from fasters—\n\nThey struggle with falling asleep and staying asleep\nHowever, he also hears in many cases that the lesser amount of sleep doesn’t bother them\nIn other words, they don’t feel as sleepy as they normally would (i.e., that little sleep would normally have them feeling miserable)\n\n\n\nWhat might explain these observations?\n\nSome animal literature centers around a chemical called orexin\nIn the middle of your brain there is a tiny structure called the hypothalamus\n\nDespite its size, it has profound effects on almost all of our behaviors, such as:\n\nEating behaviors\nSleep-wake regulation\nThermoregulation. \n\n\nAnd within the hypothalamus, there is a cluster of cells called orexin cells\n\nOne of their functions is to actually monitor the body’s energy balance by sensing, among other things, concentrations of circulating levels of leptin and ghrelin\nThey essentially get a map of the body’s energy balance. \nThe brain’s sensing neurons will release the chemical contained inside of them, which is called orexin.\n\n\n\n\n\n⇒ See this paper: Role of orexin in modulating arousal, feeding, and motivation\nHow is orexin relevant to sleep?\n\nOrexin turns out to be a wake promoting chemical\nSo when you release and dump orexin into the brain and the body, it wakes the brain up\nNormally it shuts down at night and that’s part of the mechanism of what we call the sleep-wake switch\n\nWhat attenuates orexin during a fed state?\n1—Hunger signaling hormones like leptin and ghrelin will regulate it\n2—It’s also regulated by the master circadian clock called the suprachiasmatic nucleus \n\nOrexin, like many other hormones and chemicals, seem to be under the control of our 24 hour circadian rhythm which is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus\nYou can think of this as the central master clock of the brain which also regulates the release of other things (like melatonin from the pineal gland) and essentially giving out the instructions as to when to release wake promoting chemicals like orexin and when to release sleep promoting chemicals\n\n3—Another part of regulation of orexin is independent of your sleep-wake, it’s actually dependent on your body’s energy balance\n\nWhen animals go under conditions of starvation, these orexin cells sense the change in the energy balance and they start dumping out more orexin which forces the animal artificially awake for a longer period of time\nThe evolutionary reason is because it’s recognizing that the amount of time the animal is normally awake for it to forage for food is not sufficient because it’s starving\nIn other words, the brain is telling the animal to stay awake longer so it can find more food and avoid starvation\nIn humans under conditions of fasting, Matt thinks you are giving the body an ancient, evolutionary signal of starvation which causes the brain to dump more orexin into the system and therefore your sleep becomes compressed\n\n*Partial explanation for why sleep metrics improve while in a fasted state:\n",

Melatonin extends the life of sleep deprived flies—Figure B shows examples of survival curves for three rescuing compounds: melatonin, lipoic acid, and NAD. The compounds that were able to rescue survival were effective at clearing ROS (Figure C). Rescue of survival was achieved without increasing sleep itself; all animals remained sleep deprived when supplemented with antioxidants. This was true even for melatonin, primarily known for its effects on the mammalian circadian clock, melatonin does not seem to play a major role in controlling circadian rhythmicity or sleep in flies. A lesser known fact is that melatonin is a potent antioxidant (Tan et al., 2015), produced at high levels in the vertebrate gut. Image credit: Vaccaro et al., 2020 \nApplication in the real world:\n\nIdeally, there is no “need” for sleep deprivation therefore no need to treat for it\nBut the reality is that there is an obligatory need for sleep deprivation at certain times (think about an emergency surgeon on call) and we’re not protecting those individuals as best we could do \nMatt thinks that perhaps melatonin could be a countermeasure to “obligatory sleep deprivation”\n\n ",

It’s going to be tailored to you like a Savile Row suit.”\n***\nIdea #2—Predictolytics \n\nThis has largely been considered in behavioral change to shift you away from maladaptive behaviors\nGood example would be smoking:\n\nIf you continue this habit, in 20 years time…\n\nThis is how you will look, this is how your teeth will look\nHere are the different disease curves and the trajectory of your risk for cardiovascular disease for stroke\n\n\nThen, you show them how those things change if the habit of smoking is reduced…\n\nI.e., If you go down to 10 cigarettes a day rather than 20, or down to 5, or down to 0…\n\nHere’s how you’re going to look in 20 years\nHere’s the change in your risk profile for these different diseases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt wants to do something similar with sleep:\n\nIf you continue sleeping only 5.5 hr/night…\n\nThis is your disease trajectories (i.e., Alzheimer’s, hormones, mental health, heart disease, etc.)\n\n\nBut if you increase your sleep time time to 7, 7.5, or 8 hrs per night…\n\nHere’s how those things change\n\n\nThe person can then be offered simple suggestions (e.g., bedtime alarm and wake alarm)\n\n\nRight now we’re doing a lot of quantification in the world of tracking, but we’re not doing much modification\n\n“I’m interested in these ideas of ‘predictolytics’ because I can do modification on the basis of quantification.”\n \nQuestions Matt would like to explore if money was no issue [1:24:15]\nQuestion #1—Super agers — Could sleep represent a new “physiological blue zone”?\nCognitive decline with age\n\nAs we get older our sleep gets worse, and that seems to predict cognitive decline, e.g, an escalation in Alzheimer’s disease related proteins (tau and beta amyloid)\nBut what about these centenarians who don’t see the same cognitive decline?\nFor example, there are times when two individuals will present with the same amount of tau and beta amyloid in the brain, yet one person has no cognitive decline whereas the other has massive cognitive impairment\nMatt wonders whether or not sleep is an unknown factor that is coming in and creating a cushion, or a force that is a countermeasure against pathology\n\nMetabolic and inflammatory markers\n\nIf you look at this patient’s blood work and you see high C-reactive protein, insulin resistance, and other markers of aging, but yet they still seem to be alive and healthy…\nIs sleep this countermeasure in all of this? Is sleep and new physiological blue zone? \n",
