You just decided that you’re going to sleep half of what is evolutionarily programmed? … Does it strike you as odd that evolution would have designed us to spend a third of our life, not mating, not watching out for predators, not hunting for food, but doing this thing for some other purpose? Do you think that thing must have been important?”\nOvernight it changed the way Peter thought about sleep, which was that evolution went to great lengths to do this\n\n“Sleep is the greatest life support system you could ever wish for. It’s a remarkable health insurance policy, it’s largely democratic, free and largely painless”‒ Matt Walker\nSleep is the foundation of health\n\nIn terms of de-risking just about every disease that is killing us in the developed world, it’s very hard to look no further than sleep\nNutrition and exercise are important, but sleep is the foundation\n“Sleep is the foundation on which those two other things sit. It’s not the third pillar of good health, I think it is the foundation”\n\nHow long can you survive without sleep? \n\nThe record someone survived without food might be 382 days (a lean person maybe 30 days)\nDeprivation of sleep causes the quickest reduction of health\nGuinness has banned trying to set record for sleep deprivation (record might have been up to 24 days) because it’s so dangerous (cancer, mental health, CVD, metabolic syndrome, suicidality).\nThink about this:\n\nFelix Baumgartner went up in hot air balloon to outer surface of Earth and then jumped out, fell over 1000/km/hr, broke sound barrier\nThat was NOT banned by Guinness, but sleep deprivation was – gives you sense of how dangerous it is not to sleep\n\n\n\n \nStages of sleep, sleep cycles, and brainwaves [10:00]\nFrom episode #47 – Matthew Walker, Ph.D., on sleep – Part I of III: Dangers of poor sleep, Alzheimer’s risk, mental health, memory consolidation, and more; discussed from [40:15] – [54:45]\n\nLet’s shift gears a little and go back to the polysom \nLet’s explain:\n\nThe stages of sleep, different patterns of brain waves (as measured by an EEG), see the figure below\nCommercially available ways to track\n\nPeter thinks these are still not accurate enough to compare them to their polysom\n\n\n\n\n\nHumans (mammals) have 2 stages of sleep:\n\n1 – Non-REM\n\nNon-REM has 4 stages‒ cleverly titled stages 1, 2, 3, and 4\nStages 3 and 4 are the very deep restorative stages\nStages 1 and 2 are the lightest stages of sleep\n\n\n2 – REM\n\nREM sleep (REM = rapid eye movement, based on the bizarre horizontal shifting eye movements)\n\n\nNon-REM + REM sleep combine to form 90 minute sleep cycles \n\nEvery 90 minutes, your brain cycles between non-REM and REM sleep\nThen this is replayed every 90 minutes to create what we call a standard cycling architecture of sleep, or what we call a hypnogram of sleep\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The brainwaves of wake and sleep. Image credit: Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker\nBrainwaves when first lie down (before you fall asleep) \n\nAlpha rhythm\nFrenetic high-frequency electrical activity with a small amplitude (see the figure above)\nAnalogy‒ if you held a microphone over a sports stadium, what you’re picking up is the signal from the crowd before the game starts‒ that’s wakefulness\n\nDuring wakefulness, the 100,000 people in the stadium (the 100,000 neurons) are all talking to each other but not in any kind of coordination\nThis results in a very nonsynchronous signal but voices (neurons) cancel each other out\nThe size of the brain wave is not very big \nBut the frequency is high, it goes up and down maybe 50-60x per second\n\n\nBefore you start to go to sleep, the back of brain (visual brain) is the first part that starts to settle down\n\nIt goes into alpha rhythm when you close your eyes\nIt stops processing the outside world\nThe frequency slows from 50 cycles/sec to 10 cycles/sec (still relatively low amplitude)\n\n\n\nTransitioning to sleep \n\nYou can see this transition in your bed partner\nEyeballs start to roll (slow rolling eye movements) \n\nThis is the first sign of transition to sleep (the reason is unknown)\n\n\nFirst you go into the light stages of non-REM, stages 1 and 2\nAfter ~20 minutes you go into the deep stages 3 and 4 of non-REM sleep\n\nStages of non-REM \n\nIn stage 1: theta waves begin\nStage 2:\n\n50 cycles/sec down to 6-7 cycles/sec, the amplitude is getting bigger\nEvery now and then, you’ll get these synchronous bursts of electrical activity called sleep spindles ⇒ big slow wave, then a burst of spindle\n\nThe sleep spindles go up to 10-15 cycles/sec and last for about 1.5 seconds\n\n\n\n\nStages 3 and 4:\n\nBrain in synchronous chant of slow waves\nThe brain waves slow down to 1 or 2 cycles/sec, but the size of the waves are huge\nBack to the stadium analogy‒ during the game spectators are chanting in unison, it’s louder and everyone is making the same sounds together and you can actually hear what’s being said\nNow the brain coordinates hundreds of thousands of neurons to fire together and go silent together\n\nThis is unique\n\n\nThe frequency is slow, once a second, and this looks in some ways like coma\nSleep scientists in the past thought this was a time that the brain is not doing nothing\n\nNow we realize the opposite is true\n\n\nDuring this deep sleep info transfer occurs in brain \nAnalogy‒ a long-wave radio, if you’re in the city you tune into FM (short-wave radio) and pick up a bunch of signals, but the further you drive out into the desert/ countryside you lose those channels because the range from the tower is short\n\nBut if you go to the long-wave radio stations, you can pick up signals for hundreds of miles because the carrier frequency of those radio waves is much slower allowing the distance for transferring information to be much further\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep sleep is a brain state of long-distance information transfer \nHow to tell the difference between stage 3 & 4 \n\nThey are both delta waves\nThey are difficult to distinguish morphologically\nDefined as a proportion of 30-second period of sleep that is consumed by deep slow wave activity\n\nStage 3 is less than 50%\nStage 4 is more than 50%\n\n\nWaves in stage 4 are larger in amplitude and slower in frequency \n\nStages must occur in order with 2 exceptions\n\n1 – Narcolepsy pathology– one goes from being awake straight into REM sleep\n2 – If chronically REM sleep derived, occasionally you can go into REM sleep directly (e.g., heavy alcohol use)\n\nAlcohol blocks your REM sleep\n\n\n\nSummary of the 90 minute cycle \n\nGo through stage 1-4 on non-REM\nThen after 70 min, you go back to stage 2 on non-REM\nThen you will briefly transition to REM sleep\nThen you flip flop between non-REM and REM ⇒ back down into non-REM, back to REM, back to non-REM, back to REM\n\nWhat changes is the ratio of non-REM to REM within that 90 minute period, as you move across the night \n\nIn first half of night, the majority of 90 minute cycle is deep non-REM and very little REM sleep (see the figure below)\nIn the second half of the night, the majority of the cycle is REM and almost no deep sleep \nIf get 6 hours sleep (instead of 8), you’re losing 25% of sleep, but you could be losing up to 70% of all REM sleep \n\n\nFigure 2. The architecture of sleep. Image credit:  Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker\nYou always go through a linear progression of the stages of the sleep cycle \n \nUnderstanding sleep chronotypes and how knowing yours could help you [25:45] \nFrom episode #126 – Matthew Walker, Ph.D.: Sleep and immune function, chronotypes, hygiene tips, and addressing questions about his book; discussed from [1:06:00] – [1:16:37]\nYour sleep chronotype simply means \n\nAre you a morning person? (25-30% of the population)\nAre you an evening person? (25-30% of the population)\nOr are you somewhere in between? (the rest of us 40-50%)\n\nSleep science breaks it into 4 categories \n\n1 – Extreme morning types\n2 – Morning types\n3 – Middle evening types\n4 – Extreme evening types\n\nThere is a strong genetic component underlying sleep chronotypes \n\nEvidence that it’s genetic‒ \n1 – There is a significant degree of heritability\n2 – There are a collection of genes that will determine, to a degree, your chronotype\n\n\nData from 23andMe says there’s about 9 different genes that will contribute to your chronotype \nMost are what we call “clock genes”‒ this refers to the fact that these genes control the rhythm of your circadian cycle\nThese genes control WHEN that sinusoidal wave of your circadian cycle arrives on the clock face\n\nSaid another way, “If you have a certain type of gene compliment that makes you a morning type‒  your peak alertness is going to arrive earlier in the day and the downstroke of your circadian rhythm will arrive earlier in the evening“ \n\n\nFor an evening type, your circadian rhythm looks very similar in its sinusoidal pattern but WHEN the peak and the trough of that circadian rhythm arrive on the 24 hour clock face is very different than for a morning type \n\nEvolution of the sleep-wake cycle over your lifetime \n\nNo matter what chronotype you are, you will change as you develop from a young child to an adolescent teen, to an adult, to an older adult\nMore of a morning type when you’re a kid\nA teen’s chronotype makes your bedtime later and your wake time later in the morning (sleeping more in total)\n\nThis is a problem for early school start times\n\n\nOnce you become an adult (age 30-40), bedtime becomes a little earlier\nAs we get older, we tend to go to bed earlier and earlier (with earlier wake times)\n\nYour innate chronotype can still be twisted/contorted by non-genetic forces  \n\nExamples‒ modern social norms, light exposure, technology, etc.\nInteresting experiment‒ a camping study during winter\n",

discussed from [2:29:15] – [2:31:45]\nSleep duration \n\nWhen Matt recommends getting 7-9 hours of sleep per night, he is talking about actual sleep, not just time in bed\n\nSleep efficiency\n\nThe time you are asleep divided by the time you are in bed\nYou might only be asleep for 85-90% of the time you are lying in bed\nIf you are someone who needs 8 hours of actual sleep, and you’re sleep efficiency is about 90%, then you need to be lying in bed for approx. 8 hours and 50 minutes (sleep opportunity)\n\nSleep opportunity \n\nThis is the time you plan to be in bed with the opportunity to sleep\n\nPlan for 8-9 hours in bed to get 7-8 hours of total sleep \nOura ring\n\nPeter says this is why he loves the Oura ring\nIt’s very good at telling you how long you were in bed and how much of that time you were actually asleep\n\nIt will tell you your total sleep time\n\n\n\nWhat Peter tells his patients… \n\nIf there’s a problem with total sleep time and efficiency is low, you have to improve the quality\nIf total sleep time is low and efficiency is high, you need more time in bed\n\n \nCorrecting insomnia: a counterintuitive approach [38:45]\nFrom episode #58 – AMA with sleep expert, Matthew Walker, Ph.D.: Strategies for sleeping more, sleeping better, and avoiding things that are disrupting sleep; discussed from [2:31:45] – [2:34:45]\nThe caveat for insomnia patients \n\nIf you’re someone who’s struggling with insomnia and you’re lying in bed awake a lot of the time, you may need to decrease your time in bed to increase sleep pressure\nIt’s counterintuitive, but one of the tools in the CBT-I toolbox is to shorten the sleep opportunity\nRe-establish confidence that you can fall asleep in bed\nConstraining the person down to just 6 hours of sleep opportunity\nBy compressing that window down you’re sleeping less and you’re building up more of that sleep pressure because as a consequence of the reduction of sleep opportunity time, you’re going to be awake during the day longer\nThe longer that you’re awake, the more of that sleep pressure you build up\nThe idea is force your brain to realize that it only has this tiny opportunity of 6 hours so it must take advantage\n\n“It’s this ironic way that we help treat insomnia.  We constrain total sleep time.  Use brute force efficiency in a brute force response from the brain and all of a sudden something magical happens.  You start to control your sleep rather than your sleep controlling you.”‒ Matt Walker \nExample insomnia patient‒  someone who’s chronotype is early to bed, early to rise, but they’re having problems with insomnia \n\nDo you push them more on delaying bedtime? ⇒ Slice off the sleep opportunity on both sides\nNext, you should hold the wake up time constant\nAnd then try to go to be a tad earlier, and earlier\nIf you have a set back you can “reign it back in” by shortening the sleep opportunity again\n\n“This is usually one of the last tools in the CBT-I box that you typically use just because it’s so hard for compliance and adherence and it is pretty miserable because we’re putting you on essentially a short sleep restriction… but it’s a wonderful way for the patient to then finally feel as though they have control because it’s a technique that they can use once they understand how the sleep system works.”‒ Matt Walker \n \nPros and cons of napping, and insights from the sleep habits of hunter-gatherer tribes [41:30]\nFrom episode #126 – Matthew Walker, Ph.D.: Sleep and immune function, chronotypes, hygiene tips, and addressing questions about his book; discussed from [42:15] – [56:45]\n\nNow that we’ve set the stage for what sleep is and why it’s so important, these next set of clips will look at ways we can improve sleep\nWe’ll look at the pros and cons of napping\nProper sleep hygiene\nIdeal wind-down routine\nOptimal temperature for sleep\nHow Matt changed his thinking on blue light\n\nPros and cons of napping \n\nNaps as short as 17 minutes can produce learning and memory benefits (unpublished data from Matt)\nAnd you can some benefit from a cardiovascular standpoint as well (unpublished data from Matt)\nDownside of naps is that it can take away sleep pressure which could exacerbate nighttime sleep issues\n\nIf you’re struggling with falling asleep at night (sleep onset insomnia) \n\nAvoid naps during the day \nYou want to build up as much sleep pressure/sleepiness as you possibly can during the day\n\n\nOn the flip side‒ \n\nIf you are NOT struggling with your sleep at night, there’s no problem with napping regularly during the day\n\n\n\nLooking at biphasic sleep of hunter-gatherers \n\nIf you study hunter-gatherer tribes (whose way of life hasn’t changed for thousands of years), they don’t necessarily sleep the way that we do today\nDuring the summer months, they will typically have an afternoon nap\nThis make sense because when you study human brains you see that somewhere between about 2:00 to 4:00 PM we have a drop in physiological alertness\nAs a species, we’re almost pre-programmed to have this enforced dip in our alertness suggesting maybe we should be biphasically sleeping at certain times during the year\n\nAs opposed to monophasically sleeping\n\n\n\nHow long is the afternoon nap by the hunter-gatherers? \n\nTypically pretty short, says Matt, less than 90 minutes\nHunter gatherers would typically sleep just 6.5 hours at night, and then they would make the rest up with an afternoon nap \n\nWhen combined, this matches most sleep experts recommendation that we get 7-9 hours per night\n\n\n\nIs this like the “first and second sleep” of the Dickensian era? \n\nNo, this is very different to something else that’s been described in the literature, which is “first sleep and second sleep”, documented during the Dickensian era\nPeople would sleep for the first 4 hours—then they would wake up in the middle of the night to write, drink, socialize, etc.—then they would go back for another 4 hours of sleep\nOverall, that sleep pattern was more sociologically-driven rather than biologically-driven \n\nOther interesting things about hunter-gatherers \n\n1 – The concept of midnight‒ it’s the middle of the night for them, i.e., “mid”-night because they usually go to bed around 8:30-9pm and then they’re awake just a little bit before dawn\n2 – Temperature (not daylight) wakes them up‒ a rise in temperature seems to happen before daylight starts to break and it seems that regulation of the sleep-wake rhythm is more tied to temperature\n\n \nSleep hygiene, wind-down routine, and tips for better sleep [50:15]\nFrom episode #126 – Matthew Walker, Ph.D.: Sleep and immune function, chronotypes, hygiene tips, and addressing questions about his book; discussed from [56:45] – [1:06:00]\n\nCaveat‒ Matt is not a sleep physician so it is not his practice to treat individuals\nHe’s a sleep researcher so he’s infinitely more qualified to help people start to think through the parameters that factor into sleep\n\n5 main sleep hygiene tips \n\n1 – Regularity: Going to bed at the same time, waking up at the same time. \n2 – Light: Getting lots of darkness at night because we are a dark-deprived society (and making sure you get daylight during the first half of the day)\n3 – Temperature: You need to get cool to get to sleep\n4 – “Walk it out”: Don’t lie awake in bed because trains your brain to be triggered by your bed and force you awake because you have a learned association \n\nTIP: If you’ve been awake for 20 minutes, then get up, go and do something else and only come back to bed when you’re sleepy\n\n\n5 – Alcohol/caffeine: Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and alcohol in the evening\n\n“Sleep is much more like trying to land a plane. It takes time to gradually descend down onto that hard foundation of this thing that we call a stable night of sleep.”‒ Matt Walker\nAdditional advice for optimizing sleep \n\n1 – Wind-down routine\n\nThis is absolutely critical to build it into your routine, says Matt\nMany people in society expect sleep to be like a light switch‒ it’s just not like that\nA routine might be 15 minutes for some, for others it’s 30 minutes\nThings like light stretches, meditation, putting all of your phones and your gadgets away can be part of the routine\n\n\n2 – Remove clock faces\n\nIf you are struggling with sleep, remove all clock faces from your bedroom\nKnowing that it’s now 2:35 AM in the morning is only going to trigger more anxiety\nThis study from UC Berkeley by Allison Harvey showed that removing clock faces was helpful for poor sleepers with insomnia\n\n\n3 – Remove technology from the bedroom\n\nTechnology (esp. phones) can cause “anticipatory anxiety”\n\nDon’t make checking your phone (e.g., emails, texts, etc.) the first thing you do in the morning\nThis trains your brain in a “Pavlovian way” that even as your tucking yourself in bed at night to expect that anxiety waiting for you on your side table \nThis “anticipatory anxiety” actually lightens your sleep throughout the night because of that expectation\n\n\nTechnology can result in “sleep procrastination”\n\nExample would be scrolling through your phone looking for that next interesting thing and procrastinating the process of putting your mind to rest\n\n\nTip from Matt’s colleague, Michael Grandner‒ if you’re going to have your phone in your bedroom, make it a rule that you can only use it if you’re standing up. After 5-10 minutes of standing you just think, “God, I just want to sit down. I just want to get into bed.” \nPeter has started a new habit that he enjoys‒ don’t look at your phone for an hour after you wake up\n\n\n4 – Set manageable goals\n\nMatt references BJ Fogg, a researcher at Stanford, who looks at behavioral change and applies it to sleep\n\nIf you are accustomed to checking your phone the moment you wake up, try to start by giving yourself 5 minutes without checking it\nNext, keep pushing it longer and longer (10 min, 20 min, and so on)\nDon’t set yourself up for failure, ease into it and set yourself up for success\n\n\n\n\n\n*Important Note: These tips are for improving your sleep performance, and are for people without a sleep disorder. If you do have an actual sleep disorder (insomnia, apnea, etc.) you need to get help from a physician. \n \nThe optimal room temperature and body temperature for the best sleep [59:30]",

discussed from [5:45] – [12:15]\nOverall: Matt says the things he’s most changed his mind about recently is his understanding about the impact of blue light on sleep ⇒ “I’ve actually down-regulated my belief in the effects of blue light”\nIn the book, for example, he wrote about study from Harvard (which he still thinks is valid) \n\nParticipants either read on an iPad or a book under dim light for an hour\nIt showed that the iPad had this detrimental effect on sleep by delaying the release of melatonin\nThat caused a reduction in REM sleep\nThe even concluded that the effect lasted a couple days after stopping the iPad reading at night\n\nResearch by Michael Gradisar from Flinders University pushed back on that conclusion \n\nThis study suggested it’s that these devices ACTIVATE us, and that activation masks/mutes our sleepiness so we go to bed later and lose sleep\nIt’s less about the blue light, and more about the devices ability to increase alertness/physiological arousal in the brain\nIn other words, you were sleepy all along, but these devices hit a mute button on the sleepiness\n\nIn summary \n\nThe studies implicating blue light as especially bad for sleep were principally looking at melatonin\nIn other words, they were simply saying, “How does it affect your melatonin?” \nBut the next question should be, “How does it then affect as a consequence of that change in melatonin?”\n\nAnd it turns out that the melatonin piece may not be the principal reason why sleep is affected when you consider the brain arousal component \n“It really sort of made me shift my belief system”‒ Matt Walker\n\nMatt now thinks these devices are simply mentally stimulating, and he is interested in the invasion of devices into our evenings and bedrooms\n\nThe next evolution of the science will be to do 2 types of studies \n\n1 – Studies where you use the same amount of light exposure but use different types of lights (type of light being the variable‒ blue light versus red light)\n\nStudies have played around with the wavelength of light and have found that the shorter wavelength (blue light) is most detrimental\nStudies years ago by Charles Czeisler and Steve Lockley at Harvard show that short wavelength light stamps the brakes on melatonin, and this led to this belief  \nScreens were blamed because they are LED-based, which is enriched for shorter wavelength light \nThese studies focused more on melatonin and less on the polysomnography of a full nights sleep (where the downstream consequences could be assessed)\n\n\n2 – Studies where the type of light actually becomes the constant stimulus where you maintain the same light exposure but cognitively arousing activity is different\n\nIn one condition you’re doing something cognitively activating\nIn the other condition you’re simply getting hit with the same light but not doing anything cognitively activating\n\n\n\n \nCaffeine: how Matt has adjusted his hypothesis [1:14:45]\nFrom episode #127 – AMA #3 with sleep expert, Matthew Walker, Ph.D.: Fasting, gut health, blue light, caffeine, REM sleep, and more; discussed from [12:00] – [16:30]\n\nIn the last set of clips we’ll focus on the effect caffeine can have on sleep and the dangers of sleeping pills \nIf you find yourself enjoying this content, we have 7 episodes with Matt including 3 AMAs (see the selected links section at the end)\n\nOverall: Matt has added more construct to his beliefs around caffeine, sleep, and disease risk\nCaffeine and disease risk \n\nWhile most evidence is associational from epidemiological studies, the evidence is mounting that coffee drinkers are less at risk to “a whole constellation of diseases”\nHowever, once you get past kind of like 3-4 cups, things go in the opposite direction\nSeems to be a very clear association between low-to-moderate caffeine consumption and de-risking health disease conditions \n\n*Caveat‒ caffeine can disrupt your sleep \n\nA lack of sleep is associated with an increase in the same diseases that are said to decrease in coffee drinkers\nEven knowing this, Matt says that he might be willing to encourage more coffee consumption if there is more causal evidence that emerges\nBut, caffeine can disrupt your sleep\n\n“The dose and the timing make the poison when it comes to caffeine”‒ Matt Walker\n\nIf you’re drinking it later in the day, you’re less likely to see those health benefits\n\nIn fact, you would likely see health detriments\n\n\n\nMore complexity to Matt’s hypothesis \n\nMatt’s thinking has been shaped after listening to the audiobook called Caffeine by Michael Pollan\nPollan believes that the health benefits are not really due to a cup of coffee, but the fact that the coffee bean itself carries with it lots of antioxidants \nAnd for many Americans who don’t get a balanced diet, coffee in the morning may be one of the only primary sources of antioxidant consumption which may explain the health associations\nA review paper from 2017 showed that decaffeinated coffee carries the same antioxidant load, but without the caffeine, and has many health benefits associated with it\n\nMatt’s personal behavioral adjustment \n\nHe now drinks decaffeinated coffee in the mornings\nHe’s still concerned about caffeine’s effect on sleep, even when consumed in the morning \nThis study showed that dosing people with caffeine at 7 AM lead to a reduction in the quality of that deep sleep\n\nGenetic differences amongst individuals \n\nThere are genetic differences in how quickly people metabolize caffeine\nSome people have very little sensitivity to caffeine, for example, and for those people caffeine in the morning is fine \n\n \nThe dangers of sleeping pills, useful alternatives, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia [1:19:45]\nFrom episode #58 – AMA with sleep expert, Matthew Walker, Ph.D.: Strategies for sleeping more, sleeping better, and avoiding things that are disrupting sleep; discussed from [1:24:30] – [1:45:00]\n“I feel very comfortable telling patients that I would rather you stick your genitals in a grinder than you take Ambien or Lunesta”‒ Peter Attia\nAmbien and Lunesta \n\nThese are sedative hypnotics and don’t actually get you into your good sleep stages\nThe FDA updated its mortality risk warnings regarding those sleeping pills because of this increased risk of death\n\n⇒ Study: Hypnotic drug risks of mortality, infection, depression, and cancer: but lack of benefit\n\nBut even more scary says Peter is the increased risk of chronic illness\nSleeping pills seems to weaken the immune system leading to higher rates of infection\nWeakened immune can increase cancer risk as well\nIn 2016, the American College of Physicians said sleeping pills must no longer be the first line recommendation for insomnia \n\nIt has to be something else called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)\n\n\n\nCBT-I \n\nPeter has had several patients go through CBT-I with “great success”\nIt’s a nonpharmacological, psychological method working with a therapist\nThey try to understand where your sleep problems are at and create a bespoke solution for you, the individual\nIt’s just as efficacious as sleeping pills in the short term\nBut the real benefit is in long term benefits\nWhen you stop sleeping pills, the benefit goes away, and you might have even made it worse (“rebound insomnia”)\nWith CBT-I, the benefits can last for years after stopping therapy\n\nHow do you recommend people find good CBT-I therapists? \n\nPeter recommends a sleep doctor Vik Jain in Chicago [now in Frisco, TX]\nHere’s a site to help you find a facility near you that is AASM accredited\n\nWhat questions to ask a potential sleep doctor? \n\nAsk them about their success rates\nAsk them where they have found problems with your patients\nWhich patients have you typically had the hardest difficulty with in terms of the profile of sleep problems?\n\nAnd if they sound like you, then maybe you want to look elsewhere as well\n\n\n\nTylenol PM and Benadryl \n\nFor Benadryl… \n\nBenadryl-induced sleep also has some of the risks associated with it that sleeping pills have\nIt’s less potent in terms of that bad consequence and outcome to sleep\n\n\nFor Tylenol PM… \n\nNot good enough data yet to suggest that it’s either good or bad\n\n\n\nWhat about low doses, or intermittent use of benzodiazepines? \n⇒ Examples: Xanax, Valium\n\nMatthew says be careful, only use it in the most dire of circumstances\nIt may have similar negative consequences as Ambien and Lunesta per one study by Dan Kripke \n\nEven just 3-18 pills per year can have a significant mortality risk\n\n\n\n“See how far you can really get with all of the other kaleidoscope of possibilities of sleep enhancing possibilities that we’ve discussed.  And if those fail, then I think you can think about last resources.  But those drugs typically just are not producing natural sleep.  So I would think of those medications like that box on the wall that says, ‘Break glass in terms of emergency.’  If you’re in that situation and you’re really struggling, then it’s possible that that’s the time to break the glass, but those shattered shards can sometimes still cut you.”‒ Matt Walker\nWhat about GHB and XYREM as a precursor? \n\nXyrem is a potent drug for people with narcolepsy\nMatt says that Xyrem or GHB are are drugs that appear to increase the amount of deep sleep that you have because it puts your brain into a more sort of sedated slow rhythm\nHOWEVER… a closely look in the lab shows it may not look like naturalistic sleep\nXyrem seems to be detrimental to sleep spindles\n",
