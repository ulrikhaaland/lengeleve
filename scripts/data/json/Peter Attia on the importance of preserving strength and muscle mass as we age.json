[58:00]\nHow much lean mass and strength are people losing by time?\nPeter is constantly communicating to his patients about the gravity of aging — just think about what  aging is robbing you of as time goes on? “You have got to fight like hell to avoid it”\n\nFigure 9. Strength loss with aging in literature (Keller and Engelhardt, 2013).\n\nThe lowest rate of decline that Peter could see is 1% per year\nAnother study showed 1.3% per year\nOthers are sort of putting it at one to 2% per year after 50\nLoss of 35 to 40% between age 20 and 80\nAnd the strength losses might even be greater\nSome studies even showing 4% strength loss per year\n\n*Peter’s important message*\n\nIt’s very difficult to put that in context when you understand what compounding does\nIt gives you a sense of what it means to sort of be average when you’re 50.\n\n“If you have the aspiration of kicking ass when you’re 85, you can’t afford to be average when you’re 50.” —Peter Attia\n\nEither through cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, or probably even muscle mass, to some extent, given its association with strength\nYou’ve got to be strong. You’ve got to have muscle mass to accompany that strength.\nYou’ve got to have the cardiorespiratory fitness\n\n",
