That’s really what defines the disease.”‒ Peter Attia\n\nAtherosclerosis is defined by the presence of cholesterol in the artery wall \n\nThis is not necessarily related to the measurement of cholesterol in circulation \n\n\nPatients with cholesterol in their arteries do not necessarily have to have co-aggravating factors such as: high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, family history, smoking\n\nAll these things that exacerbate ASCVD\n\n\n\nCholesterol explained \n\nCholesterol is an organic molecule, a type of lipid\nIt is not soluble in water\nIt is a hydrophobic molecule\nPicture pouring oil into water and you would immediately see what it means to have a hydrophobic substance in contact with something that is hydrophilic (water)\n\nThey repel each other\n\n\n\nCholesterol is about one of the most important molecules in the body \n\nYou would die without it\nRare genetic conditions that impair the ability to make cholesterol are fatal\nCholesterol is used for 2 main things:\n1 – The cell membrane of every cell in the body contains cholesterol\n\nCholesterol contributes to the fluidity of the cell membrane, important for membrane channels that allow things in and out of the cell\n\n\n2 – Synthesis of many hormones begins with cholesterol, including: cortisol, estrogen, testosterone\n\nIt is also essential for the creation of bile acids, necessary to digest food\n\n\n\nWhere does cholesterol come from? \n\nMost people think of cholesterol as something that comes from eating certain foods\n\nThis is true, eggs contain cholesterol\n\n\n But the cholesterol in your bloodstream has little to do with the cholesterol in foods you eat \n\nThe reason is, the cholesterol we eat in esterified, it has a chemical bond that swings between an intermediary oxygen and another side chain\nThis cholesterol is too large for the receptors in our gut to absorb\nMost of the cholesterol we eat is excreted\n\n\n\nMost of the cholesterol we will discuss in our bloodstream is made in our body and transported between cells through lipoproteins \n \nWhy early prevention of atherosclerosis is critical [13:45]\nFrom Peter on why early prevention of atherosclerosis is critical, a clip from episode #185 – Allan Sniderman, M.D.: Cardiovascular disease and why we should change the way we assess risk; discussed from [13:15] – [15:30]\n\nPeter remembers from pathology class in med school something the professor said, “No doctor has more experience with what it is to have heart attacks than pathologists because 50% of the people who have a heart attack die on their first heart attack.“\n\n50% of people who have a heart attack, their first presentation is death\nHe doesn’t think this is true today, but it was 25 years ago\nMaybe now 1/3 of first events are fatal, sobering nonetheless\n\n\nThe textbook went through, in great detail, the pathological staging of atherosclerosis\nIt was also littered with autopsy sections of coronary arteries from people who had died for other reasons\n\nNotably, many of these people died from other causes, but their coronary arteries were studied in autopsy; these people were quite young\n\nA 26-year-old male victim of a gunshot wound\nA 27-year-old female who died in a motor vehicle accident, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at their coronary arteries, one realizes they already have atherosclerosis \n\nThey have oxidized apoB-bearing particles engulfed by macrophages and thickened intima\nWhile they may not have calcification in their arteries yet or the types of plaque that would rupture within the ensuing weeks or days or months, they nevertheless had atherosclerosis\n\n\nNow what Peter’s professor said some 20 years earlier made sense\n\n ",

Is it resistance? We don’t have a clue”‒ Allan Sniderman\n\nTo Allan, it’s the same thing as much of the debate in lipids about apoB\n\nIt can be likened to the drunk looking for the key under the light because this is where the light is, not where he lost the key\n\n\nAllan thinks hypertension arises from the loss of elastins in the proximal aorta, and that causes systolic hypertension\n\nHe doesn’t think it’s complicated\nNow, what could accelerate this process?\n\n\nWhen Allan reads the literature on hypertension he sees studies on peripheral arterial tone, complex metabolic studies in sophisticated animal models, as well as some renal studies\n\nIt’s all miasma for him\n\n\n\nInvolvement of the proximal aorta \n\nThe proximal aorta is elastic; if one looks at a flow curve (a hydrostatic pressure curve) when a patient is young it’s rounded because as the left ventricle ejects blood rapidly into the aorta, the aorta expands and absorbs some of that energy\n\nRecall that wind castle that they’ve mentioned in school, but the energy is partially captured, partially regained; but the wall isn’t battered; the wall can give way \nImagine if those elastic fibers start to go, then the walls stiffen; now when the left ventricle ejects blood, the pressure goes up more rapidly and it falls more rapidly in diastole\n\n This could be why systolic hypertension occurs while diastolic pressure is normal \n\n\n\n",

Does that play a role in disease? \n\nAllan doesn’t understand endothelial dysfunction, but he knows the endothelium is critically important\nIt functions abnormally and how that fits into the overall pathology, he doesn’t know\nAllan bets apoB particles are part of the process inducing endothelial dysfunction, but he doesn’t know that clearly, experimentally\n\nDoes it make sense to compare hypertension to apoB? \n\nThey both seem to play a causal role in CVD\nIs one more causal than another or is that a silly question because they’re not binary and static?\nAllan thinks this is not the right question\nHe thinks our blood pressure goes up with age\n\nHypertension involves a large part of the population\nIt seems that hypertension is becoming part of the aging process\nHumans are lasting a lot longer than we were probably designed to\n\n\nThere is this repetitive injury to the proximal aorta, and it gets a little progressively less able to deal with it \n\nSo by the time a person is 50, somewhere around 60% have higher blood pressure (the figures are staggering)\n\n\n\nDoes apoB rise with age? \n\nIt does rise with age, but not that much\nIf you have high apoB at age 35, you’ve got about a 95% chance of staying high; 5% will go out of the high zone but they won’t go low, low\nIf you have high blood pressure at age 35, Allan wouldn’t expect anything is going to move you down \n\n“That’s why I think it’s [apoB] such a good signal for when we should start thinking about treating people”‒ Allan Sniderman\n\nSome people go from low toward high, but the majority don’t\nFor people with high apoB, about 90% remain high\n\nIs there a gender difference? \n\nPeter has seen women experience dyslipidemia as they go through menopause\n\nThis is something men men wouldn’t experience over that same decade or even a 5-year transition\n\n\nAllan notes that apoB goes up with menopause\n\nHe would like to see more data on this\nThe science has been held back because people don’t measure apoB\n\n\n\nAre we doing a better job treating hypertension than dyslipidemia? \n\nAllan has no idea\nThe incidence of coronary disease is going up in the last 5 years\n\nDespite statin therapy\nIt’s due to obesity and diabetes\n\n\nThere are many reasons why treatment is not succeeding as well as it should\n\nThe complexity of the lipid phenotype of the lipid model is part of the answer\n\n\n\nPeter’s takeaway: \n\nIf in the last 5-10 years the incidence of major adverse cardiac events is rising despite our advances, you could argue that measuring LDL-C and using it as our proxy for treatment is problematic\nAs dyslipidemia is growing in the metabolic context\n\nMeaning if you have more medicine, more insulin resistance, more type 2 diabetes\n\n\nWe know these phenotypes are associated with a greater discordance between apoB and LDL-C\nThis suggests you have a greater and greater portion of the population that is being undiagnosed or underdiagnosed\n\nBecause you’re treating their LDL-C and believe their risk is lower when really their apoB is higher [so their risk is higher]\n\n\nAllan agrees, “Trying to quantify lipoproteins based just on lipids is not adequate.
