    "content": "Show Notes*Notes from intro:\n\nRyan is a retired American long distance runner who holds the US record in the half marathon at 59 minutes and 43 seconds\nHe became the first US runner to break the 1-hour barrier\nHe also holds the American record in the marathon and is the only American to run sub 2:05, running 2:04:58\nRyan is generally regarded as one of the greatest American distance runners\nHe retired in 2016 after a really difficult 4-year period, following the London Olympics, which was plagued by lots of injuries\nHe’s really transformed his body in a way that is almost difficult to imagine without looking at a picture of him then versus now\nRyan now is a coach\n\nHe coaches his wife, who is also a professional runner, and he coaches runners of all category and talent levels through his training program called Run Free Training\n\n\nHe’s written a book called Run The Mile You’re In\nPeter remarks, “this is one of the few podcasts where I really felt like I came into it with kind of a sense of where I wanted to go and I completely came off that. I never really come into podcast with a list of questions, but I usually have a sense of direction and here I deviated from it completely. I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I think it just speaks to how much I couldn’t stop wanting to get into details of his training and just how intrigued I have been by his transformation.”\nRyan is an enormous physical specimen, probably over 190 lbs\n\nHe is into power lifting and carrying on many extreme feats of physical strength\nSome of which we talk about, but many of which you can see on his Instagram account, which Peter can’t recommend that highly enough\n\nIt’s just amazing to watch\nFor example, his last one was doing a 500 lb deadlift and then immediately running into a 5-minute mile\n\nHe didn’t succeed in that\nHe went 5:22 or something, but he’s going to take another shot at it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also talk about one of the most crazy of his fitness challenges that he does for himself\nToday he says his testosterone is about a 1000 ng/dL, which places him at about the 90th percentile\nObviously that’s a testament to how he’s changed his nutrition and the fact that he’s not running 110 miles a week.\nIn this episode, we talk about his career, but not in the necessarily in the most linear way\n\nHis amazing successes and his epic failures \nWhat he’s learned through these experiences\n\n\n\n“I think this is just kind of an amazing interview, even if you’re not a runner. But I think it really talks a lot about the mindset of what it means to be successful.” – Peter Attia\n\nRyan is just an incredibly optimistic person\n\nHe’s the kind of person who really never seems to let failure get to him in a way that maybe some of us certainly myself would\nPeter think’s his optimism is kind of what’s allowed him to bounce back from so many setbacks\n\n\n\n \nHow Ryan got into running and his formative years of training [4:45]\n\nPeter has been a fan of Ryan’s for a long time\nRunning is sort of like F1 racing\n\nIt’s not really popular in the US, but it is becoming more so\nThe Netflix series Drive to Survive has made F1 very popular\nPeople are starting to becomes more aware of runners\n\nKipchoge‘s two hour sub effort kind of got a lot of people in this country excited about it\n\n\n\n\nPeter’s interest in running began in the early 2000s\n\nHe use to swim with Allan Webb\n\nAllan was this phenom who set the high school record for the mile \nPeter often swam next to this guy, in the next lane and just became kind of interested in his journey \n\n\nThen Peter learned about Ryan Hall and the other runners of that generation\n\n\n\nGrowing up at altitude\n\nRyan grew up in Big Bear, CA; it’s at altitude\n\nIt was a really cool place to grow up\nIt’s 2 hours from the beach\nIt’s one of the few places someone can both surf and snowboard/ ski in the same day\nHe lived a mile away from snow summit\n\n\nMany of the best runners in the world come from places that are 7,000 feet altitude, such as Ethiopia and Kenya\n\nSo he found himself in the perfect scenario for a distance runner in the sense of being able to live high and train low\n\n",

    "content": "\nWhen he was growing up in high school, his dad was his coach\nHis dad started a cross country and track team just so he could run\n\nThere wasn’t even one available at Big Bear High School\nThe team would drop down twice a week, drive an hour down to sea level, get on a track at sea level, run some super hard interval sessions and then pop back up to altitude\nThis was before research and studies showed how beneficial this kind of training is\nBut they were doing it because it just made sense\nThis  was the environment in which he found himself in\n\n\n\nThe benefits of training the cardiovascular system during the formative years\n\nIt’s pretty crazy to look back on it now and see how things like that really did contribute to the trajectory of his path  \nPeter suspects there is something to being in that environment when you’re young, during the formative years of the cardiovascular system\nHe looks at his daughter who’s 13 and she loves volleyball and basketball, but doesn’t like cross country or track\n\nHe’s trying not to be a psycho about it, but he’s also telling her, “You have this really narrow window in which your cardiovascular system is quite malleable.” \n\n\nHe’s very fortunate that because he was involved in boxing when he was young\n\nHe had to do so much cardio, both aerobic and anaerobic training during those formative years\nEven though he’s a fraction of that level of fitness today, he can still ride on what he had then\n\n\nPeter thinks if one doesn’t push their system hard in the teenage years, it’s very hard to develop it later\n\nHe doesn’t know if this is true, but this is his impression\n\n\nTo be able to take this one step further with altitude is unbelievable\nRyan agrees that the effects of cardio at a young age definitely play on later in life\nNow, for example, Ryan is focused on strength training\n\nHe is just trying to get as big and strong as he can\nHis weight went up from 167 to 192 over 9 months\nHe was literally doing zero running, none; no other cardio, no biking, no swimming, nothing\n\nHe hopped on a treadmill at the end of that period when he was at his heaviest, just to see where his mile was at\n He was going to train for this challenge— he tried this 500 lb deadlift into a sub five minute mile\nHe hopped on a treadmill after his weight session— 5:18 for the mile, with zero training\n\n\n\n\nRyan thinks when someone develops their cardio early on, later, they just need little touches here and there\nHe takes pretty short rests between a lot of his lifts and he thinks that’s enough to keep him in 5:8 mile shape without even trying\nThere are lots of interesting things about how the body develops\n\nKids who are born at altitude and how they have greater potential for cardio-development over time\nLooking at his family, he’s in the middle of 5 kids\n\nHis youngest brother, Chad is super into endurance stuff\nAnd he was born at altitude, where Ryan was born in Seattle, Washington\nHis family moved to Big Bear, CA when he was 5 (elevation 6,772 ft) \n\n\nHis brother was a really good runner\n\nHe won the national championships in high school cross country\nHe went to Oregon on scholarship \n\n\nBut between Ryan and him, there’s not a huge difference in their top end potential for cardio\n\n\n\n \nThe advantages of altitude—living high and training low [9:45]\n\nPeter thinks it is important that he became interested in looking for ways to improve his training, in the years when he was a swimmer\n\nHe looked at the matrix of living high, living low, training high, training low \nAnd coming up with what was the optimal scenario\nThere is a clearer answer to this today than there was 20 years ago\nToday, the answer is crystal clear— best results are attained from living high and training low, when it comes to intensity\nIt is important to live high and train high for low end aerobic efficiency\nBut one has to train that anaerobic peak at sea level\n\n\nPeter remembers swimming up in Colorado Springs at the Olympic Training Center as a guy who lived at sea level\n\nHe would go there for camps and try to push it hard in Colorado; this was a total waste of time\nThis was the exact opposite of what to do\n\n\nHe had friends who lived at sea level but they would sleep in oxygen deprivation tents to replicate living in altitude, so they could train at sea level",

    "content": "\nHow Ryan grew up was the perfect way to do this; they accidentally discovered the efficacy of living high and training low\nRyan notes that it felt good; anytime he would pop down to sea level to do track workout, it was as Peter described\n\nThis was different from training at altitude, running 400 meter repeats on short or longer aerobic efforts \nOr trying to do the mile reps super fast at altitude\nThe workouts have to be structured different at altitude\n\nHe does a lot of intervals when training at altitude, just to break things up\nFor example, he would run a bunch of 200s on really short rest\n\n\n\n\nAt sea level, one can spend a lot of time at race pace, working on that turnover, which just can’t be done at altitude without breaking it up more\n\nGoing down to sea level for workouts felt really good, it worked, and the results were obvious\n\n\nHis wife Sara is a professional marathon runner, she grew up at sea level in Santa Rosa, CA\n\nShe’s run 2:20 for the marathon, which is the second fastest ever by an American\n\n\nThinking of altitude, there is also the effect of how many years someone has spent in altitude\n\nFor example, he is super good at altitude in terms of running\nHe can run pretty close to his sea level times at 7,000 feet altitude for a marathon\n\n\n\nMarathon training [12:30]\n\nOne of the most important things about marathon training is someone’s threshold\nFor a 15 mile threshold, he just runs 15 miles at the marathon intensity\nHe could run 12, 15 miles at 4:48 per mile, which is about marathon pace at 7,000 feet\nIf he pops down to sea level, maybe he runs a 4:42 pace, 4:40 pace, but he didn’t get a huge conversion from altitude to sea level\nWhereas someone like his wife, Sara, who wasn’t as accustomed at altitude, she’ll get maybe 20 seconds a mile where she’s running that much slower at altitude than she would at sea level\n\nBut she’s gotten better as she’s spent more time at altitude \n\n\n\nBenefits his wife, Sara, has seen living at altitude\n\nThey moved to Mammoth Lakes (elevation 7,880 ft) out of college after they graduated from Stanford in 2005\n\nShe hated living in Mammoth, at 8,000 feet for such a long time\nBut gradually over time, she’s gotten much, much better at altitude\nProbably still not as good as he was when he was in his prime, but now they have to even go up to higher altitudes to get similar effects to what they were getting before\n\n\nThey have a place in Crested Butte, Colorado, where they’re sleeping at 9,400 feet\n\nEvery time she goes up there, they see a massive jump in her fitness just from doing a month up there\n\n\nOne has to keep playing with it because the science is there and his experiences are true, but also the body is dynamic\n\nThe body is always changing\nOne just can’t repeat the same thing over and over and over again\nThe body is always changing, always adapting\n\n\n\n \nProgressive overload, blood flow restriction, and switching up your workout routine [14:15]\nThe importance of switching-up training to see growth\n\nThat’s a big thing he’s learned lifting weights; if he’s just doing the same lifting all the time and not trying new mechanisms to add weight to the bar, or different tactics, he’s just not going to see growth\nThat is the fun of running, training, lifting— it’s all a giant experiment; he’s always tweaking little variables\n\nHe loves to see growth\nHe loves the frustration of not seeing growth, of getting black toes and thinking “What is going on right now?”\nHis mind will chew on this for months, and he’ll make little tweaks until he finds it\n\n\n\n“Then you find it, and bang! It clicks, whether it’s in the weight room or running all of a sudden you’re doing what you couldn’t do before” – Ryan Hall\nProgressive overload\n\nPeter notes that progressive overload is one of the hardest things to do when one is training themself, as most people are\n\nMost of us we’re just weekend warriors and we’re sort of our own coaches and it is very easy to get comfortable\nThe challenge of being able to progressively overload doesn’t always mean weight; it can mean sets, reps, reduction in rest time\n\n",

Right?\nThe reason Peter put this sign up in his office was because he was put off by the notion that people would say, “Hey man, we’re training for a marathon, not a sprint”\nHe tried to make the point that if someone wants to win a marathon, it feels like sprinting \n\n\nIt’s one thing to go out and run a marathon and take hours to do it\nIt’s another thing to go out and win a marathon\nIf someone is trying to win a marathon, they have to understand the pain that these guys are in\n\nThey have to understand what 4:42 means; it is insanity\nFor Ryan, it’s below his threshold, but his threshold is so high\n\n\nFor Peter, looking at Meb win that race, having seen him in the months prior, running so fast doing tempo repeats while Peter was on his bike, it is really amazing\n",

Ryan Hall’s record time for the North American half marathon. Image credit: Way Back Machine\n\nPeter asks how old he was when he started running\nRyan was 13 years old\nPeter read somewhere that his first run was around Big Bear Lake, a 15 mile run; he asks “How much did that hurt?”\n\n“Oh, it was the pain train the whole time. There was no magic to that run.” – Ryan Hall\n\nHe was suffering the whole time\nHe was wearing basketball shoes\nHe had no idea what he was doing\nHis legs just felt like they just got pounded into a million little pieces halfway through it\nHe had to stop multiple times\nHe stopped at a liquor store and got a SOBE drink\nHe stopped to ice his legs\nIf his dad wasn’t there, he probably wouldn’t have made it around the lake\n\n“But that was such a learning experience for me now as a dad of, for myself being like, how do we respond to our kids and their crazy ideas?” –  Ryan Hall\n\nHe thinks about this crazy thing he decided to do when he was 13 and what it did\n\nIt changed the trajectory of his entire life\nIt all started with some crazy idea\nIt would have been very easy for his dad to suggest that he start with a 2-mile run instead of a 15-mile run\nBut that wouldn’t have captured him in the same way\nHe needed a hook to be forever changed, something big\nHe’s so glad his dad didn’t gun down his ideas but supported him to go and do it\n\n\nPeter can’t imagine the pain; he had a similar experience when he was 12\n\nHe woke up one day and just wanted to go run 5 miles\nHe wanted to see how fast he could run 5 miles\nHe put on his crappy shoes and went out and ran 5 miles\n\nIt hurt so much\n\n\nThe next day though he wanted to do it again\n\nSo he did it again and it hurt so much\nAnd again on the 3rd day, and it hurt so much\nThen on the 4th day it changed; he felt awesome\nThen he never stopped; he just started adding more distance\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe mental aspect of training and the power of reframing negative thoughts [37:45]\n\nRunning is very nonlinear\n\nThe pain he was feeling at 5 miles; this is a quarter of the distance of 13 miles in terms of effort\n\n\nPeter wonders what was going on in Ryan’s mind at the 5 mile mark, at the 8 mile mark\n\nDid he love the pain, love proving to himself that he could do it; or was he thinking “why am I doing this?”\n\n\nRyan notes, “the thing about distance running is… what’s going on in your head is hugely important”\nNow when he trains athletes he tells them “you got to have a whole bunch of different arrows essentially that you can pull out and use. Cause sometimes you use one thing, it doesn’t work; you’ve got to go to something else.”\nHe has all these different tactics and managing pain and discomfort, but honestly, one of the biggest ones that is most helpful is simply turning the mind off\n\nTurn the mind off and keep putting one foot in front of the other\nIt sounds so simple and basic\nBut in the last 5K of the Boston Marathon when he is in a world of pain, there are no profound thoughts going on in his mind\n\nIt’s as simple as putting one foot in front of the other as fast as one can\n",

If you’re going to perform well, you’ve got to be excited about how you’re doing…  find something to get excited about in that moment” \n\n\n\n\nRyan talks a lot about like reframing things in one’s mind\n\nThis is one of the most helpful things he does all the time\n\n\n\nThe Grand Canyon “farmers carry” challenge\n\nFor example, he was doing a crazy challenge he calls chop wood, carry water\n\nHe splits a cord of wood at his house in Flagstaff, and then drives to the Grand Canyon\nHe runs down to the bottom of the Grand Canyon, holding these 7-gallon water jugs\n\nThey weigh about 62 lbs each when they’re full\n\n\nIt’s a 10K (6.3 mile) run down to the bottom of the Grand Canyon; it drops 5,000 feet\nHe gets to the Colorado river, fills them up and farmer-carries them out of the Grand Canyon\n\n\nHe remembers being down at the bottom and filling up those jugs and just looking up at the trail he had just run down \n\nHe thought, “what did I get myself into?” \nThe sun was already getting down super low\nAnd that was the hardest part of the whole challenge for him was just starting back up\n\nBecause he knew what was waiting for him; how far he had to go\n\n\n\n",

But this farmer’s-carry thing is ridiculous.”\nRyan agrees, it was a crazy experience\n\nHe had to reframe a lot\nHe initially thought it would take him 4 hours to carry these out; his goal was to beat the sun\nBut it was already 3 or 4’oclock when he got down to the bottom\nHe found himself getting frustrated about how it was going\nThoughts of, “I’m never going to get out of here” were going through his mind\n\n\n\nThe power of accepting and reframing negative thoughts\n“I had to reframe it and come to peace with what was happening out there and just accept it and then get excited about it” – Ryan Hall\n\nHe was looking at the moon coming up; it was so epic\nIt was dark\nHis buddies were there cheering for him, giving him food and water and stuff\nIt was just such a beautiful experience\n\n“But I had to reframe it to be able to see it that way because how I was seeing it at the bottom of the canyon was like, oh man, this is going to suck, what I get myself into; I don’t know if I can get out of here” – Ryan Hall\n\nOnce he was able to accept all those negative thoughts and then reframe it, then he was able to embrace this really beautiful experience\nThis was one that was life changing for him\nOne that he’ll never forget; getting to the top of that canyon and putting those jugs down \n\nHow good it felt to finish \n\n\n\n“But I had to kind of like change how I was thinking about the whole situation, which is what you have to do when you’re in a race and it’s not unfolding… how you want it to unfold.” – Ryan Hall\n\nThis is something Peter can relate to on a number of his swims where things didn’t go well\n\nRyan is right, there is something about saying, “I’m not going to quit; I’m going to put my head down and I’m going to do this”\nWhen one gets to the other end, it’s pretty remarkable\n\n\nOne of the things Peter learned from watching other swimming coaches is— when a swimmer says they want to quit, don’t let them do it\n\nTell them to give it another 10 minutes then talk about it again\nHe makes them do this 3 times\nPart of it is just to show them that they can swim for another 30 minutes\nSo maybe if one can swim for another 30 minutes, then they could probably swim another 4 hours or whatever the time is\nHe acknowledges their desire to quit and after 30 minutes, that is fine, they can\nBut there is no substitute for the feeling one has when finishing \n\n\n\nRyan’s pace during the farmers-carry up the Grand Canyon\n\nRyan’s challenge strikes Peter as the hardest physical thing he could ever imagine doing\nHe asks what kind of pace Ryan was at, a slow jog?\n\nIt was basically a fast walk\nHe wanted to make his legs and heart do as much of the work as possible\nJust holding  that much weight in ones hands becomes an issue\n\n\nThis was harder than running a marathon because during a marathon his heart rate is around 167\n\nIn this challenge it was probably 195, 197\nHe has a really low heart rate to begin with\nHe couldn’t get it over 200\nWhen he was at his fittest, his resting heart rate was 27  \nNow it is nowhere near that\n\n\nThe first 17 or 20 miles of a marathon feel pretty good\n\nHe’s conversational\nHe’s floating along; it’s just fun; he’s enjoying the ride\n\n\nThis challenge was like doing interval training\n\nHe was going into his 32nd carry, set it down, take as minimal rest as possible\n",

It’s about how I do what I do.”\n\n\nHe went through this season experimenting with some new styles of training that he had never done before\n\nNew stimulus is always helpful for the body\nHe had always been in the same routine, doing the same structure training\n\n\n\nStructure of workouts with the Mammoth Track Club in 2010 \n\nPeter asks about the structure of his workouts in the 2010 Mammoth days\nOn a typical week, Ryan would do intervals on Tuesday\n\nThis was working on that 5K-specific speed, things like 6 by mile, 10 by K, 800 meter repeats, 400 meter repeats\n\n\nNow he has gravitated more toward shorter distance repeats— 400s, 200s, things like that\n\nHe thinks this is more important for marathoners because one wants a lot of differential between how fast those Tuesday intervals are compared to the Thursday/Friday threshold\n\n\nPeter asks, before Ryan left the Mammoth Track Club, were his 1-mile or 1K repeats a set of 10 by a km or 6 by a mile?\n\nWhat was the warm up\nWhat was the first thing he would do when he arrived at the track?\n\n\nFirst, he would do an easy 20-minute jog around \n\nThis was at an 8 minute mile pace; he would be conversational the whole time, not breathing hard\n\n\nThen come back and do some dynamic flexibility or maybe some static stuff\n\nThere was not a lot of static stretching\nStretching has not been a huge part of his running at all\nHe wants some tension in his legs\n\nThe leg muscles are springs; a tightly wound spring is going to respond to the ground quicker compared to a slinky that’s super slow\n\n\nHe wants a full range of motion so he would do lots of mobility work to get that full range but still keep some tension in the legs \nSo he would spend 5-10 minutes on drills and strides\n\nThe strides are maybe 6x 100 meters\nThis is all on his Run Free Training YouTube channel\n\n\n\n\nThen he would change into his racing shoes and go straight into the workout\nPeter asks, if he’s doing the 6 by a mile, how fast would he run that mile?\n\nIf his half marathon pace was 4:32 and his marathon pace was 4:42 to 4:45, how much faster does need to run that mile?\n\n\nIf he was doing it at altitude (7,000 feet), he would typically run around a 4:30 pace\n\nAt sea level, this is equivalent to 4:20 or so\n\n\nSo the 6 by a mile and the Ks, that’s more of a 10K-specific workout., but he’d gravitate more towards 5K specific stuff, a little bit quicker\nHe would keep the rest fairly short; within the mile he would rest 90 seconds to 2 minutes\n\nAt altitude, he would rest a little bit more\nBut as you get fit you recover super fast\nThe intensity was not like doing max sprints; that requires a 10 minute break between springs\nWhen sprinting in a 10K range, ideally you are running at an effort you can hold for 10K and you’re stopping at a mile; you’re not killing it\n\n\nPeter asks if he is walking or standing still during this recovery\n\nSometimes he’s doing a slow walk-jog, it depends\n\n\nHe likes doing in and out intervals too\n\nThat was one of Prefontaine’s workouts, where he would do 200 meters fast, 200 meters moderate",

We don’t go for walks or hikes or do anything. It’s just train, eat, sleep, stay off your feet. And you’re always aware of that energy expenditure. You’re trying to save as much as you can for your training.”\nPeter remembers in high school, growing up in Canada, they had a lot of amazing Jamaican runners, sprinters\n\nThey used to tease each other saying, “Look, we are the laziest people you will ever meet. And if you want to make us run faster, just put a couch at the finish line. Whoever can get to the finish line first gets to lay on that couch”\nBut it was hard work; these were super intense workouts\n\n\n\n \nOptimal body weight for competition and the pros and cons of going below your natural weight [1:48:45]\nIntense training is hard on the body\n\nPeter notes that cyclists have to work hard and deliberately restrict calories\n\nOften they would show up to huge stage races like the Tour de France, the Giro, the Alta, calorie depleted\n\nThey are trying to be as light as possible\nEverything comes down to this 1 metric— watts per kilo\n\n\n“If you lined up all the cyclists at the beginning of the Tour de France, and you could know what everybody’s threshold was in watts per kilo, that would predict the order they would finish, barring a strategic mishap or an injury or an accident”\n\n\nRyan agrees, his lifestyle and training was very specific\nTraining at that level wasn’t the most healthy lifestyle; it wasn’t optimal for his health\n\nHis testosterone level was clinically low every time he tested it— in the 100’s, 150\nPeter notes, this is the level normal for women\n\n\nRyan wonders how one can run so fast with such low testosterone\nPeter remembers his testosterone was in the 220s when he finished residency, and this was low due to sleep deprivation etc\n\nBut in the 100s is staggering low\n\n\nRyans testosterone level would come up after a 2-week break\n\nThe pros and cons of low body weight\n\nThinking of weight, Ryan is 5’ 10” and his weight got down as low as 127 lbs\n\nHe noticed his running got worse if he was less than 137 lbs\n\n\nPeter compares this to cycling and talking to Lance Armstrong\n\nLance’s race weight was 160-165 lbs; he’s 5’ 9-10”\n\nThat’s a lot of weight for a guy who is such a good climber\nNow the GC contender probably weights 140 lbs\n\n",

I’m going to make the most of it.”\nHe always likes to go to the front and lead; this was his signature",

You might never be here again. Why don’t you just put your head down, grit your teeth and bear it, try to break five and get under 2:05?”\nAnd so that’s what he did\n\nAnd it was a world of pain\nThat last mile is a blur\nThe crowds in Boston were just insane\nHe’ll never forget running down Boylston Street, and the crowds just going crazy\nHe was in fourth place, but he didn’t even care because his performance shifted away from beating other people, to maximizing his own potential\n\nAnd that’s what he get most excited about\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s about me optimizing what I’ve been given, my gift. And also just seeing the fun part of the growth and the improvement.” – Ryan Hall\n\nComing across the finish line, he just put his hands out and soaked it all in, yelled super loud\nHis wife was there at the finish to give him a big hug, and it was a super special moment\nHe felt he’d won the race even though he hadn’t\nBut it was one of those magical moments (like Houston) that you may never get again\n",

It’s the way in which you’ve been able to kind of carry yourself through the failures.”\nThere is this parallel between ’07 and ’08; and then again in ’11 and ’12\n\nIn how he was feeling going into London\nThe expectations early in that season were very high \n\n\nRyan agrees, coming out of a 2:04, he was going to take a shot at winning this race, even though he’d just been beaten by a minute by those guys\n\nHe knew he wasn’t expected to necessarily win, but he knew he had a shot\nIf you run 2:04 for the marathon, in those days, you have a chance to win a gold medal\n\n\nTalking about not putting on the weight after he ran London, this was a theme going back to Beijing\n\nLeading up to the buildup for Beijing and he did the same thing; and it made his training run flat\nThis is where having a coach is a helpful thing\nIf he would’ve told a coach what he was going to do, the coach would say, “That’s a really bad idea. Let’s just stick with what we know works for you in this situation. And that’s putting on 10 pounds.” \nBut instead of doing that … his heart was good, his intentions were good\nHe really wanted to hear God, and a way that people across all traditions do this is through fasting\nSo instead of putting on 10 pounds, he did a 1-week fast\n\n\n\nPreparing for London and lessons learned about not depleting his body\n\nPeter asks how close this was to the Olympics\n\nBoston was April 15th; the Olympics were in August\nThere was enough time for him to get a full buildup for the game\nHe had plenty of time to put on weight and do his usual thing\n\n\nBut he wanted clarity on how to train for this thing\nSo instead of his weight going from 137 to 150 during that 2-week period, it went from 137 to 130 flat\nHe started the training in a really depleted state\n\nHis body wasn’t in a good state\nMentally and spiritually, he was in the best spot he’d ever been\nBut his body wasn’t ready to go at all; it needed a break after that\n\n\nHe began his training and was running pretty well initially, but it went downhill from there\nIt became a miracle that he even made it to the starting line, considering how poorly his training was going\n\nJust nothing was working\n\n\nAnd this is what he tells himself in the weight room all the time now\n\nWhen he’s getting stale in training and not seeing growth\nIf he’s not taking in enough calories; it doesn’t matter how he’s training, it’s not going to work\n\n\nThat’s how it was for him in that buildup, his body was depleted\n\nHe didn’t have enough calories on board\nIt was a frustrating period of training leading up to that\nHe took his watch off for all his workouts because it was so discouraging to see how slow he was running compared to what he was accustomed to\nIt was helpful to get away from the data but it wasn’t enough to get his body back into the state it needed to be in\n\n\n\nOptimism at the start of London but injury leads him to drop out\n\nHe’s a very optimistic person, so he’s pretty good at generating hope, and there was some genuine hope at the starting line in London\nSometimes training can go really badly and then, pop, you can have one big day\nHe always has the thought that something special could happen today\nBut early on in the race the pace felt super hard, super fast\n\nThis is often the case when he gets too lean and too light; then he has injury issues\n\n\nLuckily his chiropractor, John Ball, had him in one piece at the starting line\nBut early in the race his right hamstring started hurting, and that’s ultimately what led him to drop out as I was in the middle of that race\n\nHe was already starting to limp a little seven miles into the race\nHe had to be smart, because this is his livelihood, and he’s looking out for the long term",

    "content": "\nAntarctica was nice because running on the snow doesn’t beat up your legs; it’s a little bit softer\nHe also used the most cushy shoe he could find because he knew his legs were going to take a beating\nHe weighed around 170 at the time\n\nMiami\n\n3rd they flew to Miami and that was fun; it was like a homecoming back in the states but also warm\nHe had more trouble with this one\n\nMaybe he ran Miami at 3:30 or something\n\n\n\nSpain\n\n4th they flew to Spain\nHe had the words day ever in Spain\nLuckily one of his Dutch friends came over and rode his bike with him on this run\n\n“Even when I was running professionally running can be your best friend and your greatest enemy all at the same time” – Ryan Hall\nMorocco\n\n5th was Morocco for Africa\nThey got a hotel room for that one\nConsidering how bad he felt in Spain, his goal was to start out super chill and just make it through this one\n\n“The mystery of running, why you’d all of a sudden feel so good? I have no idea, but I just started feeling like a million bucks.” – Ryan Hall\n\nHe started out chill but started feeling good, like his old self\n\nHe was mentally super engaged, he started charging, and came home super quick\n\n\nHe ended up running this one around 3:04\n\nWhich for zero training was really good\n\n\nFrom then on he was pumped\n\nDubai\n\n6th was Dubai\nThe problem after Morocco was he developed a bit of a limp; his hip was bothering him\n\nHe thought he could shake it off\nBut in Dubai his hip was on fire and he knew something was really wrong\nHe ended up walking the back half of that marathon\n\n\nHis time was probably over 4 hours\n\nSydney\n\nLast they headed to Sydney to finish in Australia\nThe whole thing was crazy\n\nThey were on a private jet with food, movies, everything\nHe didn’t watch 1 movie the entire week\nWhenever he was on the plan he was asleep; he was so tired\n\n\nWhen they landed in Sydney he tries to stand and put weight on the leg where the hip was bothering him and the pain took his breath away\n\nThe pain was super sharp\nHe knew he was in trouble\nHe had a hard time putting any weight on it at all\n\n\nHe was also sick of all the tiny things you do as a pro runner\n\nMobility stretching, etc\nHe wasn’t doing any of this\nHe didn’t wear compression socks the entire week\nWhen he got to Sydney his ankles looked like elephant ankles, they were so swollen\n\nIt was actually painful\n\n\n\n\nIn Sydney he put on the same singlet he wore at his first marathon in London in 2006 or 2007\n\nHe was thinking, “this is my last marathon…this is my goodbye tour”\n\n\nHe went in with the same attitude he had for his 15 mile run around Big Bear\nHe wanted to go out with a bang\n\n“I never got to say goodbye to the sport. It’s like, I just faded out. And all of a sudden I was gone and my body wasn’t able to run.” – Ryan  Hall\n\nThis was his chance to say goodbye to the sport that he loved\nThe last marathon was at Manly beach\n\nThey did a mile out, mile back for the whole marathon\nIt was sick, the beach was lit up by the moon and the stars\nThey were running at 1:00 am for some reason\nHe would have rather gotten more sleep\nHe thinks Richard scheduled the run at night was to give people enough time to finish\nHe needed the extra time that day\n\nHe got a massage in the middle of the run\nWhen he got home and had a MRI he found out he had a stress reaction in his hip\nMassages aren’t the best for a stress reaction\n\n\nHe’ll never forget coming across that finish line\n\nThe sun was up\nIt took him 5.5 hours\nIt was the longest, slowest, most painful marathon\nEvery time he put his leg down on that concrete he felt the zing of a super sharp pain\nBut after running 6 marathons in a row he was like, “I’m doing whatever it takes to get through this seventh one. I’m not stopping now and never signing up for this trip again. So I got to get it done.”\nHe came across the finish line, took off his shoes and left them there",

It was so life altering for me and the most beautiful part of all of it was the people. Meeting my wife, my kids, all the people I crossed paths with continue.” – Ryan Hall\n \nReflections on what running has given Ryan [2:49:30]\n\nThe people he met are what he holds most dear from that experience\nWhat’s cool about it is that it doesn’t matter what level you run at\nWe all get to experience that when you sign up for any race \n\nYou’re out there with a 50,000 amazing people that are on a journey with you \nWe get to do it together\n\n\nThat whole sentiment just hit him super hard; saying goodbye to the sport he loves\nBut then, it’s been such a beautiful transition though of realizing that that whole season was about seeing how good he could get\nSince then he’s realized it wasn’t just for him\n\nEverything he’s learned in that season was meant to be passed down \nIt was meant to be shared and meant to help other people\n\n\nThis launched him into the season coaching\n\nCoaching his wife, coaching other athletes in person\nHe started Run Free Training where he coaches runners of every single discipline\n\nEvery level\nSuper slow people\nMiddle school kids\nBecause it doesn’t matter where you’re at, we just want to be on the journey with you and we want to guide you and help you on your journey\n\n\n\n\nSo it was really special to realize that even all the mistakes that he made, they weren’t for naught\n\nHe’s on this podcast, he’s able to share it with the listeners \nAnd hopefully they won’t make the same mistakes and they’ll be better off for it\n\n\nThat is his goal now— how he can help people\n\nNot just with running but with living\nLiving happier\nHe’s far more concerned with his athletes happiness than with how fast they are\n\n\n\n“I want them to enter into the good life. And I think running is a way to do that. Lifting can be a way to do that, it adds to that, but more than anything I just want them to find joy.” – Ryan Hall\n\nPeter comments that he would love to meet Ryan in person\n\nThey would have fun lifting together\nHe would love to try some of the crazy challenges Ryan has done\n\nHe wouldn’t be able to do the farmers-carry up the grand Canyon with a fraction of the weight Ryan used\nThis is something he could see wanting to do one day\n\n\n\n\nThe Grand Canyon is an amazing place\n\nPeter has only been there once, but it’s still one of the most significant things he’s ever done\nWhen he was there, he made it a hiking / swimming trip\nHe swam in the Colorado river and then in each of the waterfalls on the way up\n\nThere are thes 4 huge waterfalls that get progressively smaller as you go up\n\n\n\n\n\n",
