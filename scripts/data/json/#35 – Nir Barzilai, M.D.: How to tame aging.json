Group 3 lived 20% longer than Group 1\nThere was also an increase in healthspan in Groups 2 and 3. \nIn other words, it was clear that the removal of visceral fat was beneficial, all things equal, and that caloric restriction was found to be the most beneficial in terms of lifespan in rats.\n\n",

But Nir showed that mammalians live longer if you surgically remove the visceral fat and make them insulin sensitive.\nHow Nir made sense of this paradox:\n\n\n\nOnly so much glucose can be stored in the muscle so the muscle becomes IR as a protective mechanism, and so the excess glucose goes to the liver (because it at least has the capacity to turn glucose into fat) and to the fat cells\n\n\n“So what am I telling you? I’m saying that insulin resistance is a protective mechanism. It’s a modulator, it’s a stress response. . .So now, I understand why a stress response mechanism in one animal causes them to live longer and in another animal, it’s a pain in the butt.”\nNir wrote a review with Luigi Ferrucci looking at all the animals with IR who live longer, and all the animals who were IS but lived shorter, that tries to explain this paradox\n\nMaking sense of the term “insulin resistance”\n\nPeter asks Nir what he means when he says insulin resistant/insulin sensitive\nAlways referring to the muscle? Are you referring to the liver?\nGenerally, he’s referring to everything, IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate) and IRS2\nIRS1 and IRS2 are everywhere, but IRS2 is more in the liver and brain\n\nHow does the muscle take in glucose?\nPeter’s hypothetical: A person gets a bolus of glucose which doubles blood glucose from 90 to 180 mg/dl, what is the chain of events that leads to insulin being secreted, and the muscle ultimately disposing of that glucose, both actively or passively?\n\nSecretion of insulin relative to the glucose bolus\nThe GLUT4 transporter is moved from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane\nThe GLUT4 transporter then tells the cell to uptake glucose\nThis happens quite passively meaning it doesn’t require ATP to bring it in was the translocation has occurred \nAnd it has its own intrinsic activity that’s not yet energy dependent, so it can go faster or slower by different ways\n\nCan we get glucose into muscle without insulin?\n⇒ Exercise enhances non-insulin glucose uptake\n\nPeter has a fascinating patient with Type 1 diabetes\n\nIncredibly strict diet and a huge appetite for exercise\n“Never seen a higher level adiponectin or sex-hormone binding globulin”\nHe only injects 6-8 units of insulin (very little)\nYet his hemoglobin A1C is below 6 (very low)\n\n\n\n⇒ Brain can take over the whole insulin process\n\n“We can do things to the hypothalamus and take over this insulin and muscle and fat and liver, we can do it all from the brain.”\nNote: one of the main functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary system\nThe liver provides another example. . .\nYou can do a hepatic vagotomy, which means you are severing the nerve that connects the CNS with the periphery,  and everything that you did through the brain doesn’t work anymore because it needs the nerves . . . “it’s through the nerves and not through a chemical reaction on the liver”\nPeter laments, “You see, this is the problem with metabolism, Nir.

    "content": "\nPeter defines IR in the muscle: “So we will define insulin resistance at the muscle, whether it be from an aged phenotype or a diabetic phenotype, as a scenario under which a fixed amount of insulin hitting the insulin receptor produces fewer GLUT4 transporters, is that a fair definition?” \nNir rebuts by explaining that the simple, clinical definition of IR is all about the ability of insulin to clear glucose, but admits that it “totally misses the point because those insulin levels have different effects on different tissue”\n\nThe following is a hypothetical example comparing two patient’s response to an oral glucose tolerance test. . .\nPeter’s OGTT protocol with his patients\n\nTakes baseline glucose and insulin levels\nGives patient 75 g of Glucola\nMeasures glucose and insulin (and FFA and c-peptide) at 30, 90, 60, 120 minutes\n\nHypothetical, let’s say they both start with 90 mg/dl of glucose and insulin of 6 IU\n\nBoth at 1 hour have a rise in glucose from 90 to 130\nBut one of them did it with a rise in insulin from 6 to 20\nAnd the other one with a rise of 6 to 90\n\nWould Nir describe them at both as equally insulin sensitive?\n\n“It’s complicated. . .the rise in insulin is changing throughout normally physiology and throughout individuals. And you might’ve missed some of the insulin peaks earlier on, or later on.”\nPeter’s hypothesis in this hypothetical is that the one who needed 90 units of insulin to dispose of glucose with the same efficacy as the person who needed 30, is sooner, rather than later, going to have a harder time disposing of glucose\nNir says that there’s another possibility: \n\nIt’s possible that the people who are more insulin sensitive will be first to get other macrovascular diseases, like heart attacks or stroke\nSo the IR people may get diabetes first, but the insulin sensitive people may get macrovascular diseases first\n\n\nPeter says, “Which brings it right back to the observation of glucose versus insulin, micro versus macrovasculature…”\n\nHow does insulin signaling work to get glucose into the liver? \n\nLiver uses GLUT2 to get glucose into liver\nThis transporter is always on the membrane and it doesn’t require insulin to move it there\nImportant in evolution because if the liver is denied glucose you only have a few minutes to live\nNir says that the main role of the liver is to produce glucose\n“That would be my answer, too,” says Peter\nBut this is further complicated when you consider the following example:\n\nElderly people in certain cases have enough insulin to suppress glucose production, but not enough insulin to increase glucose uptake\nSo when you look at baseline glucose, they will look healthy\nBut when they are fed, they fail and become glucose intolerant and diabetic\nAnd this is because the liver is more sensitive to insulin than the muscle. \n\n\n\nMetformin as a possible anti-aging drug [48:45]\nWhen did Nir first realize metformin could be an anti-aging drug?\nStudies by Vladimir N Anisimov showing an increase in lifespan and healthspan with metformin in animals\n\nAnisimov also showed that there’s a significant effect on insulin (10% effect in animals, rapamycin has a 24% effect by comparison)\nSo there’s a milder effect than rapamycin, but in every study, they show that healthspan is improved by 50% (so the effect on longevity was less than the effect on health)\nThree studies that gave it also to nematodes and they also lived longer\n\nThe moment that Nir knew he had to do a study of his own (his TAME study):\nAfter reading this U.K. study Bannister et al. in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism from 2014\n\nCompared 78,000 newly-diagnosed, diabetic people on metformin to 78,000 people non-diabetic people not taking metformin\nThe diabetic patients on metformin were more obese than the control\nThey also had more disease than the control\nBut there was 17% less mortality in the metformin group\n“When you get less mortality with metformin when the setup is diabetes, that really shows that metformin has a very important effect in humans as far as aging”\nPeter says, “that’s a pretty god damn staggering result”\n\n",

It should be selectively dosed to target complex 1 [mTORC1], leave complex 2 [mTORC2] alone.” says Peter\n\nNir and his TAME study was featured on an episode of Ron Howard’s show, BREAKTHROUGH, called The Age of Aging\nChallenges of getting TAME started [1:01:00]\nThe FDA’s lack of interest in diabetes\n\nNir approached them about a study to determine metformin’s effect on cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes\nBut FDA said they’re not interested in diabetes\nPeter is stunned, and says that the FDA is taking a short view of diabetes, “The short-term cost burden of diabetes is relatively trivial, but it’s that long-term cost burden that becomes quite elaborate.”\n\nSo the major challenge is: How do we define aging in a clinical study?\n\nNo biomarkers, and with all the diseases the major risk is aging\nWe’re all going to succumb to chronic disease, our genetics and environment will just determine which one we get first\nWe age biologically in different ways so we don’t know what the next disease an individual is going to get, but the point is that they are trying to prevent that next disease\n\nBias against composite outcomes\n\nNir says, “I’m agnostic. It doesn’t matter what you come and what you’re going to have, I’m going to prevent whatever it is. That’s why we have a composite.”\nPeter rants: “This pisses me off to no end when people get all bent out of shape about how you can’t have a composite outcome. And this is the bias against aging, really. Because in the end, what matters is how long are you alive, and how long is your healthspan optimized.”\n\nThe NIH wants Nir to study the chronic diseases separately\n\nNIH thinks Nir is crazy to think that one drug can target aging\nTheir main concern seems to be cancer\nThey suggest that Nir do three studies looking at cardiovascular, cancer, and dementia separately\nBut Nir takes issue with that approach, “The significance is for the cluster [of diseases], not for the individual disease, and if you tell me to do individual disease, I need triple the budgets, and I’m not going to get to the FDA with the indication for aging.”\nPeter says, “The biggest challenge here is not the funding. It’s not the study design, it’s the conceptual leap. It’s a completely different paradigm of how we think about delaying death.”\n\nWhere does the TAME study stand today?

And so it begs the question, why would it concentrate in centenarians as opposed to just rise commensurate with the population?”\n\nWe show cross-sectionally that Lp(a) drops until the age of 80 (by half) \n“It’s killing you, until it’s not”\nIt should be flat, so why is it increasing? ⇒ “Because it’s a protected aging gene”\n\nCETP VV mutation\n\nMost of the people with high Lp(a) that are centenarians are also CETP VV mutations\nWhat does the lipid panel look like for someone who is CETP VV plus or minus LP(a)?\n\nHigher HDL levels\nLarger lipoprotein particle size\nAnd they have lower CETP levels (Low CETP has been protective against several age-related diseases, the most dramatic is cognitive decline)\n\n\nPrevalence of the CETP VV mutation: At 55 [years old] it’s 8% of the population and at 100 it’s 20% of the population\n\nDifferent Lp(a) phenotypes? ⇒ Peter’s hypothesis\n\nPeter asks, “Why wouldn’t Lp(a) flatline after age 80? In other words, I understand why CETP VV is protective. I don’t understand why Lp(a) should concentrate.”\nPerhaps there are different phenotypes of the Lp(a)\nMost people with high Lp(a) die of premature heart disease, but a significant number do not\nThis makes Peter wonder, “are there virulent and nonvirulent phenotypes that at the level of expression by number, or molecular weight, that are not captured?”\nIf so, the next question becomes…\n“Is the nonvirulent one the one that is concentrating in the centenarians?”",

[2:05:30]\nPeter is often asked by patients, “Should I be on growth hormone?”\n\nHis answer is “I don’t think so, but if I’m gonna be brutally honest, I really don’t know.”\nBecause the clinical data certainly don’t give us the answer\nSo the epidemiology, if you’re in Valter Longo’s camp, says taking GH would be the worst thing you could ever do because “growth hormone is bad because IGF is bad.”\n\nhow can you manipulate IGF?\n\nManipulate growth hormone exogenously, \nmanipulate IGF dietarily predominantly through amino acids, \nand manipulate insulin to indirectly impair or enhance IGF binding proteins.\n\nNir just published a paper in Nature a month ago\nNir’s been trying to develop antibodies against the IGF receptor (IGF-1R) because IGF-1R is expressed in many cancers\nNir’s hypothesis about IGF: you need to decrease IGF action in the periphery, but increase it in the brain\nNir did a longevity study:\n\nGave the IGF-1R antibody to 22-month-old female mice that are 70, 75 years of age equivalent\nThey increased their health span dramatically and increased their lifespan by 9%\n\nMale and female difference: “The interesting thing between male and female, the difference, is that the female mice that were treated with the IGF receptor antibody had a lot of inflammatory markers when we started. They were 22 months. And those inflammatory markers were really decreased with aging. In males, we had a little bit more inflammatory markers, but they increased with the IGF treatment.”\nNir’s final take on giving GH to patients: “So I’m telling you from human studies, from genetic studies, I’m telling you growth hormone treatment is not beneficial. It should be dangerous for elderly people. For elderly women. With men, I’m ready to say that I’m not sure. It’s not that I’ve shown that low IGF or growth hormone is better in males. Not in my rodent studies and not in my human studies. But it’s hard to say that giving growth hormone is bad. \nPeter thinks the most obvious way to manipulate IGF is through fasting\nAbout once a quarter, doing a one-week water-only fast:\n\nPeter goes from about 180-200 at baseline\nAt the end of the fast, it’s 80-90\nSix weeks later, it’s 140-150\nA cyclic approach may be better than a chronic calorically restricted approach\n\nThe CALERIE study appeared to show that CR didn’t decrease IGF levels\n\nNir also realized that in his rats, he was actually intermittently fasting them because the rats would eat all of their allotted food\nSo they would eat every 23 hours\nIn the CALERIE study, human subjects ate throughout the day and didn’t have any large periods of fasting\n\nBack to metformin: \nNir’s small clinical study trying to tie the animal data to the biology of humans\n\nThey studied 14 ~70-year-olds in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial where they were treated with metformin and placebo for six weeks each\nMetformin lowered 2‐hour glucose, insulin AUC, and insulin secretion compared to placebo\n647 genes were differentially expressed in muscle and 146 genes were differentially expressed in adipose tissue\n\n“While each tissue had a signature reflecting its own function, we identified a cascade of predictive upstream transcriptional regulators, including mTORC1, MYC, TNF, TGFß1, and miRNA‐29b that may explain tissue‐specific transcriptomic changes in response to metformin treatment. This study provides the first evidence that, in older adults, metformin has metabolic and nonmetabolic effects linked to aging. These data can inform the development of biomarkers for the effects of metformin, and potentially other drugs, on key aging pathways.”\n \nNAD and NAD precursors (NR and NMN) [2:30:00]",

Actually, it has a side effect that it also can prevent a lot of other diseases in the world.” \n\n“I think the prevention of aging is really a good place to be and I think because we went from hope to promise and we have to realize the promise. I think life is going to be very different in the next decade with our advances.”\nPossible blind spots in Nir and Peter’s thinking? [2:43:00]\n\nThere are several interconnected pillars of aging\nWhen you start to fix or improve any of those pillars, it starts to improve the others as well\nBut where they could be wrong is that most of the data is animal data so “we don’t know what is the impact of each of those pathways in humans”\nBut the advantage of aging is that it is universal\nWhen you give metformin or rapamycin to any animal, it almost always delays the aging\n\n“So I don’t think we’re going to be wrong. . .some [pathways] will be harder to treat, but I think we have to affect three, four and we’re right on our way. . .and that’s just the beginning.”\n§\n \n",
