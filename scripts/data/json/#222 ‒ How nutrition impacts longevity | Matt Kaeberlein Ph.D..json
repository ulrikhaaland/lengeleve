My goal is that you come away from this realizing that there’s quite a bit of uncertainty here, but I have a better way that I can think about it and I have a better sense of what questions to ask.”\nFor those of you who may not remember who Matt is, or maybe even didn’t listen to any of our previous podcasts, here’s a really brief reminder\n\nMatt is a globally recognized leader in a basic biology of aging\nHe’s a professor of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology and an adjunct professor of Genomic Sciences and an adjunct professor of Oral Health Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle\nHis research interests are focused on the basic mechanisms of aging in order to facilitate translational interventions that promote healthspan and a healthy way of life \n\n\n\n \nChallenges with understanding the effects of nutrition and studying interventions for aging [3:30]\n\nPeter remarks, “I don’t think a week goes by that we aren’t exchanging an email about some aspect of the relationship or the interspace between nutrition and longevity.” \n\nQuestions‒\n\nDoes that speak to our ignorance? \nDoes that speak to the ubiquity of such content? \nWhat does that say about us?”\nMatt’s take, “Having been in the aging field for a long time, I certainly recognize how complicated that biology is. And I think the biology of nutrition is equally complicated. And when you get at the interface of those two it’s really hard, I think, sometimes to draw definitive conclusions.”\nHe also thinks this will be a little bit of a theme‒ there are many things we don’t understand yet about optimal nutrition and how that intersects with optimal health span\nPeter and Matt have spent a lot of time on the podcast speaking about molecules that may protect against aging: rapamycin, and more recently‒ NMN, NAD, and Metformin\n\n#10 – Matt Kaeberlein, Ph.D.: rapamycin and dogs — man’s best friends? — living longer, healthier lives and turning back the clock on aging and age-related diseases\n#175 – Matt Kaeberlein, Ph.D.: The biology of aging, rapamycin, and other interventions that target the aging process \n#207 – AMA #35: “Anti-Aging” Drugs — NAD+, metformin, & rapamycin\n\n\nIt’s almost easier to ask these questions from the standpoint of geroprotective molecules because the intervention is much cleaner\nJust yesterday, Peter, Matt and David Sabatini had a back and forth about rapamycin‒ timing of the dose, frequency within the dosing schedule, the dose itself\n\nEven with a drug this can be complicated\n\n\nThe benefits of a drug are still trying to be pieced together, imagine putting this together for the topic of food/ nutrition\nMatt adds, “The big piece that gets lost with the animal models on top of all that complexity is the environment”\n\nIn animal studies, the mice are kept in a well controlled environment, relatively pathogen free, and they live in that same environment their entire life\nCompare that to the human experience where our environment is extremely complicated, and it changes throughout life\n\n\nAlso, the epidemiological studies on optimal nutrition are from 20, 30, 40 years ago\nThe average human environment is very different today than it was when those studies were done\n\nHow does that potentially change the interaction between nutrition and health outcomes?\n\n\n\nDifficulties of studying interventions for aging\n\nPeople age very slowly\nPeople in their 70s today were in their 30s 30 years ago, and that environment was different than today’s environment\n\n“I think the key is to recognize that limitation and be potentially even more careful about assuming causation from correlation over many decades”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \n \nHow Peter’s and Matt’s convictions on nutrition and thoughts optimal health have evolved [8:15]\nHow Peter’s convictions on nutrition have changed over the past decade:\n\nHis convictions have become looser as time goes on\nHe views fewer and fewer things with certainty\nClinically, Peter views nutrition from a very simple 2×2 framework \n\n\nFigure 1.  2×2 clinical framework for viewing nutrition. \n\nPeople are not distributed equally in these buckets\nThere are not many people who are adequately muscled and undernourished\n\n\nYou can’t sort someone into a bucket by looking at them\n\nYou need to do some functional testing and look at their biomarkers\nThis might include a DEXA scan\n\n\nIt’s important to sort people into a bucket to answer the questions‒\n\nDo you need an energy deficit? \nDo you need an energy surplus?\nWhat’s your protein intake need to be to achieve that in combination with your calorie needs?\n\n\nBy far, the hardest to treat is the “over nutritioned, under muscled”\n\nUnfortunately that’s a very common phenotype\n\n\nMatt agrees with this approach and adds, “There’s no one size fits all… and it’s is an ongoing learning process”\n\nIt’s really important that we be willing to change our beliefs about nutrition and other aspects of health as more data comes in\n\n\n\nProblems with the changing advice of nutritionists\n\nMatt remembers when he was in his early 20s, he read a diet guru book that promoted the theme of eating anything you want as long as you cut out the fat\n\nThat you could have this really high, simple carbohydrate diet just as long as you kept the fat low, you’d be fine\nNow we know that’s exactly wrong\n\n\nHow do we know that 10 years from now we’re not going to look back at what the diet gurus are saying today and be like, “That just makes no sense.”?\n\nFinding optimal health, actionable steps, in face of confusing science [12:15]\n\nMatt says: It’s not that nutrition science across the board is low quality, it’s just a really hard problem\n\nThere are really good scientists doing really good work in this area\n\n\n\nTo some extent, the biology of aging and the biology of nutrition share that‒ these are extremely complicated biological systems we’re trying to understand in the context of this changing environment over time\n\nIt’s important to recognize what the limitations are and not draw really strong conclusions such as‒ everybody should eat a low protein diet\n\n“That’s a mistake to recommend across the board nutritional strategies for everyone”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \nMatt’s perspective on optimum health \n\nIf you can be somewhere close to optimal nutritional intake (just say total calories and body composition is somewhere close to where it should be), that’s a big chunk of what you need to give yourself the best chance of being healthy going forward\nYou don’t have to optimize every single thing\nStarting from that big picture perspective allows you to get most people most of the way there\nAnd then when they’re most of the way there you can focus on how do we get that last 10, 20, 30%, whatever it is\nPeter agrees and adds, “There are most things in his life where he doesn’t like the 80/20 principle… but for nutrition get 80% right, complete optimization is not worth it”\n\nHis good friend, Tim Ferriss is the king of this‒  “How can I get 80% of the learning with 20% of the time?” and Peter has never seen anybody who can do it like Tim\n\nTime can learn a language in a month\nPeter is the opposite, he’s the guy who loves the tail, he loves the asymptote, he love the perfection of something\nBut for nutrition, he is the opposite\n\n\n\n\n“It’s instead better to put your energy into exercise” says Peter\n\n“You have far more of an ROI on the exercise front than eeking out incremental value on the nutrition front”\nPeter and previous guest Layne Norton have had riffs on this back and forth \nPeter notes there is a vocal group of people on Twitter who will waste endless hours debating the finer points of their dietary pet peeves but can’t do 10 pull-ups\n\n\nNutrition matters, but as David Allison once said, “It’s amazing how little we know about this subject matter” \n\nAnd for most of our existence we were worried about the too little problem\nThe too much problem has become a relatively recent phenomenon\nAnd they’re bad in different ways, acutely, chronically, they have different limitations\n\n\n\n \nCalorie restriction for improving lifespan in animal models [16:15] \nEarly studies in model organisms \n\nFrom the animal literature, caloric restriction seems to reproducibly improve lifespan\nThe first experiments were published in the early-mid 1930s (so they probably started in the 1920s)\n\nPeople have been looking at this for 100 years\nEarly studies were all in rats\nStudies were designed from a developmental perspective, concerned with malnutrition\n\n\nFindings of early studies of restricting calories during early life/ development of rats show‒\n\nSmaller body size\nLifespan increases by 40-50%! (living their whole lives in the laboratory)\nRats also seem to be healthier as they live longer\n\n\n\n“So this concept of health span and the period of life that is spent in good health free from disease and disability, it seemed as if caloric restriction was not only increasing lifespan but also extending health span”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \n\nThese results led to studies of caloric restriction in both rodents (rats,  mice) and simpler organisms (invertebrates)‒ fruit flies, C. elegans, and yeast\nThe common theme in these results is restriction of nutrients can increase lifespan and apparently healthspan too\n\nThere is a lot of nuance there we can dive into and unpack but this is the general take home message\nThis was found over and over again, across a great evolutionary distance\nCaloric restriction seems to slow aging\n\n\n\nWhat causes natural death in old laboratory mice? \n\nEvery old mice will have cancer at their time of death\n\nAn estimated 75-80% of lab mice would die of cancer\n\n\nMost are euthanized before they reach this endpoint\nThey are not dying from atherosclerosis (the leading cause of death for humans)\n\nTheir arteries are not littered with plaques the way ours are\nThese are inbred mouse strains\nMice do develop functional declines in every tissue and organ as they age (much like people do)\n\n\nA legitimate criticism of the interpretation of the caloric restriction literature‒ what this is really doing is preventing cancer?\n\nThis may account for the lifespan effect\n\n\nBut caloric restriction also seems to delay or outright prevent declines in tissue and organ function\n\n \nUtility of epigenetic clocks and possibility of epigenetic reprogramming [22:00]\nFunctional measures of aging and the utility of “clocks” \n\nPeople in the field are really enamored with aging clocks, epigenetic clocks, and biochemical markers\nMatt thinks these are useful, but more so would be showing that the heart is still functioning like a young heart\n\nOr the immune system in an elderly individual is still functioning like it does in a young individual \n\n\nThere are lots of type of clocks\nWhen most people use this term today, they mean an epigenetic clock\n\nThis relies on changes in epigenetic marks, changes in the genome that occur with age\nIn every organism where it has been studied, characteristic changes are seen in the epigenome with age\nThis can provide a good chronological measure of aging",

    "content": "\nThese clocks might have value in forensics‒ analyze the DNA evidence to see how old the perpetrator is\nIn the dog aging project, this could be used to determine the age of a rescue dog \n\n\nMatt is not convinced that epigenetic clocks (and other types of clocks) are actually measuring biological aging\n\nThis is hard to prove\nThis field is in flux\nThe proof is being able to show at an individual level (mouse/person/dog) that you can predict their biological age at some point in their life and with some precision, predict what’s going to happen in the future\n\n\nWe really want to know for the individual‒ \n\nWhat are their future health outcomes\nHow long are they going to live\n\n\nLongitudinal studies in people have taken samples 10, 20, 30 years ago and measured epigenetic profiles then ask, “How well does that correlate with mortality outcomes in the future?” \n\nThey work to some extent\nPeople debate how well they work and if they are better than other markers for predicting mortality\n\n\n\n“I’m a skeptic by nature and I want to actually see the proof”‒ Matt Kaeberlein\n\nA word of caution‒ some people in the field talk about changing the epigenome as if it will change everything about aging, but there is no data to support that\nWhat we know know about the biology of aging is that epigenetic changes are 1 of 8-10 molecular processes that seem to contribute to aging (that the field has reached consensus on)\n\nSo epigenetic changes is only 1 of those processes\nIs there a hierarchy?\nIt’s possible that it could drive a lot of the other changes but we don’t have data to support this\n\n\n\n“So this idea that reversing the epigenome is reversing aging is at best an exaggeration, at worst an outright lie. I mean, it’s just not true.”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \nHow could you test the role of epigenetic changes in aging in mice? \n\nMatt thinks we’re conceptually close\nThere are these 4 factors called the “Yamanaka factors” that can reprogram the epigenome\n\nIf you take cells in culture, in a laboratory and you passage them many, many times you can see changes in the epigenome, just like you might see changes in the epigenome in an animal, in tissues\nYou can put these reprogramming factors into the cells and turn them on and they basically wipe clean the epigenetic changes that have happened over time\nThey can restore those cells back to a pluripotent state that can differentiate into any cell type\n\n\nMore recently, people are trying to express these reprogramming factors in an animal\nThe most compelling work is in a premature aging model of mouse (the progeroid model)\n\nThese mice are very short lived (maybe 25% of the normal mouse lifespan), very sick\nThese reprogramming factors can extend the lifespan dramatically, maybe 50%\nThese are impressive changes that are consistent with the idea that you fixed or made something better\n\n\nThe NEXT experiment would be to express these reprogramming factors in an old mouse and make it young again\nAnother experiment shows improvement in 1-3 tissues\nMatt is most impressed with work from David Sinclair’s lab, where they use this optic degeneration model \n\nThey showed they could reverse degeneration of the eye with these factors\nThey tried to do the same thing in an old mouse but the data was mixed\nTo some extent they could regenerate the optic nerve in an old mouse\n\n\n\n“That’s certainly impressive, exciting, but nobody has ever taken an old mouse and turned it into a young mouse”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \n\nMatt is convinced it could be useful therapeutically\nHe would really be excited if somebody could do as good as rapamycin in a mouse\n\nCan reprogramming match the benefits of rapamycin? \n\n1 – Rapamycin can extend lifespan by at least 25%\n\nBut the dose has not been optimized\n\n\n2 – Rapamycin can reverse functional declines in many tissues\nThis hasn’t been done by reprogramming with these factors yet\nMatt remarks, “Show me you can take a two and a half year old mouse, make it look like a one year old mouse and then it lives to be five years old, I’ll be really excited… But I think the enthusiasm has just gotten so far ahead of where the science is.”\n\nHow does epigenetics relate to DNA? \n\nThe DNA is where all the information is, but then that DNA has to get turned into RNA, that’s called transcription or gene expression\nAnd then that RNA has to get turned into protein and in general it’s the protein that does the work.\nSo what these epigenetic changes, the methyl groups that sit directly on cysteine residues in the DNA do primarily, is affect expression of the genes \n\nSo basically what you’re seeing with aging, we think, is a shift in the epigenome that leads to certain genes being expressed that shouldn’t be and certain genes not being expressed that should be \n\nMatt thinks there’s a little bit of a debate about which is more important right now but it probably doesn’t really matter, right? \nThe idea is you’re getting things turned on and turned off inappropriately as we get older \nSo there’s a loss of regulation, which probably contributes to a loss of homeostasis \n\n \nMutations and changes to the epigenome with aging [31:45]\nHomeostasis is a useful way to think about aging \n\nIf you’re healthy, your body is generally in homeostasis\nAs we get older, it becomes harder and harder for our body to maintain homeostasis\nWhen you get out of homeostasis, if your defense mechanisms are working right, you can get back in\n\nIf you get COVID for example, your immune system works, you’re out of a homeostasis but you come back in and then you’re okay again.\n\n\nAs we get older it gets harder to come back into homeostasis and that’s why we start to see pathology and mortality\n\nWhy does our ability to heal decline with age? \n\nPeter compares how long it takes a cut to heal for his 5 year old son and himself\n\n2 weeks ago his son was on a scooter, going down the steepest hill in the world\nHe face planted, and when he came up all Peter could think is, “How quickly can we get to the hospital?”  \nIt was a bloodbath, but 6 days later there was 1 tiny scar, 9 days later you would have no idea he ripped his face on the pavement\nPeter (age 50) gets a cut, and it takes 9 months until the scar is gone\n\n\n\nPeter’s takeaway‒ “There’s a very clear distinction between a five year old’s DNA and a 50 year old’s DNA in terms of how he can literally make new proteins that are better than my proteins”\nWhat is the difference in their DNA?  \n\nWe know mutations accumulate as we age\n\nHonestly that’s what drives a lot of cancer\nWe have know this for a long time\n\n\nThe epigenetic changes are on top of this \nPeter wonders how much that factors into the example he just gave\n\nMat is sure it does to some extent\n\n\nPeter asks, “What else explains why his collagen’s so much better than mine?”\nMatt thinks there are probably many reasons\n Inflammation is a huge driver of our loss of ability to recover as we get older\nAll sorts of things go wrong if you have a high level of sterile inflammation in your body, including the ability of stem cells to function \nA lot of injuries require stem cells to function, to build back what’s been broken\nPeter asks, “Could it be that I have more senescent cells and more senescent cell factors that are impairing the ability of cells to heal?”\nJust to throw a wrench in that, there’s actually a body of thought that senescent cells actually promote wound healing\n\nAgain, this is where the biology’s so complicated\n\n\nMatt thinks the crux of the question they started from is if you only fix the epigenome, do you fix everything?  \nThe fair answer is‒  nobody knows\nHe would be shocked if epigenetic changes drive all of aging, but it’s possible\n\n“I think we have to be open to that idea that epigenetic changes sit on top of, or upstream of the other hallmarks of aging.”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \n\nYou will not fix mutations by fixing the epigenome\n\nThe question is, do mutations happen with enough frequency to be a major contributor to functional declines that go along with aging \n\nMutations certainly contribute to cancer\n\n \nEpigenetic reprogramming: potential benefits and downsides and whether it can work in every organ/tissue [35:15]\nWhat is it about reprogramming that we think is going to fix an aging neuron or an aging cardiac myocyte? \n\nSome tissues are rapidly turned over (gut  epithelium, fingernails, hair), but others do not (neurons, cardiac myocytes)\nHeart failure is also a big problem\nThis is an area where the biology of what’s really happening is poorly understood\nThe real answer is, “We don’t completely know”\nA simplistic answer is, people are trying partial reprogramming\n\nThey are not reprogramming back to a pluripotent state, that would be dangerous\nIn a single celled organism, it’s no problem to go back to the pluripotent state and start over\nIn a complicated animal, if we reprogram you back to the pluripotent state, it’s not going to end well\n\n\n\nThe idea is to go back far enough that you restore the epigenome to its pristine state, young state, and then hope that when you do that, you restore gene expression to where it’s supposed to be \nPotential benefits of epigenetic reprogramming \n\nMaybe one way to think about it is you restore the homeostatic mechanisms to a more youthful state where then the homeostatic mechanisms that all of our cells have can basically clean up the rest of the mess\nWe know as we get older, for example, we all accumulate damaged mitochondria \n\nChanging the epigenome (which is the nuclear genome) isn’t going to fix anything that’s wrong with your mitochondria directly\nBut maybe by fixing the epigenome, you restore the homeostatic mechanisms that then maintain mitochondria in a healthy state and you can fix the damage to the mitochondria\n\n\nThe evidence is suggestive that if you do it just right, you can improve function in at least some aged tissues/ organs by partial reprogramming\n\nMatt has yet to see anything that convinces him, that anybody has made an old heart into a young heart in an old animal with partial reprogramming in the heart\nBut you can improve function\n\n\nThe same thing’s true with rapamycin‒ short term treatment with rapamycin in mice makes an old heart function more like a young heart\n\nHe would never argue that we have taken that old heart and made it young\n\nWe don’t know that, and that’s hard to prove\nYou can see some evidence that it should be possible with partial reprogramming to do that\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question is: Will epigenetic reprogramming work in every tissue/organ? \n\nWe don’t really know\nMaybe we will see really large effects on lifespan and healthspan in mice\nHow do you do that in the brain?\n\nBecause so much of who we are and what we are comes from our experiences and our memories\nHow do you ensure that you can reprogram somebody’s brain in a way that isn’t going to change that? \n\n\n\n“My big concern is that we don’t mislead people into thinking that we’re close to reversing aging”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \n\nThinking that we are close to reversing aging is a problem from the perspective of the general public\nIt’s also a problem from the perspective of the scientific community\n\nSome scientists look at this and think, “This is snake oil.  This is just not true.”\n\n\nPeter’s concern is people think this will be available in 10 years and use this to do whatever they want because they can be reprogrammed later… that’s very risky\n\nPeter’s answer to this is, “Guys, you can do both. You can believe that in 10 years, we’re going to fix this problem, but you could still actually care about your health.” \n\n\nMatt notes, “I think you can just look back over the last 20, 30 years and look at predictions people made on how fast these things were going to come along and get into the clinic. And none of that has happened. So I totally agree with you.” \nHe also takes a view of strong skepticism when people say “This is going to happen in 10, 15 years.”\nHis advice is, “Don’t expect major changes in treatments to improve lifespan and healthspan in the next 20 years”\nThis doesn’t mean he’s not optimistic\n\nHe thinks there are opportunities there\nIt wouldn’t sur0ise him to see some of these things make it to the clinic, but he doesn’t expect it\nThere are so many barriers that we don’t yet appreciate… barriers in moving things through clinical trials\n\n\n",

And again, it’s remarkable that that information isn’t out there and most people in the general public don’t know that… The magnitude of the benefit compared to the effort that you put in, I think most people just don’t know that.  And it’s unfortunate.” \n\n \nImpact of calorie restriction on the immune system, muscle mass, and strength [47:00]\nWhat do we know about the effect of caloric restriction (CR) on the immune system of laboratory animals? \n\nIt’s complicated and there are several confounding factors\n1 – Laboratory animals are kept in what’s called a specific pathogen free environment\n\nThat doesn’t mean there’s no pathogens\nBut it’s a relatively low pathogen environment where they are not obligated to really use their immune systems against all the challenges that we would face in the real world\n\n\nOne question has come up‒ are animals that are on caloric restriction immune compromised?\n\nThe data is mixed\nSome studies on pathogen challenges on CR animals show they respond better than age-matched ad libitum fed control animals\n Ad libitum just means these animals get to eat as much as they want\nSepsis experiments show that CR animals die much more quickly than controls\n\n\n2 – This gets complicated by the question of optimal nutrition with CR\n\nSome studies use CRON (caloric restriction with optimal nutrition) \nOr CRAN (caloric restriction with adequate nutrition)\nThis can be controlled in mouse studies, we can make sure they get all the micronutrients and vitamins that they need when they’re on this CR diet\nThat all goes out the window when you move into the real world and people start practicing caloric restriction\nMatt comments, “If I wanted to do caloric restriction off the top of my head, I wouldn’t even know what to do to make sure that I’m getting optimal nutrition.”\n\n\n\nIn the state of CR without optimal nutrition, that’s where you really worry about side effects, particularly immune deficits\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re aging more slowly if you get influenza and die\nMatt becomes really worried when we start talking about recommending these nutritional strategies to the general public, based solely on mouse studies\n3 – Humans live in greater environmental complexity than laboratory mice\n4 – Humans have greater genetic complexity/ diversity than laboratory  mice\n\n“There’s all sorts of things that are just different about laboratory animals compared to people living in the real world”‒ Matt Kaeberlein\nHow does frailty (sarcopenia) change in an animal in a CR environment? \n\nMost functional measures of aging seem to be preserved in calorically restricted animals\n\nThis includes measures of frailty and sarcopenia\n\n\nThe same is true with rapamycin \n\nThis surprised a lot of people when these studies were done\nBecause mTOR plays such a big role in muscle synthesis, the thought was that if you inhibit mTOR with rapamycin or CR, you would see accelerated sarcopenia\n\nThis was not observed in laboratory animals\n\n\n\n\nThe important complication here is that all of the caloric restriction studies Matt’s aware of‒ when they look at muscle function, they normalize to body weight\n\nAn calorically restricted mice weigh 30-35% less than ad libitum fed mice\n\n\nPeter notes that grip strength is normalized to weight\nIn calorically restricted mice, they have maintained muscle function proportionate to their body weight\nApply this to a hypothetical person‒\n\nYou’ve got a 60 year old person who needs to lose 30% of their body weight, but of course you want to maintain their muscle mass, their muscle function\nWould you view it as a good thing or a bad thing if they lost 30% of their body weight AND 30% of their strength?\n\nPeter doesn’t think this would be good\nIf they needed to lose 30% of their body weight, presumably their body composition isn’t great to begin with\nThey may be better than when they started\nOptimal might be to lose 30% of body weight but disproportionately lose adipose tissue\nThis might mean losing 10% of strength (or none), depending on the change in lean body mass\n\n\n\n\nMatt explains this is a complication of CR studies, it’s difficult to figure what normalization they did to look at metabolic rate, or muscle mass, or lean mass, or fat mass, or muscle function\n\nUsually these studies will be normalized to body weight\n\n\nThis problem comes up in some of the intermittent fasting studies\n\nThe question is are they isocaloric, or are they calorically restricted when they’re put on intermittent fasting? \nAnd people will claim they’re isocaloric, but the mice lose weight\nBut what they really are is  isocaloric WHEN normalized body weight\n\nSo they’re really calorically restricted\n\n\nBut to understand this, you have to dig to get how the normalizations were done\n\n\n\nOnce you achieve an optimal weight, is additional CR beneficial for longevity? [52:50] new section? \n\nThat makes the assumption we know what optimal weight is\nMatt thinks that’s the crux of the question, “We’re asking, does CR impact longevity positively?” \nWe know if you go on CR you’re going to lose weight\nSo if the answer to that is yes, then by definition, optimal weight is lower than what we think. Right?\nMatt thinks about this from the perspective, “What are the downsides potentially to caloric restriction? And if we don’t know that caloric restriction has big benefits in terms of healthspan and perhaps lifespan, what are the downsides? And do those downsides outweigh the uncertainty we have about whether caloric restriction is beneficial?” \n\nPeople in the field have not paid attention to this \n\n\nWe all expect if you do a clinical trial of a drug, you’re going to report adverse events, and you’re going to look at side effects\nVery rarely do people think about that before they write a book recommending that people should do diet X\nEven in some of the nutritional clinical trials, they don’t really carefully monitor adverse events\n\nIt’s a bias in the way we think about interventions, where we feel nutritional interventions are, by their very nature, safe and certainly for extreme nutritional interventions, that’s clearly not true. So I think we should be thinking about what are the risks associated with significant caloric restriction in people as a therapeutic strategy. \n \nInsights from famous calorie restriction studies in rhesus macaques [55:00]\n\nPeter has read the caloric restriction study at the University of Wisconsin and the NIA (National Institute on Aging) 1000 times\n\nThis is the experiment to end all experiments with regards to CR\n\n\nThis was a huge NIH funded effort that ran for a couple decades, given the lifespan of rhesus monkeys\nThere are 2 groups of animals\n\n1 – At the University of Wisconsin\n2 – At Bethesda, Maryland at the NIA\n\n\nThe Wisconsin animals (both controls and CR) were fed a very processed diet\n\nAt least after the fact, the investigators there suggested they wanted to more mimic a standard American diet\nThe amount of sugar, pure sucrose, in their diet was 28.5% of total calories\nThe CR animals were fed 30% less than what the control animals were fed\nIn that experiment, they found a benefit to caloric restriction‒ \n\nThe CR animals outlived the control animals and had fewer age-related diseases\n\n\nThe original paper in 2009 showed a compelling effect on lifespan\n\nBut this might have been due to reduced rates of cancer\n\n\nCR animals had fewer age-related diseases\n\nThe dietary composition and caloric restriction had a beneficial impact on the aging process\n\n\n\n\nThe experiment in Bethesda may have not been deliberately different but the DIET was different\n\nThese animals were actually fed the closest diet that could mimic their real diet\nIt didn’t have any sugar in it, only about 3% sucrose\nIt was almost a vegetarian, pescatarian diet\nFish was the dominant source of protein\nIt was a high quality diet relative to the Wisconsin animals\n\n\nThe complicating factor in Bethesda was the animals didn’t come in at all the same age as they were in the Wisconsin study\nThe net result of the Bethesda study was there was no difference\n\nThe CR animals did not live longer\n\n\nSo while the Wisconsin study published in 2009 said, “CR works” the NIA study published in 2012 sais, “CR doesn’t work”\n\nHow do you reconcile the opposite findings of the Wisconsin study and NIA/ Bethesda study? \n\nThe NIA study at Bethesda did show some improvements in health span metrics, so CR did not extend lifespan but appeared to have some beneficial effect on healthspan\nSince the NIA study came out, they had a reconciliation paper to try and figure out why they got different results \n\nTheir conclusion is that a lot of it comes down to the difference in diets\nIf you look at the actual body weights of the animals and how much food they ate (not just the composition), you could make an argument that the Bethesda control monkeys were somewhat slightly calorically restricted\n\n\nThe Bethesda study was a little less controlled for age of onset of CR, some of them were older when they started CR\nThere were some genetic differences in the animals used in Bethesda too\n\n“There’s a combination of factors that make it a little bit difficult to conclude that it all is about the diet”‒ Matt Kaeberlein\n\nIt’s interesting because we see this a lot of times in basic science studies, where different labs get different results in what seems to be the same exact experiment\n\nWhen you start to dig into it, there’s all these differences in the way it was done\nIt’s really hard to know which of those differences contributed to the different outcomes\n\n\nIn this particular case, because it was a 30, 40 year experiment, we’re never going to find out\n\nThe study won’t be repeated because of how long it takes \nAnd also the view on primate research has changed\n\n\nMatt’s gut feeling is that the Wisconsin study probably is closer to a typical American situation\n\nConsider the typical American diet\n",

mass?”\n\nWe don’t know the answer\n\n\n\nHow do molecular signatures of aging change with caloric restriction? \n\nRoz Anderson (who’s still at Wisconsin) has been a leader in the study of molecular signatures of caloric restriction in the monkeys and asked, “Does it look similar to the molecular signatures of caloric restriction in rodents?” \n\nA lot of the questions that people have around caloric restriction studies in mice are, “Will it work the same way in people?”\n\n\nA lot of what we see in terms of changes in mTOR signaling and mitochondrial function and other metabolic pathways is in fact shared between mice and monkeys \n\nThat is one important outcome from these studies that we can definitely say is rock solid\n\n\nMatt tends to believe that the dramatic declines in age-related disease seen in the Wisconsin studies are telling us something\n\nBut is this telling us that NOT being obese reduces the risk for a lot of diseases?  \n\nWe already know that from the human literature\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much of the effect is from CR versus DR (dietary restriction)? \n\nThe Wisconsin experiment suggests that if you have an awful diet, reducing the amount of awful food you eat is a good thing\nThe NIA experiment doesn’t tell us the contrapositive\n\nIt doesn’t suggest that if you have a good diet, eating less will help you live longer\n\n\nWe don’t know if the Wisconsin animals lived longer simply because (1) they lost weight or (2) they lost weight AND they were eating less processed food\nAdditionally, the NIA monkeys were eating a superior diet to the Wisconsin monkeys, but they also ate less in total than the Wisconsin monkeys\nSo if you ate more of a good diet, would that be detrimental?\n\nWe don’t know\n\n\nIf they had been body weight matched or caloric consumption matched, that would’ve been an interesting comparison to be able to see if there differences \n\n \nAn evolutionary perspective of the human diet [1:03:45]\n\nPeter recently read Herman Pontzer’s book, Burn \n\nIt discusses the ecology and evolution of humans as a species and how we are different from our closest evolutionary cousins\nWe have an incredible capacity to store excess energy\nHe measures metabolic rates using experiments with doubly labeled water and compares: modern humans, current hunter-gatherers, and primates\nOur energy needs are far greater than anything else, this is needed to support our brain\nHe argues we are better able to store energy because we have a hard time tolerating a low energy environment\nHe discusses the lack of obesity in animals in captivity that are overfed\n\nInstead they put on lean mass\n\n\nHe argues that metabolic sickness comes not with the inflation of subcutaneous fat but when it spills out into the viscera, liver, peripancreatic space, perinephric space, and pericardial space\n\n The problem is fat that escapes the normal depot of subcutaneous fat is inflammatory and metabolically disturbing\n\n\n\n\nPeter mentions this book to say, “It’s just one more confounding variable that makes it difficult to compare us even to an organism as complex as a rhesus monkey”\nMatt agrees this is a criticism of the caloric restriction literature\n\nEspecially the mouse studies‒ there are all sorts of differences between people and mice\nThe metabolic state people have evolved to fill is completely different from mice\n\n\nBut even lab mice as they get older will show metabolic syndrome‒ insulin resistance and other changes you see in people\nMice gain adiposity with age, they do in fact become obese with age\nIn the Wisconsin study, a significant fraction of the control fed monkeys developed diabetes\n\nAbout 25% of the controls were pre-diabetic by the end of the study even though they weren’t overweight\nGetting 28.5% of your calories from sugar is probably going to impair your metabolism\n\n\n\nAn evolutionary perspective of the human diet \n\nMatt relates this to the argument that certain diets are better for humans because it mimics what we evolved to eat\n\nHe doesn’t know if this is true or not\nYou could argue both sides\n\n\nHe doesn’t see any particularly compelling reason to think that was the optimal longevity diet that humans ate 100,000 years ago\n\nPeter finds the evolutionary diet argument illogical\n“By necessity, we had to be opportunistic omnivores.  To even suggest that our hunter-gatherer forefathers were sitting around pontificating about what they were and were not going to eat is just the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard” \nThe argument becomes nonsensical when you realize our evolution necessitated the most flexibility from a nutritional standpoint\n\nWe ate anything and everything\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolutionarily, we probably never existed in an environment where food abundance was go great that we could reach a level of over-nutrition \n\nMatt adds, maybe this metabolic flexibility is one of the reasons why humans seem to be fairly robust towards earring really, really crappy diets\n“Obviously, we have an obesity epidemic and all of that stuff happening, but people seem to be able to tolerate a wide variety of different diets, some of which are pretty darn bad for them for many, many years before you start to really see the significant consequences. And it may be that metabolic flexibility.” \nPeter makes a different point, “People can survive in really remarkable health with diets that look nothing like one another”\n\nCompare a strict vegan diet to a ketogenic diet\nSomebody eating a really well formulated, strict vegan diet, where they’re not getting any animal protein (which clearly our ancestors all had animal protein whenever they could), they’re often a little protein malnourished, but they’re very healthy\nSomebody on a ketogenic diet is eating a much higher fat, higher protein diet, and they can be very healthy\nAnd probably the only thing these diets have in common is a lot of leafy vegetables\n\n\n\n“That to me speaks to the resilience of our genome in terms of its interaction with nutrition”‒ Peter Attia\n\nMatt agrees, this brings them back to where he started, “Which is that there’s no reason to think that the ancestral diet is best”\nHe now thinks our dietary options and the typical diet is evolving rapidly now\n\nThe quality of the food, the stuff that’s in it, the preservatives, is dramatically different than it was 50 years ago, both in caloric content and nutritional content\nThe taste is absolutely different, which contributes to why a lot of people want to eat more\n\n\nWe’re in an environment of high calorie, really good tasting food that’s often cheap\nThe environment that we evolved into obviously is completely different than it is today\nBut our environment is changing at an accelerating pace, and that makes it really complicated to try to get into the minutia of what is optimal\nThis is where Matt struggles with the data that comes from epidemiological studies of people 20 years ago\n\nThe environment, the food quality is just very different for most people today than was even 20 years ago\n\n\n\n“Maybe we should be thinking about what’s good enough first, because I think it’s going to be really hard”‒ Matt Kaeberlein\nThe grandmother test \n\nWhen Peter watches the extremists on both sides argue, he says 2 things\n1 – There are good and bad ways to do the same diet\n\n“I don’t want to hear somebody tell me that everybody on a vegan diet is doing well because I watched a lot of those kids in college and they literally were going to kill themselves eating ramen noodles and crackers and cookies all day. So, you can be vegan and eat pure garbage. You could be keto and eat pure garbage.”\n\n\n2 – If you’re eating those diets well, you’re doing all your shopping on the perimeter of the grocery store\n\n“It doesn’t matter if you’re carnivore, vegan, keto, low carb, paleo, whatever. If you’re doing those diets in the way that they were at least thought to exist, you aren’t going down any aisles of the grocery store.”\n\n\n\nThat’s the grandmother test‒ if your great grandmother didn’t recognize what you’re eating, it doesn’t pass the test \n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s not good, Peter doesn’t want to say a protein bar is not a good thing to eat\n\nYou just have to acknowledge there’s a little more risk there\nEating a carrot is inherently less risky than eating a protein bar with 14 ingredients in it\n\n\n\nWe need just a little humility around what is known, what is not known.  And as we push the envelope of convenience of nutrient density, of economics, price, shareability, portability, the ability to preserve things, we’re going to take some risks. \n \nAntiaging diets: Separating fact from fiction—Matt’s 2021 review in Science [1:12:30]\n\nMatt was asked by one of the editors at Science to write a review on mTOR\nHe’s been thinking a lot about caloric restriction and particularly other nutritional strategies that people have been studying in the field‒ ketogenic diet, protein restriction, time-restricted feeding, intermittent fasting\n\nAnd what do we actually know about those diets and their effects on aging? \n\n\nThis isn’t something that his lab researches directly \n\nMatt has previously done work on caloric restriction in invertebrates and C. elegans \nThey have never really have done a lot of dietary interventions in mice\n\n\nBefore he dove into the literature, he had this impression that all of these diets were similar in some ways and had maybe comparable effects on lifespan\n\nThis was his impression from reviews, but he doesn’t think much of what gets into the literature as review articles are actually reviews\nReviews are more one person’s opinion piece on their specific thing that they study, which is unfortunate\n\n\n\n“Reviews on caloric restriction and other dietary interventions, they’re very one-sided”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \n\nMatt proposed to the editor that he should do a critical review of this space and think about “What do we know, what do we don’t know, are they equivalent? And to the extent possible, can we gain any insights into whether or not these nutritional strategies, whether there’s evidence that they have an impact on the aging process in people?” \n\nThis was a very ambitious thing to tackle\nHe’s not sure he really appreciated exactly how challenging that was going to be, because it’s a huge area of literature\n\n\n\nAnd turns out, that there are many more questions than there are answers when you really dive into it \n\nMatt had a fantastic set of co-authors, all really great early career scientists who really helped with this and did a lot of the legwork\n\n1 – Alessandro Bitto, was a postdoc with him\n2 – Mitchell Lee, was a former graduate student of his\n3 – As was Crystal Hill, who’s at the Pennington Biomedical Research Institute \n\nShe works on FGF21 and protein restriction\n\n\nThese were the 3 co-authors on this paper with him, just really fantastic early career scientists\n\n\n\nDiets addressed in the review \n\nQuestion #1‒ what are the different popular dietary interventions that people have claimed have an effect on aging?\n\nThey came up with 6 or 7\n\n\nTrue ‒ is pretty straightforward‒ limit overall caloric intake from 20-65%\n\nThis is mostly research in mice\nThen they looked for parallels in humans\nThey didn’t go deep into caloric restriction because that literature is huge and other people have done a pretty good job of reviewing it\nThey touched on some important points\n\n\nVariants of caloric restriction include intermittent fasting and time-restricted feeding \n\nIn most studies in mice, the experimental group ate less calories than the control, so this is a flavor of caloric restriction not isocaloric\n\nHe thinks of it as intermittent caloric restriction\n\n\n\n\nTo differentiate between time-restricted feeding and intermittent fasting‒ \n\nThe easiest differentiator is time-restricted feeding is limiting the number of hours in a 24-hour period that the animal or person eats\n\nThat window can be 12-6 hours, sometimes more extreme\n\n\nA 24-hour or more fast defines intermittent fasting \n\n\nTime-restricted eating gets more complicated because there’s evidence that’s not only about how big the window is, but where in the day of the window is\n\nIn their review of the literature they found a clear connection between how much we eat and when we eat that ties into circadian rhythms and that circadian biology\n\n\n\nSubsequent studies reemphasize the importance of when we eat and what we eat \n\nMatt thinks both are probably going to be significant in terms of the consequences of the long-term health effects\n\n\n Fasting-mimicking diets are diets that have been engineered to some extent to induce the same metabolic changes as caloric restriction, usually very low sugar, relatively low protein, high fat, but also very low calorie\n\nThat goes in the bucket of a flavor of caloric restriction\n\n\nOther diets are ketogenic diets \n\nAn ad lib ketogenic diet might end up restricting energy, but not deliberately\nMatt doesn’t know if that answers the question of whether the benefit comes from caloric restriction\n\n\nAnd protein restriction, some are isocaloric protein restriction\n\nYou have to look closely at each paper to figure out if it’s isocaloric or not\n",

They’re basically doing a two-week fast between their meals.”\nMatt explains that you see a pretty dramatic reduction in organ size, even in 24 hours in a fasted mouse, and these mice are only fed 3x a week\nThey’re going through this reduction in organ size and then this really rapid hypertrophy\n\n\nYou can see that decrease in organ size and then rapid increase even on some of the fasting mimicking diet work that Valter Longo has done\n\nAn experiment to compare the impact of calories not time of day for feeding \n\nPeter asks if anyone has done an experiment to mimic the way humans eat\nTake 2 groups of mice\nThe controls are fed 100% of the nutrient, but they’re fed every 2 hours over the course of the day\nThe CR group is fed 70% of what the controls get, and they’re fed at the same time intervals,  constantly throughout the day\nThis compares the impact of calories and there is only fasting when they sleep\nAt least 1 of the 2 studies Matt was referring to did this\n\nFasting drives the metabolic, molecular, and geroprotective effects of a calorie restricted diet in mice\nCircadian alignment of early onset caloric restriction promotes longevity in male C57BL/6J mice\nThat’s how they were able to identify that ⅔ of the benefit came from the reduction in calories and ⅓ came from the additional fast\n\n\nOne point Matt made in the review is, the vast majority of the literature around intermittent fasting and time-restricted feeding and fasting mimicking diets, they’re calorically restricted\n\nSo, there’s a fasting period and a caloric restriction component\nAnd none of the prior studies really teased that out in a way that allowed us to have an understanding of how much of the benefit is calories and how much IS fasting, and maybe how much is WHEN you’re fasted\n\nThat’s still is an open question\n\n\n\n\n\nEating early in the day versus late in the day \n\nMatt is not an expert in this area and doesn’t have an opinion about which is better\nThis is where he thinks mice are not going to be a good model for humans\n\nThese studies need to be done in people\n\n\nPeter recalls, “Some have suggested that an early feeding window versus a late feeding window produces better pairing of our insulin sensitivity to our nutrient arrival”\nMatt thinks this makes sense\n\nMost people would agree that if you’re eating something that causes your blood sugar to spike, doing that right before you go to bed is probably suboptimal\nSo if you’re going to do a time-restricted feeding, it might be better to eat earlier and not right before bedtime\n\n\nThese kinds of questions are really complicated in humans because you could ask about different benefits‒ \n\nOvernight blood glucose levels\nSleep quality\nOther biomarkers\n\n\nThese benefits might be different in different people and different from each other\nMatt notes, “In my mind at least it’s not even really clear how we evaluate what is better and what is suboptimal. It may depend on what your endpoint is, what you’re actually interested in optimizing.” \nPeter has seen in people who wear a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) that early feeding produces an overall lower average glucose\n\nEven if you do the same meal early in the day versus late in the day\nThere’s something about how long it takes glucose levels to come down at night versus in the morning\n\nIt could be you’re more insulin sensitive in the morning and therefore it comes down quicker\nIt could be something to do with pairing sleep with the nutrition that is tweaking this and there’s a feedback loop where the excess glucose creates a little more cortisol\nBut at the same time, you theoretically should have the lowest cortisol at night anyway\n\n\nGenerally it doesn’t produce a great quality of sleep\nThis gets into the minutiae that Peter wants to hear more about\n\n\n\nMatt’s big picture takeaway \n\nThese nutritional intervention studies in mice are very powerful for dissecting the biological mechanisms that underlie the effects that they have\nSome of these diets clearly have effects on aging\n\nMatt is very hesitant to suggest that people should adopt any of these diets based on the rodent literature where it’s at today (for a whole variety of reasons) \n\nStudies in mice are super useful for understanding the biology but he’s not sure they are going to work the same way in humans\n\n \nNutritional interventions that consistently impact lifespan in mice, and concerns around efficacy in humans [1:27:00]\nStudies of a ketogenic diet \n\nThere have really only been 2 studies that have looked at the lifespan and healthspan of mice on a ketogenic diet \n\nThey were slightly different\n\n\nIn mice you have to go really, really low sugar to get the mouse to go into ketosis (1% or less carbohydrate diet)\n\nThis is different from people\n\n\nOne study of lifelong ketogenic diet saw no effect on lifespan \nAnother study used an intermittent ketogenic diet, something like every other day or maybe once every 3 days or something\n\nOn the other days they ate a regular diet\nIn some ways this was an intermittent caloric restriction\n They found a 15% increase in lifespan \n\n\nThe fasting-mimics diet papers are using intermittent-ketogenic diets\n\nMaybe that’s one thing to agree on is that intermittent ketogenic diets in mice can increase lifespan and seem to have benefits for healthspan \n\nThe effects aren’t huge\n\nCaloric restriction is a nutritional interventions that consistently give big effects on lifespan \n\nIn the most extreme study, they used 65% caloric restriction and this gave about a 65% increase in lifespan‒  a big, big effect size\n\nThis is the Weindruch and Walford paper\nMatt doesn’t remember the details but thinks their studies were early onset caloric restriction\nThis study was interesting because they did a graded response of 25-65% caloric restriction, and this produced a graded response in lifespan that was roughly linear\nAnimal care protocols wouldn’t allow you to do this study today\n\n\n\nHow angry are the mice on ⅓ of their normal caloric intake? \n\nOne of the remarkable things about caloric restriction in mice is that they are more active throughout life than ad lib fed mice are\n\nMaybe it’s an evolutionarily selected foraging response\nYou give them a running wheel and they’ll just run and run and run\n\n\n\nBehavioral changes is one of Matt’s real concerns about caloric restriction in people \n\nWe should be realistic and recognize you’re never going to get a significant fraction of the population to calorically restrict\nIt’s hard enough to get people to calorically restrict down to a healthy weight\nTo get them to go 30% beyond that, it’s just not going to happen\nMatt knows people who have done every possible anti-aging intervention you could imagine\nHe knows a lot of people who’ve dabbled in various forms of caloric restriction\n\n“True caloric restriction has real psychological consequences”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \n\nThere’s social isolation that you get when you’re calorically restricting\nBut then there’s the biological changes in the brain and you’re hungry all the time\nWe often don’t appreciate those aspects of some of these nutritional interventions\nBut in the mice, it’s hard to know what their psychological consequences are\n\n \nDiffering impact of calorie restriction when started later in life [1:31:00]\nWhat do we know about caloric restriction later in life in the mice versus earlier? \n\nThe NIA experiment we talked about earlier in monkeys, the early fast didn’t improve longevity\n\nThe late fast appears to have, although that was sort of a subgroup analysis\nIt’s hard to draw a causation there \n\n\nFor a long time, the dogma was that caloric restriction didn’t work if you started it past, I don’t know, 15 months of age, which is maybe the mouse equivalent of a 40, 50 year old person\nMost of the early caloric restriction studies were done starting sometime pre-development\nEarly rat studies were pre-development and 6 or 9 months of age \nIf you do a graded onset of caloric restriction, you can get lifespan benefits from caloric restriction at 20, 22 months of age \n\nIn other words, don’t go right from ad lib to 40% restriction the next day\nWhether it’s as good as starting early, Matt thinks the consensus is still that the answer is NO\nYou’re never going to get the same magnitude of benefit from caloric restriction, starting late as you do starting early\n\n\n\nMatt doesn’t think we know for sure whether it’s possible, if you did it just right, that you could get most or all of the benefits from starting late in life \n\nPeter notes, “On this topic of CR in mice the dogma has generally been… that CR in mice only works early in life.  How applicable is that to humans?”\nThere are some data that try to get at this question‒ a 2019 study by Hahn with 800 female mice\nFor the 1st 3 months they ate an ad libitum diet\nAt 3 months they were randomized to 2 groups, (1) 40% caloric restriction and (2) ad lib \nThis study continued until 24 months, then each of those groups were further split\nEveryone was the same for the 1st 3 months but by the end there were a total of 4 groups: (also summarized in panel (a) in the figure below)\n\n1 – Caloric restricted (labeled in the figure below as DR, dietary restricted)\n2 – Ad lib (AL)\n3 – Caloric restricted from 3 months to 21 months, then ad lib (DRAL)\n4 – Ad lib to 21 months then caloric restricted (ALDR)\n\n\n\nFindings‒ \n\nFigure 2.  Mouse lifespan for different diets.  Image credit: Nature Metabolism 2019\n\nThe ad lib group lived the shortest (the blue line in the figure above)\n\nThe maximum lifespan was 1200 days \nThe median lifespan was about 900 days\nThis is a reasonable lifespan for control animals\n\n\nThe all CR mice had a maximum lifespan of just below 1,400 (the red line in the figure above)\n\nTheir median lifespan was around 1,150\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s interesting are the middle groups… \nBefore we get to that, Matt points out that beginning CR at 3 months is pretty early onset of CR\n\nThis goes back to discussion of rat studies earlier, where really large benefits of CR come from being restricted during development itself\n\n\nThe big question is, “What happens if you start caloric restriction late in life?”\nThis study did a sort of flip/ crossover design where they started CR late in life\n\nThis produced a significant but not huge effect\nExtension of lifespan is much less in the group that began CR at 24 months (the green line in the figure above) than the group that was CR since 3 months (the red line in the figure above)\n\nThis fits with the literature\nEarlier studies, by Steve Spindler started CR at maybe 15 months [correction‒ 19 months]\nThey saw a significant, but not as large benefit from starting CR late in life\n\n\n\n\nThis current study asks a really interesting question, “What happens if you’re CR’d for an earlier period in life and then back on AL? Do you lose the benefit?”\n",

about when you go on and when you come off? \n\n\n\n\n\n“We don’t really know what the mechanisms are”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \n\nThe difference in the maximum lifespan is trivial, the real differences between the groups is in the median lifespan\n\nMatt’s takeaway‒ we can’t draw too many conclusions from humans from this, but what is the underlying mechanism?\nQuestions‒  \n\nIs it about the total time you’ve been on CR?\nIs it an interaction with how old you are (the developmental process) when you do CR?\nWhat happens when you go on CR at the end of life, which is mostly the degenerative process?\n\n \nLifespan extension with rapamycin in older mice [1:37:15]\nComparison to what we know about mTOR and rapamycin \n\nWith rapamycin, the data are pretty clear that you can start rapamycin well into middle age and maybe even into very old age, and get most of the benefit\nIf you compare the curve here where they started the mice on CR at 22 or 24 months, the effect is pretty small compared to CR\nWith rapamycin, you get almost exactly the same benefit, starting at 20, 22, 24 months as you do starting early in life\n\nSo that might tell us that there’s a difference\nThere clearly is a difference- a different mechanism or a different dose effect\n\n\nPeter talked about this with Rich Miller on the podcast‒ the fortuitous accident, about getting the correct formulation of rapamycin for absorption/ bioavailability\n\nMatt tells the story of rapamycin \n\nIn the early 2000s the NIA started a program called The Interventions Testing Program\n\nThe idea here was really smart\nWe could create a tool where the scientific community could nominate interventions for lifespan testing in mice, and it was set up so that it would be done in triplicate, three sites\n\nThere still are three sites for the ITP\n\n\n\n\nSo anybody in the community can nominate any intervention\nThere’s a selection committee that selects them every year\nIf an intervention is selected, then the Intervention Testing Program sites start the cohorts of mice on that intervention in whatever year it was selected for\nSometime back in the early 2000s, Dave Sharp nominated rapamycin\n\nHe was ahead of his time\nThis was before/ around the time the 1st invertebrate studies on mTOR and rapamycin were published\nHe was thinking about it from a cancer perspective\n\n\nThis program typically tests 5-6 interventions or drugs each year\n\nSo they have a huge number of animals at each of these 3 sites that are destined for this type of testing (ITP)\n\n\nRandy Strong was one of the PIs on the ITP, he has a really strong biochemistry background\n\nHe recognized quickly that rapamycin wasn’t stable in food\nRapamycin gets broken down in the pH of the gut\n\nSo basically if they just put the powder in the food, there’s no bioavailability, it doesn’t get taken up by the mice\n\n\n\n\nThey realized this problem when they were supposed to start the experiment \nRandy or somebody said they could figure out a way to stabilize rapamycin and put it in food so they could do the lifespan experiment in mice\n\nWhat they didn’t recognize was that it was going to take 18 months or so to figure this out\n\n\nBefore this, everyone in the field (including Matt) thought you had to start an intervention early in life, or you weren’t going to get much of a benefit\nFortunately, they went ahead with the experiment, starting at 20 months of age\n\nThey found was that they got this robust lifespan extension from starting with rapamycin treatment at 20 months of age \n\nJust to give some context, that’s about the mouse equivalent of a 60 or 65 year old person\nMatt loves this experiment because first of all, nobody thought it was going to work except maybe Rich Miller\nIt was really the first time anybody had convincingly shown that you could start an intervention in middle age, in a mouse, and get a robust lifespan extension\nWhen Matt reviewed the paper and saw that result, he realized this changes everything\n\nThis paper came out in 2009, so it’s been 13 years since then\n\n\n\n“We actually have a chance for translational geroscience, because you might be able to intervene late in the aging process and have significant impact”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \n\nThe whole paradigm in the field has changed\nToday, most people studying interventions test for efficacy late in life\n\nBecause that’s what we need to do in people\n\n\nSo this result with rapamycin was super important for the field for that reason\n\nAnd it all came about by an accident\nNobody would’ve designed that study that way beforehand\n\n\n\nThe bioavailability of rapamycin \n\nThis recently came across Matt’s radar, and he’s heard several results that convince him it’s true\nHe mentioned the reason why they had to make this eRapa (encapsulated) is because rapamycin isn’t stable at the gastric pH of mice\n\nThe same thing seems to be true in people\nSo there are people who are getting their rapamycin from the Rapamune, which is the brand name ( Sirolimus is the generic), it comes in these triangle shaped pills\nThere are also people who are getting it from compounding pharmacies\n\n\n\nMatt has heard of several cases now where the bioavailability is much lower in the compounded rapamycin in a capsule than in the actual Rapamune \n\nPeople should be aware of this\nHe doesn’t think most physicians are aware or it nor are compounding pharmacies\nPeter has never had it compounded, he only prescribes Sirolimus or Rapamune\n\nIt’s not a cheap drug so he can understand why there’s a desire to compound \nThe cost is around $5, $6 a mg\n\n\n\n \nRelationship between protein intake and aging, and mouse studies showing protein restriction can extend lifespan [1:43:30]\n\nOne of the other things that came out of Matt’s review article of the animal stuff was protein restriction\nOf all the topics in nutrition, this is the one Peter is most interested in\n\n“Don’t tell anybody, but I care an awful lot about protein”‒ Peter Attia\n\nPeter is deliberate about trying to eat a gram of protein per pound of body weight, spread out into 4 buckets\nThere’s reasonable evidence to suggest that if you consume too much protein in one sitting, you’re going to oxidize some of that protein\n\nTypically more than 0.25 grams per pound\n\n\nIt’s not that more is harmful, you’re just not getting the amino acids you need for muscle protein synthesis (his objective)\nThe RDA says he’s crazy, recommended daily allowance of protein is 0.8 grams per kg\n\nThis is less than half of what he consumes\n\n\nHe’s doing this on the basis of other data that suggests that this is the amount of protein consumption you need for optimal muscle protein synthesis\n\nWhere does this disconnect? \n\nWe can talk about the biology of aging and the rodent studies\nThe RDA question is a different question\n\nIt’s Matt’s understanding that this was developed for 95% of the population when sedentary\nThis is not necessarily the optimal amount and probably depends on lifestyle and lean body mass\n\n\nThere’s a lot of confusion among the general public about what the RDA means\n\nIt’s not necessarily a bad thing to be above the RDA in some areas, maybe a lot of areas\nPeter jokingly thinks of the RDA for protein as what you need to not waste away, wither up, and die\n\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between protein intake and aging? \n\nThis is a really important question\nIt’s gotten a lot of attention in the field but there’s a lack of clarity about what we actually know and what we should be recommending to people\n\nMouse studies show protein restriction can extend lifespan \n\nThere are different flavors of protein restriction and it’s not clear that the mechanisms are the same across these different flavors of protein restriction\n\n1 – Restrict all protein down to some low %\n2 – Restrict tryptophan\n3 – Restrict methionine\n4 – Restrict branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine)\n\n\n\nThe common mechanism that does seem to potentially underlie all of these forms of protein restriction is inhibition of mTOR \n\nProtein is an activator of mTOR and we know a fair amount about the biochemistry of that, that particularly branch chain amino acids can directly activate mTOR through sestrins\nIt seems intuitive that protein restriction would be beneficial by turning down mTOR\n\nThis is the simplest possible mechanism for why protein restriction (especially branched-chain amino acid restriction) would be having an impact on lifespan and healthspan in mice\n\n\nIt seems counterintuitive that consuming increased protein would be beneficial, because you might be hyper activating mTOR \n\nFGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21) \n\nFGF21 is the other important player in protein restriction (particularly total protein restriction) \nFGF21 is secreted in response to a low protein diet, and then has effects on liver metabolism \nIt also inhibits mTOR and reduces IGF-1\nSo that seems to be required for the lifespan extension that is seen from protein restriction in mice, potentially partially upstream of mTOR in liver metabolism.\nOverexpression of FGF21 has been reported to be sufficient to extend lifespan in mice \n\nQuestions about protein restriction studies \n\n1 – Is protein restriction always beneficial in mice? \n2 – Can we separate it from caloric restriction? \nYou have to look closely at the studies and determine, did the mice on protein restriction eat less, eat the same amount and eat more?\n\nYou can find examples of all of those\nThis has to do with the different compositions of the diet\n\n\nWhen you restrict for certain amino acids (such as methionine), mice will eat more but they don’t seem to gain weight and they live a little longer\n\nSo there could be a different mechanism there that we don’t really understand\n\n\n\nMatt’s takeaway from protein restriction studies in mice \n\nBranch chain amino acid and methionine restriction studies are pretty clear that those animals are consuming more calories than the ad libitum mice (certainly if you match to weight), and they’re living longer\nWe don’t know the mechanism by which methionine exerts this effect\nLots of mechanisms have been proposed:\n\nmTOR likely plays a role\nMethionine is used to synthesize S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which is a methyl donor for DNA methylation so maybe it’s important for epigenetic modifications \nMethionine is the first amino acid in every protein, so there could be effects on protein synthesis\nThere’s evidence linking methionine restriction to sulfur amino acid biology, which has been implicated in aging\n\n\nLiterature on inhibition of protein synthesis in invertebrates show this is enough to extend lifespan\nmTOR is a primary regulator of protein synthesis\nSo when you inhibit mTOR, you can also inhibit protein synthesis\nThat’s part of the challenge here, is this network is so interconnected that when you tweak one part of it, you have effects throughout the network, and it’s really hard to know which of those effects are causal\n\n \nImpact of protein intake on mTOR, and why inhibition of mTOR doesn’t cause muscle loss [1:50:45]\nHow long is mTOR activated in response to the increase in amino acids? \n\nMatt is not sure\nIt will depend on what you eat in combination with the protein, when you eat, and how active you are \nPeter talked to David Sabatini about this, through the lens of BCAA (branched-chain amino acid) drinks\n\nA few years ago it was recommended to pound branch chain amino acids during a workout to get as much anabolic signal as possible (maybe things have changed now)\nBobby Saxton was the guy in his lab who did the Science paper that looked at the leucine sensor for the mTOR pathway\n\n\n\nThe answer was, it didn’t’ stay on long at all \n\nFree amino acids are very short in their ability to turn on mTOR\nIt’s so short-acting that the idea of using BCAA analogs to treat sarcopenia was going to require drugs that could stay on much longer\n\nThis short-acting signal fits with the concept of homeostasis \n\nMatt adds, “This gets back to the whole homeostasis concept”\nCells and tissues have evolved to maintain metabolites, and amino acid are metabolites\nAmino acids are involved in many different metabolic reactions within certain levels\nThere are all sorts of mechanisms to ensure that if a metabolite it’s outside of that range, we soak it up and we do something else with it\nMatt thinks it makes sense that you’re probably not going to have a persistent increase in branched-chain amino acids, far outside the normal range\nHOWEVER, slightly elevated branched-chain amino acids chronically can have big effects on the sort of downstream processes\n",

    "content": "\nThere are some inborn diseases of childhood where you have elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids\nThere are consequences to even having somewhat modest increases in mTOR, say, hyperactivation of mTOR signaling chronically\nSo again, the context really matters\n\n\n\nIt’s Matt’s intuition that it’s probably hard to get very large, persistent increases in mTOR simply from taking a branch chain of amino acid supplement \n\nPeter adds, “The anabolic data suggests it’s not necessary”\n\nThe muscle protein synthesis window is open long enough that simply delivering a great source of whey protein in the hours after a workout seems sufficient to not restrict muscle potential growth\n\n\nMatt points out‒ “It’s important to appreciate… not only how high mTOR gets turned or or how low it gets turned down, but also where that happens”\n\nThis is true with rapamycin as well\n\n\n\nWhy doesn’t inhibition of mTOR cause muscle loss? [1:50:00]\n\nPeople for a long time thought that rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) would cause muscle loss, but we don’t see that in mice or in people or in dogs\n\nMatt guesses that has maybe more to do with WHERE mTOR is being affected, than HOW MUCH we’re inhibiting mTOR\n\n\n\nDo we know where the selectivity of rapamycin is? \n\nIs it more selective in hepatocytes? \nIs it more selective in adipose tissue?\nMatt doesn’t know of any good studies that have carefully looked at this\nIt gets even more complicated because, even in a mouse, where you can essentially control almost everything (what the mice are eating and when they last ate has), it [BCAA consumption] has as big as or maybe a bigger effect on mTOR signaling than rapamycin \nThere have been a couple studies that looked at this and they got different answers, and Matt’s not sure who to believe because he doesn’t think either was wrong\nIt’s complicated and that’s why Matt will often gravitate back towards the question, “What are the functional consequences we can actually measure?” \n\nFor example, you think treating a mouse with rapamycin is going to cause sarcopenia; let’s do the experiment and find out\n\nThe answer is no, it doesn’t\nSo that tells us, it’s at least not as simple as we thought it was going to be\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLow-protein vs. high-protein diets and their effects on muscle mass, mortality, and more [1:55:30]\nOn the flip side, is more protein versus less protein activating mTOR in a way that is counterproductive? \n\nMatt thinks it can, in certain cases\nHe doesn’t know if anybody has carefully done that study in mice\nThere was an interesting study by Steve Simpson and colleagues, here they did this nutritional geometry work, where they looked at a range of diets with different composition of 3 macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) and asked, “What does it look like in terms of metabolism, energy expenditure, lifespan?”\nDiets where the mice lived the longest were towards the low end in protein\n\nBut there were some things that called into question exactly what was going on there, because it wasn’t the case that the diets that were energetically lowest gave the longest lifespan, as you might expect from caloric restriction\n\n\n\nAn ad lib diet with 40% protein resulted in the best absolute lifespan (they were not calorie restricted at all) \nHow do we reconcile this body of literature? \nMatt’s interpretation‒ there are many ways to get there\n\nWe really don’t understand the inner relationships of these macronutrients in the diet with enough sophistication to get beyond sort of broad general prediction\nThis is an area where his intuition from the data he’s seen (and his observations of people), is that in humans, this relationship between protein and health during aging is probably very different than it is in mice\n\nHe thinks mice are able to tolerate a very low protein diet without some of the consequences that we see in people \n\nHe doesn’t know that’s true, but that’s his intuition\nPeter agrees, the number of problems that occur in humans when they are undermuscled are insane\n\nMetabolic consequences\nOur muscles are the single most important sink we have for glucose\n“Our ability to tolerate glucose and maintain glucose homeostasis in the presence of larger, more metabolically, healthy muscles is the difference between having diabetes and not having diabetes”\nWe don’t study any animal (including primates) where sarcopenia and osteoporosis are problematic\n\nYet, how many people over the age of 75 are suffering from one of both of these phenomena? \nPeter wouldn’t be shocked if at least 80% of people over 75 experience this\n\n\nActivity level falls off a cliff once people hit 75 and muscle mass dramatically plummets\n\nIt’s difficult to say which one is feeding which\n\n\n\n\n\n“There’s no question that something is happening to our species at about the age of 75 that is a structural problem”‒ Peter Attia\n\nPeter’s take on aging, “I don’t care if I live to a hundred and don’t have cancer, if I’m an invalid for the last 25 years and I can’t play with my grandkids and throw a ball.”\nMatt adds, the question for people is, “How important is dietary protein in that maintenance of muscle or loss of muscle (in people who are going the wrong direction)?”\nPeter thinks the data shows protein is quite important\n\nThere are lots of studies that have compared the RDA to double the RDA standard\nProtein makes a very big difference following the training that is necessary to stimulate muscle protein synthesis\n\n\nMatt agrees, training and protein intake have to be coupled\nPeter recalls data showing that protein intake alone can make some difference in muscle protein synthesis\n\nBut it’s not nearly the difference you get when you pair it with hypertrophy training\n\n\n\nWhy is there a vocal camp in the aging field that argues for low protein as the best nutritional strategy for aging and healthspan in people?  \n\nMatt’s takeaway‒ “You can find the answer you want for almost any question in this area that intersects with nutrition and aging. There will be a study that will fit your belief.”\nHe tries to take a global view and understand what the totality of the data saying\nBut there are epidemiological studies and one in the field most people will point to when they go to humans and they talk about low protein, the study that Valter Longo was I think the senior author on and Morgan Levine was the first author on where they looked at protein consumption and all-cause mortality as a function of age in people\nThere were some studies in yeast as well\n\nThe take home message was that low protein is beneficial up to about 65 years of age, and then once you get above 65 years of age, it kind of flips and people who ate a higher protein diet have lower all-cause mortality \n\nTo be clear we’re talking specifically about all-cause mortality\nWhen Peter looks at deaths per 100,000 people (to adjust for population size of each age group) at age 40, 50, 60, 70, 80‒ above the age of 65, deaths goes up very non-linearly\n\nYou could argue that a high protein strategy, even throughout life, is better because the absolute reduction in mortality would be lower due to the benefit you would have later in life\nMatt agrees, the impact of a change in mortality late in life is going to swamp the same impact on mortality early in life\n\n\nMatt thinks the question here is, “What are the relative effects?” \nIn their model, the relative risk crossed somewhere in the 60s\n\nIn other words, your total mortality benefit was lower eating a high protein diet\nThat actually surprised Matt because for exactly the reason you said, the relative impact of the high protein diet early in life would have to be an order of magnitude greater than the relative impact of it late in life\nMatt doesn’t remember the exact details, but in the paper you can see the curves cross later than he would have expected given they picked age 66 (see the figure below)\n\nMatt would have thought the age would be in the 50s\n\n\nHe tried to do his own modeling but he couldn’t get the data\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.  Association between protein consumption and mortality.  Image Credit: Cell Metabolism 2014\nQuestions from this study: \n\nWhen should you switch your diet?\nAt what age does the risk equal out?\nMatt found that once you get past 50, the benefit of a high protein diet on mortality seems to outweigh any detriment\n Peter thinks if you restrict protein late in life, it would have no benefit on healthspan \n\nExcluding people with renal insufficiency \n\n\nMatt intuitively agrees, but the mouse rapamycin experiments makes him hesitate\n\nEverybody who knew anything about muscle said if you gave a mouse rapamycin throughout life, ti was going to get sarcopenia, and that just didn’t happen\n\n\nPeter is saying, there is clinical data suggesting a huge difference in muscle mass for people over the age of 65 who are protein deficient versus protein significant\nMatt asks, “Do we have controlled studies where people were eating low protein and doing resistance training late in life? They’re a nuance here that could complicate things. But I think in general, you’re probably right.”\n\n \nThe impact of IGF-1 signaling and growth hormone on lifespan [2:06:30] \nIGF-1\n\nThe other complication is the convention of using IGF-1 as a biomarker for protein intake\n\nIt’s certainly associated with protein intake\n What is it a proxy for? \n\n\nIGF-1 is insulin-like growth factor one; it’s a hormone\nYou can think of it as a growth promoting hormone, part of this central pathway that promotes growth in many, many different tissues\nIf you have high growth hormone levels, you’ll have high IGF-1 levels and high mTOR\n\nIGF-1 is a part of the mTOR pathway as well, upstream of mTOR (see the figure below)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.  Activation of mTOR by leucine, IGF-1, and Glucose.  Image Credit: Obesity 2012\n\nThink about this from the opposite perspective, instead of high IGF-1 signaling, the next figure shows the effects of low IGF-1 signaling \n\nLow growth factor levels (such as IGF-1) is a result of caloric restriction and some diets \n\n\n\nThe effects of this on downstream processes is summarized at the bottom of the figure; these are processes that benefit from caloric restriction \n\nFigure 5. Connections between pathways of low growth factor signaling and mTOR and the effects on downstream processes. Image credit: Science 2021\n\nThe reason why people have been really interested in IGF-1 in the field of aging biology comes from studies in very simple laboratory model systems\n\nThe insulin-like receptor in C. elegans called daf-2 is the most famous one and 1st gene clearly shown from a mechanistic perspective to contribute to aging\nThis work was done by Cynthia Kenyon and Tom Johnson before her\nCynthia published a classic paper showing that if you make a mutation in daf-2, it could double the lifespan of worms and they seem to be healthier about twice as long\nWhat that mutation does is it turns down signaling through this pathway\nIt’s a little bit more complicated in worms, because it’s called the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, so it’s not identical\n\nThere’s one path in worms that kind of takes the place of both IGF-1 signaling and insulin signaling, but you can kind of think of them as equivalent\n\n\nAnd then there are a whole bunch of studies in mice for mostly mutations in the growth hormone, upstream signaling, upstream of IGF-1, that lead to increased lifespan\n\n\n\nPeter asks, “So this means GH (growth hormone) does not activate the production of more IGF-1?”\n\nThat’s right, you have high GH and low IGF-1 signaling\nOften it’s the receptor that’s mutated\nThese animals tend to be very long lived\n\nThey rival caloric restriction in terms of the magnitude of life span extension\n\n\nThere are several different mutations in this pathway, it’s complicated and there have been controversies about mutations that directly affect IGF-1 itself and the effects on lifespan\n\nBut there’s no question that mutations that reduce growth hormone signaling in mice extend lifespan \n\nIt’s important to understand that those studies are all cases where the animals are deficient in growth hormone through development‒ these animals are very, very small\nOne study used a monoclonal antibody to the IGF-1 receptor, and they treated mice late in life and got an lifespan increase of 14-15%\nPeter remembers this study; that antibody did not penetrate the CNS\n\nHe remembers Matt saying this would provide all the benefits of IGF in the brain with the potential harm of IGF in the periphery\n\n\nThis is another complication‒ the effects of IGF in the brain on for healthspan and cognitive function might be fundamentally different than high IGF-1 in the periphery\nThis study is the best evidence in mice that you can get some benefit from reducing IGF-1 signaling in middle age\n\nShould you take growth hormone to combat aging?\n\nLots of patients ask Peter to be put on growth hormone, and he just won’t do it",

[2:13:30] \nMatt’s takeaway: IGF-1 is probably not that informative in people, particularly once you get past 50 years old \n\nPeter adds, “It’s important for people to understand that just like testosterone is mostly bound to sex hormone binding globulin there’s only a small amount of testosterone that’s free. It’s the same with IGF-1. It has these IGFBPs (or binding proteins) that bind most of it. And therefore total IGF is not really completely informative as to what’s happening, even in terms of the quantity that’s there for signaling because it’s not the unbound portion of it.”\nSome people look at things like the IGF to IGFBP ratio, the bigger that number is in theory, the more IGF signaling you would have\n\nWhen you look at epidemiologic curves which show IGF levels rising on the X-axis and mortality increasing on the Y-axis, Peter has never seen one of those curves that just goes up\n\nSometimes they’re U-shaped, sometimes they’re down sloped, sometimes they’re flat and it depends on the indication\n\n\n The story seems much more complicated than IGF is bad \n\n\n\nConfounding factors in the literature \n\nGoing back to the Levine paper, it’s important to recognize that the population you’re looking at might make a big difference\n\nIf 30% of the population is obese and a high % have metabolic disease or diabetes, then having high IGF-1 in that context might be very different than for somebody who is insulin sensitive, exercising, and eating a high protein diet\nThese kinds of things don’t typically come out in these epidemiological studies\n\n\nMatt also looked in the literature to see what other studies have shown that same relationship, and they’re all over the place\n\nIs a high protein diet detrimental? \n\nYou can find studies epidemiological that really don’t show any downside to eating a high protein diet in people\nIt’s hard for Matt to draw too much confidence that high protein is significantly detrimental when you’re younger than 50\nFurther, he feels pretty confident that a higher (higher than the RDA level) of dietary protein intake when you’re above 50 is beneficial, particularly if you’re exercising\n\nHe would be concerned if the person is overweight, diabetic, and sedentary‒ high calorie + high protein could be problematic\n\n\nPeter agrees, a lot of the epidemiology is tainted by high protein in the context of high calorie\n\nStudies in people who have very low growth hormone signaling \n\nIt’s interesting to think about people who have mutations in the growth hormone pathway\n\nThey go through their entire lives with low growth hormone signaling\n\n\nValter Longo published studies on little people of Ecuador \nThere have also been studies of the Laron Dwarf Syndrome\nThe most famous one published in Science, where they looked at lifespan and age related health outcomes in the people with low growth hormone signaling versus controls in their same environment \n\nInterestingly, there is no difference in lifespan\nBut the reduction in cancer risk is profound\n1 person in the cohort developed a cancer, was treated, and lived the rest of her life\nThe rate of diabetes was a little lower, but in that part of Ecuador they had a very low diabetes rate (maybe 5%)\n\n\n\nSo why didn’t they live longer? \n\nThey had a higher rate of alcoholism, liver failure, and accidents\nThis gets back to the social and psychological consequences in humans that are different from mice\nGrowth hormone deficient mice are probably not subject to the same social pressures as people with very low growth hormone signaling are\n\nThis pressure may contribute to other things later on, like alcoholism\n\n\n\nMatt’s takeaway‒ I think that you can impact at least a subset of age related biology by being constitutively low in growth hormone through your entire life. What would happen if you did that in bursts, post developmentally, just after puberty say from your twenties and thirties?  \n\nThere are no naturally occurring examples of intermittent low growth hormone signaling to look at and evaluate\nPeter asks, “Is there enough data to look at people with acromegaly during different periods of their life to see if they have a higher incidence of cancer?” \nThat population would be small, but maybe it’s possible\n\n \nParting thoughts on the contribution of nutrition to healthspan and lifespan [2:19:45]\nMatt’s take on the protein content of diet and growth hormone signaling as it relates to healthspan and cancer risk \n\nEpidemiological studies are a mixture of normal people typically, and so the lifestyles most people are living are what gets weighted in those types of analyses\n\nLifestyles may be very different if you are normal weight and eating high protein, maybe high calorie (because you’re extremely active) than if you’re overweight, sedentary and eating a hot calorie diet\nThat’s underappreciated and probably really important\n\n\nMatt speculates about the cancer risk‒ he doesn’t think that high growth hormone signaling and high IGF-1 signaling, everything else being equal in a person leads to a higher risk of developing cancer \nEven if it is the case that higher signaling through that pathway = higher risk of cancer, we can make an argument that it doesn’t seem to be the case (at least in certain populations of people) that high growth hormone signaling or treating with growth hormone dramatically increases the cancer incidence \nPeter points out, “We should also differentiate between high causes it versus low removes it, just because we have a genetic example of where not having it creates a deficiency of cancer.  So going from sort of a 100 to 30 decreases cancer, doesn’t mean going from 100 to 130 increases cancer.”\n\nThe point is, we don’t know… it could\n\n\nMatt goes deeper into the cancer risk‒ “removed it” isn’t quite right\n\nThere are many steps that have to happen in cancer to go from  pre-initiation of cancer, to cancer, to metastasis, to somebody dying from it\nAnd there are different defense mechanisms that act at each of those steps\nHis guess is growth hormone and IGF-1 are primarily acting at the very early steps where we know that if you promote cell division, that is a sort of a permissive early environment that allows mutations to happen and cancers to get a foothold\nIn most cases, it seems that those early cancers are detected and wiped out by our immune system\nOne of the reasons why I think a lot of cancers become more prevalent as we get older is because the function of the immune system to detect and clear those cancers declines\nThere is other stuff going on that contributes to the process,  such as accumulation of senescent cells \n\n\nIn theory, a 60 year old person who is exercising, eating an appropriate diet might be biologically a 40 year old person (or have an immune system functioning like a 40 year old)\n\nThey might have a little bit higher IGF-1 and a little higher risk of early cancer but they have a much lower total risk of developing cancer because their immune system has a better chance of catching it and getting rid of it\n\n\n\n“And those are things we don’t even think about”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \n\nPeter adds, “We’ve created more questions than answers” \nMatt replies, “It’s a complicated question”\nAnd we didn’t dive into the genetic interaction with caloric restriction\n\nEven in mice where we can control everything else, if you look across genotypes, you get different results from the same diet and the effect of caloric restriction on lifespan\n\n\nSo maybe we can’t answer the big detailed questions \n\nMatt’s takeaway‒ \n\n1 – We’ve learned a ton from nutritional studies in laboratory animals about the biological mechanisms\nWe’ve learned a lot about which proteins and pathways are important and that has led us to things like rapamycin, which might be a more effective intervention in humans\n2 – You don’t have to worry about every little detail\n\nMost people can get a big chunk of the way there by eating a relatively healthy diet\nDon’t worry so much about how much protein, how much carbs, how much fat\n\n\n\n“Eat good foods, don’t overeat, and be active, exercise”‒ Matt Kaeberlein \n\nMatt worries that society does this and scientist sometimes do it too as they get into the weeks\nQuestions like, “What should my fasting window be?” \nMatt thinks you can get most of the benefits without worrying about a lot of that\n\n",
