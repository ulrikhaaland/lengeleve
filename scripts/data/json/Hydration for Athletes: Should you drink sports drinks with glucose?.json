It really isn’t a good idea.” —Peter Attia\n\nIf you feel that you need a more isotonic solution—because remember water is the most hypotonic solution there is\nSO if you feel like you need to really increase volume, not just water, then you’re better off just drinking, in my opinion, an electrolyte solution that’s free of glucose.\n\nOne other point to make:\n\nwhen you’re exercising, there is a benefit to having glucose in there, in addition to the electrolytes, because they facilitate the absorption of each other faster\nthat’s where there is truth to some of the marketing claims you see where adding glucose at the right amount to an electrolyte drink will speed up the absorption\nToday, we have very good data, and the data is that a glucose containing solution of about 5% to 6% is the sweet spot\n\nAnything that has a higher concentration than that is basically going to be a little bit too rich\nAnd in fact, it’s going to start to become hypertonic\n\n\nIsotonic is going to be about that 5% to 6% range\n\nThe mistake that a lot of people make…\n\nMany people err on the side of too much glucose\nYou see people out there for a 5k fun run, and they’ve got two gels that they’re squirting in their mouth and they’re drinking a Gatorade — that’s just way too much\nFirst of all, Gatorade and Powerade alone is about an 8% solution so they are already slightly higher than isotonic\nThen when you go and add two goos to it, you’ve basically created the most hypertonic solution imaginable — you’ve taken it from 8% to probably 20%. \nThe reality is, you don’t even need those calories to run a 5k\nYou should just be drinking your volume with electrolytes\n",
