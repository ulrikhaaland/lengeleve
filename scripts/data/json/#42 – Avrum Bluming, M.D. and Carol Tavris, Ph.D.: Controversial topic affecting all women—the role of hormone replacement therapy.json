    "content": "In this episode, Avrum Bluming, hematologist, medical oncologist, and emeritus clinical professor at USC, and Carol Tavris, social psychologist and author of Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me), discuss their collaboration on their recent book, Estrogen Matters. Their book takes on the very polarizing and confusing topic of hormone replacement therapy for women suffering with symptoms of menopause. In many ways, the story and history of HRT is in striking parallel to the bad science that led up to the dietary guidelines being set forth in 1980. Carol and Avrum make a compelling case that most women benefit greatly from being on postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, and can do so without increasing their risk of breast cancer. We also cover the history of HRT, the impact of the Women’s Health Initiative, and take a deep dive into each of the clinical conditions for which HRT should be considered, such as cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease, and osteoporosis, to name a few.\nDo you have questions about this controversial topic? Dr. Bluming has graciously offered his email to take questions directly from fans of the podcast: avrumzbluming@gmail.com\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#42 - Avrum Bluming, M.D., and Carol Tavris, Ph.D.: Controversial topic affecting all women—the role of hormone replacement therapy through menopause and beyond—the compelling case for long-term HRT and dispelling the myth that it causes breast cancer\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#42 - Avrum Bluming, M.D., and Carol Tavris, Ph.D.: Controversial topic affecting all women—the role of hormone replacement therapy through menopause and beyond—the compelling case for long-term HRT and dispelling the myth that it causes breast cancer\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#42 - Avrum Bluming, M.D., and Carol Tavris, Ph.D.: Controversial topic affecting all women—the role of hormone replacement therapy through menopause and beyond—the compelling case for long-term HRT and dispelling the myth that it causes breast cancer\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nThe background of Carol and Avrum, and the impetus for writing Estrogen Matters [8:45];\nThe sad early history of hormone replacement therapy, treatments for prostate and breast cancer, and the difference between the treatment of women vs. men [14:00];\nWhat hormones do, and why they drop off rapidly in women compared to gradually in men [20:15];\nMistreatment of women leading to great skepticism [23:45];\nBreast cancer vs heart disease: Comparing the incidence and mortality in women [27:00];\nCase studies of women suffering symptoms of menopause [30:00];\nWhat are Carol and Avrum’s true motivations in this endeavor?

Having treated over 20,000 patients, Alan shares his invaluable insights into what works and what doesn’t in terms of the non-surgical treatment options. We also go into great detail about the more invasive approaches like PRP, and of course, hair transplantation, a procedure which Alan has refined over the years into a proprietary method that seems to produce unbelievable results. Additionally, Alan provides tips for maintaining scalp health, which is vital for hair growth, as well as the importance of choosing a hair specialist who has the tools, expertise, and patience to develop a compassionate and encompassing approach to hair restoration.    We discuss:  Alan’s unique path, and how he became interested in hair transplantation [7:15]; The prevalence of hair loss, types of hair loss, and the different patterns in men vs. women [15:45]; The role of genetics in hair loss, and when does it start [19:00]; Female hair loss: the role of hormones, pregnancy related hair loss, and what it means to have thinning and shedding [22:30]; Primary drivers of male hair loss, finasteride as a treatment, and the potential side effects [26:15]; Common treatments - Proscar, Propecia, Rogaine, and more - how they all came about and what you need to know [29:45]; Primary drivers of female hair loss, potential treatments, and the different types of hair follicles [33:15]; What are some of the unproven/snake oil methods of hair treatments being pushed to the public?

Cover of Estrogen Matters. Image credit: amazon.com\nDr. Carol Tavris, social psychologist\nWhat’s a social psychologist writing about estrogen for?\n\nMy lifelong interest has been in bringing good scientific research in psychology and medicine to public attention\nAs a social psychologist, I have always been interested in the barriers to critical thinking and the reasons that people do not accept information when it is in their best interest to do so\nThese interests culminated in her book, Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)\n\nThis book was about “why it is that people resist new information that is better to know, that it’s beneficial, that improves our knowledge”\nThis book is one of Peter’s all time favorites, “one of the three books I have recommended and/or gifted the most”\n\n\n\nDr. Avrum Bluming, medical oncologist\nWhy in particular has this issue become something that’s resonated with you?\n\nI’ve spent over 50 years as a medical oncologist and my reason for going into the field was to help people live as long and as well as possible and helping to decide how best they should be treated\nBreast cancer constitutes about 60% of my practice and I’ve watched the progress in breast cancer very happily noting how many people we now cure (about 90% of the cases are now curable)\n\nHowever…\n\nWhile I was making a lot of people better in terms of the cancer, I was making them worse in terms of the symptoms associated with the treatments they got. When you treat something for that long, you want to understand what it is so that you can treat it most effectively.\nIt is important that I challenge every assumption on which my practice was based and I’ve done that continuously. \n\n“The major assumption dealing with breast cancer is that estrogen causes breast cancer, and it doesn’t. Almost everything we’ve done in the treatment of breast cancer is based on that assumption so that women have been denied estrogen for at least the last 30 years. . . and the result is that many women have been hurt by being denied that medicine.”\n\nThe sad early history of hormone replacement therapy, treatments for prostate and breast cancer, and the difference between the treatment of women vs. men [14:00]",

HRT and Breast Cancer: A timeline of relevant events and studies. Image credit: (Bluming and Tavris, 2009)\nMen vs. Women: Comparing the early history of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\nUsing the example of how we treated prostate cancer in men with breast cancer in women… \n\nThe number of women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer is approximately comparable in the United States. \nAnd the number of women who die of breast cancer is comparable to the number of men who die of prostate cancer each year.\nTherefore, the medical establishment made the false leap that testosterone is responsible for prostate cancer and estrogen is therefore responsible for breast cancer\nProstate cancer was treated initially by castration of the testicle ⇒ it doesn’t cure it, but it helps in some cases\nSo, women were castrated by removal of the ovaries to eliminate estrogen to treat breast cancer ⇒ it helps in some cases, but not many\nFor prostate cancer, if the castration didn’t work, we stopped and gave palliative care\nWith breast cancer, if castration didn’t help, we kept removing things…\nAdrenal glands of women (by the way, adrenal glands make a small percentages of circulating testosterone, but we never removed the adrenal glands of men)\nOnce you remove the adrenal gland, you have to replace the hormones that were necessary for survival, which they did\nIf the adrenal gland removal didn’t work, we then would take out the anterior pituitary gland at the base of the brain because that gland produces a hormone that stimulates either the ovary or the testicle to make the responsible hormone.\nWe used to do hypophysectomies and while I was in practice, we did that, says Avrum\nBut again, the anterior pituitary makes many hormones that are necessary for survival so they had to replace many of those hormones\nThey even started to prophylactically remove the ovaries of those who previously had breast cancer to try to keep it from coming back \nAnd even after all of this, “we didn’t really help too many women with that”\n\n“Let me reiterate, we did nothing like that for men and we hurt a lot of women by doing that. We did it with good intentions, but we hurt them.” \nEarly history of HRT using estrogen\nA book in 1968 called Feminine Forever by Robert A. Wilson\n\nThe book essentially said women should take estrogen forever and it’ll be an eternal fountain of youth\nBut that’s not true, that book was oversold, and the doctor who wrote that book was paid for by the drug company who made estrogen\nThis book did a lot of damage to the trust of community in terms of using estrogen as a treatment \n\nBut estrogen did do some very good things…\n⇒ First, estrogen can relieve the symptoms of menopause\n\nAnd it’s not just hot flashes and night sweats, symptoms include:\n\nPalpitations\ncognitive decline\njoint pains\nsleep disturbances\ndepression\n\n\n\n“It usually lasts about seven and a half years, not two years, and in some women it goes on for decades and women are taught to suck it up and deal with that.”\nEstrogen and heart disease\n\nIn 1991, an article was published: Uncertainty about Postmenopausal Estrogen — Time for Action, Not Debate\nIt suggested that estrogen is also capable of reducing significant heart disease by up to 50%\n“That was 1991 and we now know that estrogen has been shown repeatedly to help diminish the risk for significant heart conditions.”\n\nWhat hormones do, and why they drop off rapidly in women compared to gradually in men [20:15]\nPeter hardly ever prints a physical copy of a paper, however, these two are a couple of the exceptions:\n\nFirst publication of the WHI and the 2003 republication\nA figure showing the hormone cycle for a woman during her reproductive years… “I started doing this about three years ago and I was surprised how many women didn’t know what estrogen was doing in their body.”\n\n\nFigure 3. Hormone cycle. Image credit: primaleye.uk\nWhy do some women experience horrible PMS symptoms?\n\nIt has to do with the reduction of progesterone\nAnd in some women, the fall of progesterone during the end of the luteal phase is so rapid (for reasons we don’t understand) it produces a drastic change\n\nFemale hormones rapidly decline (not gradual)\n\nWomen have hormones such as \n\nluteinizing hormone,\nfollicle stimulating hormone\nAnd they are coming out of the pituitary and telling the ovaries to make yet more hormones\nThen suddenly, during menopause, their production seem to drop off a cliff\n\n\nWhy? ⇒ Evolution may have wanted women to be able to reproduce up to a point and then it turns off the hormones that are responsible for allowing reproduction (i.e. this cycle of rising estrogen, progesterone falling)\n\n“This is a crucial thing to say, Peter. This is really important. This was something I didn’t realize until we began working on this book. I assumed that in menopause, estrogen declines. I think that’s the way women see it. It just declines the way testosterone declines in a slow, moderate way. No, estrogen plummets to 1% of what it was before menopause. I think most women have no idea that it’s that great a drop in estrogen levels and no wonder that many of the symptoms that women have, which by the way include depression which they’ve attributed to a ‘midlife crisis’. No, it could be an estrogen depletion crisis as well. I think it’s really important for women to understand that this is not just as a little fall off, it’s really a major drop.”\nMistreatment of women leading to great skepticism [23:45]\n“What interests me is the way women have been given false information for so many years about so many aspects of their reproductive cycle and experience that it’s no wonder that many women have a great skepticism about what medicine has to offer them in reproductive issues.”\n\nThere was so little hesitation in cutting women up\nRemoving this part and removing that part\nThings that would never have been tried with men\n\nFeminine Forever by Robert Wilson \n\nIt oversold the benefits of estrogen\nRobert Wilson was paid by makers of estrogen treatments to write the book\nIt created even further skepticism\nIt also created a defiance in the feminist community of “the hell with all of you on this estrogen, I don’t need it, it doesn’t make me feminine forever and who dares to think that I need to be feminine forever in that traditional way!”\n\n“What I want our conversation to bring here is an understanding of why women have been whipped back and forth on whether estrogen is good for them or bad for them.” says Carol\nOther examples of how women were mistreated\n\nThe radical mastectomy ⇒ Sid Mukherjee has written about this in The Emperor of All Maladies\nPituitary resections (Transsphenoidal resections)\nOophorectomies\nResecting adrenal glands\nThe routine use of hysterectomy\n\n“The routine use of hysterectomy on the assumption that a woman, once she’s had her children, doesn’t need to have her uterus. And by the way, since we’re removing your uterus, let’s remove your ovaries as well because what the hell, they’re just there, let’s take them out as if they have no function. That casual attitude of let’s just get in there and get rid of.”\nBreast cancer vs heart disease: Comparing the incidence and mortality in women [27:00]\n\nEstrogen can significantly decrease the risk of heart disease\nHowever, many women believe that “old women die of heart disease, young women die of breast cancer”\nSo the women often say they’d rather not take estrogen if estrogen causes breast cancer\n\nFirst of all, estrogen does not cause breast cancer\nBut more than that, in every decade of a woman’s life, the incidence of death from heart disease is greater than the incidence of death from breast cancer. \n\n\n\nDeaths from heart disease vs. deaths from breast cancer in women\n“Heart disease kills more women than the next 16 causes of death, including all forms of cancer, AIDS and accidents.”\n\nFigure 4. Forward-looking projection of mortality from breast cancer and from cardiovascular disease by decade in women: Age 20-50. Image credit: knowyourchances.cancer.gov\n\nFigure 5. Forward-looking projection of mortality from breast cancer and from cardiovascular disease by decade in women: Age 30-75. Image credit: knowyourchances.cancer.gov\nMore stats . . . \n⇒ Risk of dying (US):\n\n1-in-4 (25%) women die of heart disease\nThe lifetime risk of dying from breast cancer is 1-in-38 (2.6%)\nIn other words, women are 10 times more likely to die from heart disease than breast cancer\n\n⇒ Risk of developing (US):\n\nWomen have a 1-in-8 (12%) risk of getting breast cancer\nThe lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease is more than 1 in 2\n\nAbout 56% of women\n\n\nIn other words, women are ~5 times more likely to get heart disease than breast cancer.\n\n⇒ Almost two-thirds (64%) of women who die suddenly of coronary heart disease have no previous symptoms\nWomen present with heart disease quite differently than men\n\nMen tend to have crushing chest pain that radiates down their left arm, starting at the shoulder\nWomen, however, can often present with an upset stomach\n\n“And because we generally don’t think of women as suffering from heart disease, the diagnosis is initially missed quite often.”\nCase studies of women suffering symptoms of menopause [30:00]\nPeter was caring for a female patient\n\n47 years old\nHer labs showed what looks like completely normal levels\n\nFSH  at 10\nEstradiol at 90\n\n\nShe was having symptoms\nPeter suspected she was in a perimenopausal state and that she would enter menopause in the next three or four years\nRechecked her book 3 months later and was shocked\n\nFSH up to 68\nEstradiol was so low that it was unmeasurable\n\n\nWhen consulting a gynecologist friend, he told Peter, “You just happened to see her fall off the cliff. This happens all the time. It’s just we usually aren’t looking at laboratory tests that frequently”\n\nBlog post by Katie Taylor: Finding the positive side of menopause\n\nShe was having all sorts of symptoms\nShe was treated for her depression with antidepressants, which didn’t help\nTurns out she was in perimenopause\n\nUnexpected symptoms\n“Many of the symptoms that women begin to develop in their 40s, they don’t associate with menopause. Muscle pain sends them to rheumatologists and depression sends them to therapists and fighting with their spouses sends them to family therapy. And they don’t think that their changes of menopause might be involved.”\nWhat are Carol and Avrum’s true motivations in this endeavor? [32:45]\nCarol: \n“Neither of us has a vested interest in this. Neither of us has taken any money from drug companies. I have been a vociferous critic of big pharma and a lot of its manipulations of research and its inflated claims. No, I don’t have a personal interest in defending HRT. In fact, as a feminist psychologist for many years, I was really critical of the kind of ‘take it for granted assumption that once a woman hits menopause, then you gotta fill her tank with hormones to get her back to being a real woman’. I was very critical of that, which was easy for me to do when I was 35.”\nAvrum: \nNo vested interest, either.\nHowever, he does have a personal story to share… \n\nHis wife got breast cancer at age 45\nShe was treated with chemotherapy and at the same time she went into menopause\nShe was very symptomatic (although, she didn’t complain for two years)\n\nNight sweats\ndifficulty sleeping\njoint pains\nPalpitations\n\n\n“But women are supposed to suck it up and take it. And she did.”\nStruggling to read⇒ “Then she started to find that reading, which is her passion, was now being challenged, because when she’d read a book, she couldn’t remember what she had read two or three pages before.”\nShe eventually was put on HRT ⇒ “It took about two weeks and she was back. She would never go off them.”\n\nPeter tells a story about how his interest was piqued: \n\nHe met with a woman 5 years ago who had survived ER/PR-positive breast cancer which means her cancer showed sensitivity to estrogen, progesterone\nVery young, in her 40s\nShe underwent a hysterectomy, oophorectomy and mastectomies\n“She basically became lost.”\nUnable to get off the couch\nShe described a feeling of fog",

    "content": "\nShe was told, “Once the chemo is done, you will feel better.”\nThree years after the chemo, she felt worse\nIt finally occurred to her and to her husband that maybe this had something to do with the fact that at the age of 42, overnight she lost every sex hormone in her body\nShe couldn’t find any doctor on the planet who would prescribe hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to her, because as a breast cancer survivor who’s ER/PR-positive, how could you do such a thing? \nThough she did eventually find someone who was willing to give her a trial.\nShe felt immediately better ⇒ Within weeks she felt like she got her life back\nBy the time Peter met her, she was on a “very clever regimen”:\n\nTopical estriol (not estradiol)\nShe didn’t need progesterone (because she had hysterectomy)\nPhysiologic replacement of testosterone (up to about half a nanogram per deciliter level)\n\n\n\n“Her case interested me so much, because I started thinking, ‘Wait a minute. Isn’t she increasing her risk of breast cancer?’ I won’t get into the details of where that took me, which rabbit hole, but it obviously in some way led to a converging discussion that we’re having today.”\nThe changing perceptions of HRT, the impact of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), and the problems with the WHI [37:45]\nPicking up in the 1950-1960s. . .\n\nRobert Wilson’s book, Feminine Forever, has encouraged many women to get on estrogen\nPremarin was the primary source of estrogen\n\nPremarin, acronym for pregnant mare urine, is still the most used form of estrogen today\nThe company who makes Premarin is who paid Robert Wilson to write Feminine Forever\n\n\n\nIn the early 1970s. . .\n\nThere was a sharp rise in uterine cancer\nTurns out, estrogen, given alone, can increase uterine cancer by 5-fold, says Avrum\nSo estrogen replacement fell off dramatically\n\nIn the late 1970s. . . \n\nIt was learned that progesterone together with estrogen, nullified the risk of uterine cancer, so HRT started to increase again\nIt continued that way until about 2002 when it was estimated that about 16 million women in the United States were taking HRT\n\nEither estrogen alone if they didn’t have a uterus, or the combination, if they did have a uterus\nThat constituted about 22% of the appropriate age population in the US\n\n\n\nBy 2004. . .\n\nHRT use was down from 22% to 10% of age appropriate population \n\nBy 2010. . .\n\nHRT use fell to 5%\nThis was largely due to the first publication of the Women’s Health Initiative\n\nNurses’ Health Study\n\nPublished in 1995\n~120,000 nurses were followed for 30 years\nFound that women who took HRT for 5, 10, or 15 years had no increased risk of breast cancer\n\nWomen’s Health Initiative (WHI)\n\nStudy was initiated in 1996, and first published in 2002\nThe theoretical rationale for the study was NOT to see whether it increased breast cancer… what they wanted to see is did it really have a beneficial effect on the heart and the brain and the bones\n\n⇒ The WHI had two separate studies\n\n1) Nutritional study\n2) Hormone replacement study\n\nProblems with the hormone replacement arm of the WHI:\n⇒ The study participants:\n\nAvg age was 63 (which is 10 years after menopause)\n70% were very overweight or obese\n>50% were smokers\nMany had hypertension\n“This was not an ideal, healthy sample, by any means.”\n\n“For economic reasons, it made sense to choose an older population. But this was never a normal population, and as soon as the study came out in 2002, it was immediately extrapolated to all women everywhere.” \n⇒ Exclusion of symptomatic women\n\n“When I first read it, I thought, ‘That can’t be right.’” says Peter\nwomen who were especially symptomatic were excluded\nThe reasoning being is that there was a concern that if you took in women who had serious vasomotor symptoms and they were randomized to the placebo, your drop-out rate would be too high\nThat would be alright, if you acknowledge that up front, says Avrum, but the WHI reported “findings” that HRT had absolutely no benefit on quality of life\n\nThe reason they found that is because women who were significantly symptomatic were excluded\n\n\nNew York Times headlined it saying, “Hormones have no benefit, even on quality of life.”\nBy the way, the 13% of the women who were symptomatic had a significant improvement, but they were lost among the entire population\n\n“13% of the women who were symptomatic had a significant improvement, but they were lost among the entire population.”\nIs this one big conspiracy? The uncanny resemblance of the story of HRT and how the dietary guidelines were created [46:00]\n\nFigure 6. Major headlines in response to the WHI press release. Image credit: blogs.plos.org\nA scientific “no-no”\n\nPrior to the release of the actual data… The WHI put out a huge press release: Clinical Alert: NHLBI Stops Trial of Estrogen Plus Progestin Due to Increased Breast Cancer Risk, Lack of Overall Benefit\n\nSaid another way… “We found this increased risk of hormones on breast cancer, so we have to stop our study immediately and have press conference and announce this terrifying finding” \n\n\nThis is a big no-no in scientific communication and publication\nAdditionally, the alleged increased risk of breast cancer, was not statistically significant\n\n“In my business, you don’t get to go into publication and say, ‘Gee, we didn’t get any significant results here. We found something that looks problematic or interesting and maybe we need to do more research.’ But not significant? That’s what really first gave us pause. Why are they heralding this strange finding, for what purpose? Why are we wanting to scare an audience in advance of actually offering the real data? That’s what got our skeptical neurons flaring.”\nSo, was this a conspiracy?\n“You hear this and it stinks of conspiracy theory. Except that I’m the most anti-conspiracy theory guy out there. I typically attribute to incompetence, rather than malice.” says Peter\nCarol’s reaction:\n“I think they were behaving just like scientists who went into this research with a strong belief that HRT is harmful to women and in particular, increases the risk of breast cancer.”\n\nFor example, Jacques Rossouw, who was the cardiologist who led the Women’s Health Initiative, had published an article in 1996 saying “it’s time to bring the HRT bandwagon to a halt”\n“When you go into a research project with a belief that you really are sure of, you see in the data what you expect to see in the data.”\n\nAvrum’s reaction:\n“The 2002 WHI paper says that this increased risk of breast cancer almost reached nominal statistical significance. I don’t know of any other article anywhere that states that. Statistically significant doesn’t mean it’s true, but it means the finding has a less than 1 in 20 chance of being a coincidence, so it’s worthy of investigation. But ‘almost reached nominal statistical significance’? That sounds like you’re straining to reach a conclusion that you didn’t reach.”\nIt is unprecedented that a press release would be put out prior to the study with the data:\n“I don’t know of any other situation where JAMA or the New England Journal came out with a press release before the published article was available to doctors to read.” says Avrum\nRobert Langer revealed the story behind this… \n\nThere were 40 principal investigators distributed across the country\nThey were summoned to a meeting to discuss the paper that was going to appear in JAMA\nThey were told for the first time what this press release was going to consist of… and their reaction was “You can’t do this.”\nThey were told, “Too late. The article’s been published in JAMA and it’s at the warehouse ready to be sent out.”\n\nSo, how could this be a conspiracy?\n\nBy who exactly?\nBecause most of the investigators themselves never saw that first article\n\nThe real reason for this?\n\nThe pressure felt by the investigators to come up with a significant finding since so much money was spent and the stakes were so high\n\n⇒ Some shocking quotes:\n\nRowan Chlebowski, one of the 3 writers of the WHI publication, said the following (paraphrase): “You know, this is the most expensive study ever done.

So, if we think we have found something and the results don’t quite add up, the statistical police have to leave the room.”\nGarnet Anderson, the statistician for the WHI, said the following (paraphrase): “Well, when it’s an issue as important to women as breast cancer, we intentionally set the bar low.”\n\n⇒ One more explanation offered by Carol: Negativity bias\n\nThe WHI was trying to gain attention in the media… and people are more drawn to negative news than to positive news and certainly negative news is what sells\nJacques Rossouw told a reporter from the New York Times that they wanted to do it this way to “break into the noisy news cycle” and get attention for the study\n\nWhy people (falsely) think estrogen causes a 25% increase in breast cancer, and a lesson in absolute vs. relative risk [57:15]\nA very common question Peter gets from women: Doesn’t HRT increase the risk of breast cancer by 25%?\n⇒ Where did this number come from?\n2013 JAMA paper: Menopausal Hormone Therapy and Health Outcomes During the Intervention and Extended Poststopping Phases of the Women’s Health Initiative Randomized Trials (Manson et al., 2013)\n2015 JAMA paper: Breast Cancer After Use of Estrogen Plus Progestin and Estrogen Alone, Analyses of Data From 2 Women’s Health Initiative Randomized Clinical Trials (Chlebowski, et al., 2015)\nRandomization of the study:\n\nYou had two cohorts of women\n\nCohort #1: You had women who had already undergone a hysterectomy and they were randomized to estrogen (CEE, conjugated equine estrogen) or placebo\nCohort #2: And women whose uterus was still in place were randomized to CEE plus MPA (medroxyprogesterone acetate) versus a placebo\n\n\nRandomization was one-to-one throughout\n\nResults:\n\nThe women in cohort 1, those that were randomized to just estrogen, had no increased risk of breast cancer\n\nThey actually had a 21% decreased risk, but it was not statistically significant\n\n\nThe women in cohort 2, those that received both estrogen and progesterone, there was a reported 26% increase in risk of breast cancer compared to placebo\n\nHowever, it also wasn’t statistically significant… “So by scientific standards, we think that could have been caused by chance alone.”\nP-value was below .05\n\n\n\n⇒ Even though the 26% increase was not significant, there was an explanation for this increase:\nThis article provides the explanation: Menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer: what is the evidence from randomized trials?\n\nThere are 2 ways you “find” there to be an increase in risk\n\n1) You can have a real increase in risk in the non-placebo group\n2) Or, the women who were randomized to placebo, had a lower than expected risk of breast cancer\n\n\nAnd in the case of this study, you find that it was in fact reason #2, the placebo had a lower than expected risk\n\n⇒ So, what was the explanation for this?\n\nIn cohort 2, many of the placebo women had previously (before the study) been on HRT\nAnd having previously been on HRT, they therefore had a lower risk of breast cancer (the opposite of what the paper was suggesting would happen to someone on HRT)\n\n\nFigure 7.

If the numbers jumped from one person to two persons out of a hundred or out of a thousand, that’s not a very big thing. Let’s say it’s doubling the risk, but it’s trivial. If the numbers double from 500 to 1000 in a group of 10,000, then we might have a finding we should be paying attention to.”\nThe lack of reported absolute risk:\nCarol laments, “Avrum and I were at pains in our book to see when we would read studies that reported an increase risk or reduced risk of something to see what the absolute number were. In many cases, we couldn’t even find what the absolute numbers were.”\nThe truth about progesterone and cancer risk, and the best types of estrogen and progesterone to be taking [1:09:00]\nWhat about progesterone (MPA)? Does is play a role in the increase in breast cancer?\n⇒ Peter prefaces the question with the fact that when looking at WHI data, the women you got both progesterone and estrogen had an increased risk in breast cancer compared to those that just got estrogen\nAvrum:\n“First, let me go back to saying that the increased risks seen with the combination was not statistically significant, did not hold up, and was due largely a problem with the control group. If you accept that, anything that we say at this point is irrelevant. . .but I’ll take your question.”\n“What has resulted from that is people are saying, ‘Well, the problem really isn’t estrogen. We’ll give estrogen a pass. The problem is progesterone.’”\nIn fact, this particular synthetic progesterone (MPA, medroxyprogesterone acetate) is being blamed\n“Well, I’m not sure there’s a problem because the numbers don’t really bear that out. If there is a problem, there are now forms of progesterone, which are not synthetic, that are now being advised and used; and thus far, have not been associated even with any finding of an increased risk of breast cancer.”\nProgesterone as a treatment for breast cancer\n1 In a randomized trial comparing tamoxifen to progesterone in the 1970s, progesterone did a little better than tamoxifen, but because in the dosage used, it was associated with increase fluid retention, and women became nauseated, it lost out to tamoxifen, but it was used to treat breast cancer.\n2 There was a study that came out of India that found that giving an injection of progesterone around the time of surgery to remove primary breast cancer, significantly improved the prognosis, and decreased the risk of recurrence.\nAre “bioidentical” hormones better? \n⇒ Estrogen:\n\n“The word bioidentical is a buzzword.” says Avrum\nBioidentical really refers to estradiol, which is the leading circulating estrogen in a woman’s body\nBioidentical is also used for what is prepared by pharmacists based on prescriptions written by local practitioners where quality control is lacking. \n“There is no clear dose equivalency. Every responsible investigator I know wants to make the point that buying something because it’s got the word bioidentical, which sounds comforting, is a mistake.”\nPremarin (the most common estrogen medication) is an acronym for pregnant mare urine\n\nIt is the longest studied form of estrogen. \nWe, now, have 60 years of data with Premarin. \nMost of the studies that show the benefit for estrogen are studies that were done on Premarin\nPremarin contains at least 10 different forms of estrogen, including some that are the most beneficial forms of estrogen for brain health, which is not present in “bioidentical forms” such as estradiol or estriol. \n“My preference is Premarin because we have the most data supporting it.” says Avrum\n\n\n\n⇒ Progesterone:\n\n“As far as progesterone is concerned, micronized bioidentical progesterone appears to be the safest form of progesterone administration.”\n\nThe blanket assumption is that estrogen causes breast cancer\n\nHowever, to the contrary, as women get older and have lower estrogen levels, the rates of breast cancer increase.\nWhat do you think explains the mechanism by which estrogen withdrawal and/or removal (same for progesterone) is increasing this risk of cancer? \n\n“The best answer I can give is we think we understand the environment that is friendly to a cancer, which is the environment in which the cancer develops. We try to change that environment to make it less conducive to the continued growth of the cancer. That means in a low estrogen environment, you might use estrogen because that is now unfriendly to the cancer. In a high estrogen environment, you might remove estrogen. Same with testosterone. Exactly how that works, I would use a lot of fancy words, and they would try to cover my ignorance.”\nThe Women’s Health Initiative: the reported findings, walking back their bold claims, and their hesitance to admit they were wrong [1:17:45]\nFirst publication of results (2002): Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: Principal results From the Women’s Health Initiative randomized controlled trial\nReported findings:\n\nThe combination of estrogen and progesterone increases the risk of breast cancer ⇒ “not true”\nIncreases the risk of heart attacks\nIncreases the risk of cognitive decline\nDecreases the risk of colon cancer\nHelps protect the bones\n\n2003 paper in JAMA\n\nThe article claimed “borderline” statistical significance for the increased risk of breast cancer.\n\n2006 paper\n\nIn 2006, a follow-up article said that that reported increased risk in that population had disappeared with continued follow up\n“That article never made the headlines, and most people aren’t even aware of it.”\n\nWalking back their claims:\n\nJoAnn Manson is trying to course correct ⇒ Peter says he heard her on NPR making the point that the recommendations went too far and that “there really are a subset of women, especially those entering menopause, who have symptoms, who deserve to be treated, and we made a mistake.”\n\n“The smallest dose for the least amount of time.” ⇒ this is now the “mantra” from the WHI investigators\n\nBut, “there’s absolutely no empirical evidence to support that advice” say Carol\n“But I think it does represent a compromise in terms of the Women’s Health Initiative’s realization that HRT really was beneficial for quality of life issues for women in menopause.”\n\n⇒ 2017 paper from JoAnn Manson that showed their original conclusions “went too far”\n“What they were not prepared to do was to consider HRT’s benefits over the long haul for women in later years and reducing the risk of osteoporosis, dementia, and heart disease. That they are not willing even yet to suggest that HRT has any prolonged benefits overtime.”\nStudies showing benefits of HRT\n\nThis study by Nananda Col showed that if every woman in the United States do hormone replacement therapy (HRT) it would increase the median survival of women by 3.3 years in this country \n\n“There’s no other intervention I can think of that has such a great consequence for longevity.”\n\n\nThis report suggests tens of thousands of women died prematurely as a result of being taken off hormone therapy\n\nBrain benefits of HRT, Alzheimer’s disease in women, and estrogen as a preventative treatment for AD [1:22:45]\nWomen are two times more likely to die of Alzheimer’s disease than men\nWhy? … Peter’s hypothesis:\n\nThe reason is not that women live longer than men (they live ~2 years longer than men)… that data doesn’t support this being the reason\nPeter’s hypothesis is that it has to do with the fact that women have an abrupt loss of hormones whereas men have a gradual loss of hormones\n\nWhat does the data say about Alzheimer’s disease and taking estrogen?\n\nFor every woman diagnosed over 60 with breast cancer, two women are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s\nThe cure rate for early diagnosed breast cancer is now approximately 90%\nThe cure rate for Alzheimer’s disease is zero\nWe have treatments for breast cancer\nAnd there is no treatment for Alzheimer’s\nThe one potential preventive medication is estrogen which can reduce the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease by between 20 and 50% depending upon the study you look at \nHere’s one study\n\n“The findings converge from all of those directions of research to show the benefits of estrogen on the brain” \nDoes it matter if HRT is “natural”?\nBarbara Sherwin, a psychologist at McGill University answer it this way, “I get so crossed when people say taking HRT is not natural. What’s not natural is for a woman to live to be 85 or 90 years old. And if estrogen is something that can help women to live with healthy mental functioning in those later years, then I am all for it.”\nPeter agrees:\n“If we’ve decided to live a society where we value living beyond our reproductive years, then why aren’t we entertaining things that are ‘unnatural’? It really is an asinine argument to me.”\nSee chapter 5 of Estrogen Matters for more on this topic with references\nThe impact of HRT on heart disease, the ideal time to start HRT, and the risks associated with HRT [1:26:45]\nThe report from the 2002 WHI suggested HRT increased risk of heart disease\nProblems with the WHI study:\n1 The study population was not cardiovascularly healthy\n\nMedian age was 63\n70% were overweight\n34% were obese\n40% were smokers\nMany had high blood pressure\n\n2 Estrogen is capable of causing platelet clumping\n\nIf you already have blood vessels that are narrowed by preexisting heart disease, a platelet clumps can further narrow the blood vessel and caused a cardiac event\nAs a result of that, it is recommended that women with preexisting cardiovascular disease not start on hormone therapy\n\nWhen is the ideal time to start HRT?\n\nIdeally around menopause\nStarting HRT within the first 10 years of cessation of periods\n“There is no increased risk if a woman begins HRT at the time of menopause. . .with no preexisting cardiac vascular disease.”\n\n“If you take a woman entering the normal, perimenopausal to menopausal state, and she has no preexisting cardiovascular disease. . .the data make it pretty clear there’s no increase in her risk of cardiovascular disease ongoing.” \nIs it safe for older women to receive HRT?\n\nHowever, that doesn’t mean that older women must never take it\nIn fact, that increased risk of cardiovascular events is seen generally only during the first year that a woman starts hormones\n\nHypothetical case:\n\n60 year old women\nShe went into menopause at 50, so she has a window now that is 10 years\nThere is zero evidence that she has existing cardiovascular disease\nShe begins hormone replacement therapy\n\n⇒ How clear are the data that she is also not increasing her risk of cardiovascular disease?\n\nYes, “she’s probably okay”\n“But… we are not here trying to increase sales of hormones”\n\n“What we want to do is empower women so that they are not to be given some curt answer when they ask about [their doctor] about it. This is a legitimate course of action to follow, but with and after a discussion with your physician.”\nDefining the risks\nAnother hypothetical case study:\n\nA woman who has never been on hormones\nmore than 10 years out of menopause\nWith some preexisting clinical or subclinical atherosclerosis\n\n⇒ Is her risk only one year after starting therapy and then it returns to baseline?\n\nHer risk is highest during that first year\nAnd then it diminishes and diminishes and diminishes. \nSo, if during the first year an event doesn’t occur, the likelihood is they will be well and won’t have one of these events later on\n\nHow long do symptoms of menopause last?\n\nMost people think a 60 year old woman who took hormones eight years ago and has not been on them anymore, can’t possibly have symptoms… \nNo, they do indeed can have symptoms\nThe average length of time a woman has symptoms during menopause is seven years\nFor some women, it’s 10 or 12 or 15\nAvrum even has patients in their 70s who are still suffering from menopause\n\nPapers showing HRT is beneficial for heart disease\n\nEstrogen and coronary heart disease in women.\n1991 report that estrogen can help reduce the incidence of heart disease\n\nSee chapter 3 of Estrogen Matters for more on this topic with references\nThe benefits of estrogen on bone health, and the incidence and mortality of hip fractures [1:33:15]\n“We now know that as many women in the United States will die each year of a hip fracture as the number who will die of breast cancer.”\nMortality and hip fractures\n",

And that we’re taking too many medications and too many drugs and so forth and so forth. And with much of this I completely agree, but the alternative to over medicalizing our problems is not to under medicalize them either. . .\n. . .I think that many women influenced, properly, by feminist critiques of medicine think that there’s something unfeminist about taking HRT. Something anti woman about taking HRT. ‘I’m not enough of a woman if I need to take hormones’, or that kind of argument. And I think it’s as much a feminist argument to say what is best for women overall, what is best for a particular woman who is dealing with symptoms that are painful and difficult and complex.”\n“The issue of HRT for women is not that there’s a correct ideological stance to be taken, but rather one that needs to look at what is best for most women, and for any given woman, making this decision.”\nEstriol and testosterone\n\nEstriol: We don’t have large scale studies on estriol, so Avrum advises to be cautious\nTestosterone: It has been associated with the development of breast cancer\n\n“It can show some stimulation of growth of breast cancer in culture, and that too has to be looked at very carefully.”\n\n\n\nWhat kind of research needs to be done to answer the remaining questions about the benefits and risks of HRT?

Epidemiology may in fact have less of the data crisis when the intervention is simpler and certainly taking HRT is simpler than remembering what you ate over the past seven days.\n2 it is impossible to eliminate healthy user bias from epidemiology and thus this must always be acknowledged\n3 We are lulled into a false sense of confidence with randomized control trials, and yet virtually all of them have some measure of what’s called performance bias… “just because something is a randomized control trial, doesn’t mean it is free of bias”\nFor more on the biases associated with epidemiology, check out the Nerd Safari: Studying Studies: Part III – the motivation for observational studies\nThe demands on researchers to publish something important leads to bad science:\n“The demands on researchers to publish or perish has meant a proliferation of badly analyzed studies. So this is where you’re an epidemiologist, you’ve got thousands and thousands of people in your sample, and you don’t find what you thought you would find.
