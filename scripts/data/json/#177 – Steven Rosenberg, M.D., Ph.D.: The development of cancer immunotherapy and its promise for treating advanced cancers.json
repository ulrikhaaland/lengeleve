Steve is a pioneer in the field of immunotherapies for cancer and a recipient of nearly every major award in science. In this episode, Steve discusses his inspiration for devoting his career to cancer research and describes his keen observation of two cases of spontaneous cancer remission, driving him to learn how to harness the immune system to treat cancer. Steve’s personal story essentially serves as a roadmap for the field of immunotherapy, from the very non-specific therapies such as interleukin-2, the discovery of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T-cells, and adoptive cell therapy. Perhaps most importantly, Steve expresses his optimism for what lies ahead, especially in the face of some of the more recent discoveries with respect to tumor antigenicity. Finally, Steve discusses the human side of cancer which helps him to never lose sight of why he chose to become a physician.\n*WATCH PODCAST ON YOUTUBE*\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE |

brother would talk about going out west, riding horses, and doing exciting things\nAt age 5 or 6 at the end of the Second World War he remembers clearly the tragedies of the Holocaust\n\nThis made a huge impression on him how evil people could be towards one another.\nAround that time, he developed an almost spiritual desire to become a doctor, to do research and make progress in helping people, in alleviating suffering rather than causing suffering \nInspiration to become a doctor developed in response to the horrors of that time\nHis commitment to research aims to alleviate suffering in the future \n\n\nSteve’s education [6:10]\n\nAccepted to Johns Hopkins, the very best medical school for a combined bachelor’s MD degree, a 6-year program\n\nThis was in the late fifties and early sixties\nIt was 3 years of college and 3 years of medical school\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Hopkins there were brilliant people around, and Steve recounts “I think is probably one of the single most important components of a good education…being surrounded by people who know a lot more than you, can inspire you”\nAfter finishing his MD Steve wanted further education\n\n“But I knew from the very beginning that I wasn’t just going to try to practice today’s science, practice today’s medicine, but rather try to create the medicine of tomorrow and that stuck with me for these last 60 or 70 years or so.” – Steve Rosenberg\n\nHe went on to get a Ph.D. in biophysics at Harvard\n\nHe wanted to be able to grasp any area of science and use it to answer questions and thought maybe differential equations would be helpful \nEnded up doing a lot a math in graduate school\nFor 2 years he did nothing but study, take classes, and learn \nThe last 2 years of his Ph.D. was focused on research, studying cell membranes, physical chemistry and protein chemistry \nHe wanted a good enough broad background in the sciences so if he encountered a problem he could get a good book, read some papers, and understand it.\n\n\n\n“I never wanted to be intimidated by what I did not know.” —Steve Rosenberg\n\nHigh school biology and college classes inspired his interest in cancer\nTiming of his Ph.D. and residency [10:00]\n\nAfter medical school began his surgical residency at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital \nNext he took four years off to get a Ph.D. in biophysics at Harvard\nIt was a year of internship, four years off to get a Ph.D., then back to the residency\nThen came down to the NIH for several years to join the immunology branch in 1974 (during the Vietnam War)\n\nIt was unusual for someone to leave their internship to go into a Ph.D. program at that time\n\n\n\n\n\n“I was just not satisfied after medical school, the college of medical school that I really knew enough to do creditable, meaningful, impactful, research.” – Steven Rosenberg\n\nPeter asks if Franny Moore the most significant figure in his life at that point in time as a mentor?\nSteve recounts “Franny Moore was the chief of surgery and an incredibly smart person,Franny stood out in that discussing a problem or patient it wouldn’t be at all surprising for him to come up with an idea or a perspective on a problem that most people had not considered. ”\nHe got support to leave his residency to get a Ph.D. \n\nHe had a few extra meetings, but Franny was patient because Steve came back for a year then went to the NIH as part of the Vietnam draft obligation\nSteve set a record at Brigham for taking 11 years from the time he started his internship to the time he finished the residency\n\nThis would have been old for a chief resident at the time\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPatients that influenced Steve’s thinking about cancer and altered the course of his career [13:15]\nThe Transformed Cell\n",

I may also possess the record for most copies owned, which I know you got a kick out of that.” – Peter Attia\nIn 1968, Steve met two patients in the ER that altered the course of his career…\n\nSteve was a junior resident at the West Roxbury VA Hospital\nA 68-year-old fellow who came in complaining of right upper quadrant pain \nIt looked like a typical gallbladder attack, and Steve was excited because he might be able to perform one of his first operations\nHis chart contained a remarkable story\n\n11 or 12 years earlier, that patient had been seen at the West Roxbury VA Hospital\nHe had gastric cancer (a stomach cancer) and underwent a laparotomy\nThe surgeon at the time noted a tumor encompassing about three-quarters of the stomach; there were multiple liver metastasis deposits that were biopsied and shown to be the gastric cancer that had spread, multiple enlarged lymph nodes\nPart of the stomach was removed and the rest of the disease was left in place\nThe patient recovered and about a week later, went home\nThis was now 12 years later; the patient has lived 10-11 years normally after this\nSteve took part in removing his gallbladder and noticed his belly was completely clean of cancer \n\n\n\n“It was a cancer that had spontaneously disappeared over time in the absence of any therapy.  One of the rarest events in medicine, and that is to have the spontaneous regression of cancer without any treatments being given. ” – Steven Rosenberg\n\nSteve wondered whether or not this patient who had somehow cured his own cancer could be somehow taken advantage of to treat other patients\n\n\n\n\nThere just so happened to be another patient in the hospital with a gastric cancer, a veteran who also had the same blood type\nSteve called up the head of the surgery department, Brownie Wheeler, and said, “Hey, I want to take a blood transfusion from this patient who spontaneously was cured and give it to this other patient.” \n\nIt was approved, the IRB (as it existed at that time)\nHe got blood from this one patient and infused it into the other veteran, but of course, it didn’t do anything and the other patient ended up dying of his gastric cancer \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt planted the seed that in fact, maybe there was something in the immune system that caused the rejection of that cancer much as it would a foreign transplant\n\n\n\n\nThe immune system is the body’s major defense mechanism against foreign invaders, and it got me thinking about potential immune manipulations\nSteve was impacted by a second patient he saw about a year before he came to the Brigham as an intern\n\nPatient received an early kidney transplant; the kidney inadvertently contained renal cancer\nUnder the influence of immunosuppressant medications, the cancer spread widely through his body\nIn an attempt to control this, the immunosuppressant medications were stopped\nOf course, the kidney rejected and had to be removed, but the patient’s cancer then went away as well because it too was allogeneic; it too came from the genome of the original donor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Steve, this was a huge inspiration that the immune system could be utilized to treat cancer\n\n“A large invasive vascularized cancer could be caused to reject completely by the immune system if you had a strong enough stimulus that could mediate that rejection.”  – Steven Rosenberg \n \nThe discovery of antigen presentation, Steve’s first job, and why he knew he wanted to study cancer [19:30]\n1950s-1970s\n\nMHC class I and class II molecules were discovered in the mid 70’s-80’s; \n\nThey present antigens to T lymphocytes and are essential for an adaptive immune response\n\n\nMHC class I and class II molecules were discovered in the mid 70’s – early 80’s\nCancer antigens were unknown and there was no ability to measure an immune reaction against any cancer\nVery little immunology was understood at this time; Steve recalls \n\n“In the 1957 issue of the Journal of Immunology, the word lymphocyte was not in the index.” \n\n\n\n\nIn the 1950’s, there was no understanding of what lymphocytes do. \nIn the 60’s it became know that one could transfer immunity in experimental animals by transferring lymphocytes, and this was different from transferring blood or serum\n\n\nIn the 60’s one could immunize a mouse against a tumor by letting it grow and then removing it and cause that mouse to resist an implantation of the same tumor again. But once the tumor was growing, there was no maneuver that could keep it from growing, no immunologic maneuver that could keep it from growing\n\nThe field was desperately in need of more information\n\n\n\nSteve’s first job \n\nFinished his residency June 30th, 1974 and was appointed the next day as Chief of Surgery at the National Cancer Institute\n\nAn usual first job\nAnd a position he still holds 47 years later\n\n\nThe NIH is a remarkable place\n\n“It’s a state-of-the-art hospital that provides outstanding care to patients, but it exists again, not only to practice the best of today’s medicine but to create the medicine of tomorrow and that always intrigued me from my first knowledge of the NIH when I came here in the midst of the residency during the Vietnam War.” – Steven Rosenberg \n\nJob offers: stay at the Brigham at Harvard, go to Dana-Farber.  \n\nSteve was offered the position of chief of surgery at both places\nFranny Moore at the Brighman at Harvard was extremely disappointed that Steve was leaving for the NIH to become Chief of Surgery at the National Cancer Institute (NCI)\nSteve reminisces on his desire to study cancer stemming from early childhood\n\n\n\n“Cancer is a Holocaust and just seemed like the kind of thing I wanted to study.” —Steve Rosenberg\n\nThe impact of  Richard Nixon’s War on Cancer \n\nWould cancer be eradicated in the same way that man had gone to the moon?\n\n\nThe National Cancer Act mainly influenced funding outside of the NIH \nFrom the perspective of a worker bee, the National Cancer Act didn’t have much impact where he was at NCI\n\n \nCancer treatment in the early 1970’s and Steve’s intuition to utilize lymphocytes [26:45]\nSteve’s early research agenda at the NIH\n\nIn the early 70’s cancer was treated with simple surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy; these were mostly used alone\n\nThe surgical approach was 3000 years old\nRadiation therapy began immediately after Wilhelm Röntgen discovered x-rays in 1895 \nChemotherapy arose in biological and chemical warfare laboratories here at Fort Dietrich in Dietrich, Maryland in 1942 in a laboratory accident when lab technicians were inadvertently exposed to nitrogen mustard. \n\nLymphopenia and shrinking lymph nodes in these technicians was observed leading a Yale physician to use nitrogen mustard (now known as melphalan) as a chemotherapy agent.  \n\n\n\n\nAdvances in the use of chemicals to treat cancer were slow and incremental\nSteve wanted something that would make a big difference and his intuition told him immunology was the key\n\nHe knew immune cells were the key to organ rejection\nHe was focused on finding agents to stimulate the immune system to fight cancer\n\n\n\nEarly experiment, a learning experience\n\nSteve describes his first experiments as unbelievably naive [29:30]\nIn 1974 there was no way to keep lymphocytes alive outside the body\nHe began implanting tumors in mini pigs \nHis friend Davis Sachs developed a mini pig colony that was partially inbred at the MHC loci\nSteve used these pigs to embed tumors in the mesentery\nSteve treated 6 patients by removing their tumor, implant it in the mesentery of a mini pig, remove nearby lymph nodes 2 weeks later, recover lymphocytes, and intravenously give these lymphocytes back to the patient\n\nThis was his first attempt to generate lymphocytes specific for a tumor\nNothing happened\nSteve recalls the quote by Louis Pasteur saying that said chance favors the prepared mind and added to it\n\n\n\n“chance favors the prepared mind only if the mind is at work” – Steve Rosenberg\n\n\n\nT-cell growth factor (later named IL-2) was discovered in 1976 by Morgan, Ruscetti, and Gallo  \n\n\n\n\nThis allowed T lymphocytes (T-cells) to be grown outside the body and was something Steve began to study quite intensively\n\n \nCancer cells vs. non-cancer cells, and why metastatic cancer is so deadly [31:45]\nWhat separates a cancer cell from a non cancer cell?\n\nSteve notes there are two properties that separate cancer from other cells in the body\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first is uncontrolled growth\nThe second is it’s the only cell that can arise in one part of the body and spread and live and divide and grow in another part of the body (metastasis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA normal cell becomes a cancer cell due to the accumulation of mutations in DNA as these cells divide\n\n\n\n\nMistakes occur randomly during cell division\nCancer can be described but it doesn’t mean we understand it all\n\n\nDifferences between epithelial tumors and hematologic tumors and the odds of survival \n\nHematological cancers are blood cancers; they begin from progenitors (stem cells) in the hematopoietic system\n\nAbout 10% of all cancer deaths are due to hematological cancers \n\n\nEpithelial cancers begin in the solid organs of the body\n\n All organs have ducts, and it’s the epithelial lining of the ducts that are turning over that become the cancer\nAbout 90% of all cancer deaths are due to epithelial cancers\nLast year in the United States, there were about 600,000 deaths due to cancer, 550,000 were due to solid epithelial cancers\nOperating on these patients to remove the cancer cures over half\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadly metastatic cancer\n“a dirty little secret of oncology, and that is that if a cancer spreads from its local site and cannot be surgically removed, then the death rate in that patient is 100%” – Steve Rosenberg\n\n\n\nThere are virtually no treatments that can cure a patient with a metastatic, solid cancer (this is a cancer that has spread to another site in the body)\n\n\n\n\nThere were 2 exceptions (now 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoriocarcinoma are cancers that begin in the placenta of a pregnant woman then spread; the chemotherapy drug methotrexate will cause it to disappear, but we still don’t understand why\nGerm cell tumors in testes of males can be treated with platinum derived chemotherapy regimens (such as cisplatin) resulting in complete, durable regression of metastatic disease, no matter how much they’ve spread\nWith the application of IL-2 metastatic melanoma and renal cancer are now treatable \n\n\n\n\nTreatment of metastatic cancer improves survival but ultimately everyone succumbs to disease, median survival has been extended but not overall survival\n\n \nThe problem with chemotherapy and promise of immunotherapy [38:30]\nHow has survival changed over the last 50 years for common cancers?\n\nMetastatic colorectal cancer – median survival in the mid-70’s would have been 8-10 months; now it’s 2.5 years\nBreast cancer patients go from one treatment regime to another causing temporary regression of cancer, each prolonging life by a few weeks\nTreating pancreatic cancer with Erlotinib prolongs survival by 6 weeks\n\nPeter notes the cost of $40,000\nSteve agrees, this comes with a huge, life altering expense and enormous toxicity\n\n\nThe most frequently prescribed drug in oncology today is Avastin, bevacizumab, which can impact blood vessels and tumors\n\nCombining Avastin with other treatments will prolong survival in patients with colorectal cancer by about 4.5 months\n\n\nHow good is chemotherapy at killing cancer cells?\n\nThe challenge is selectivity; how does one kill cancer and at the same time not kill normal cells? \n\n\n\n“I think that’s an important point that many people don’t understand, which is how difficult it is to thread the needle of chemotherapy. It’s not the killing of cancer that’s hard. It’s the killing of cancer and not killing the non-cancer.” – Peter Attia  \n\nSelective killing of cancer without killing normal cells does not occur for virtually any cancer treatment: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or even surgery\n\n\nThis is the promise of immunotherapy, its immense selectivity and sensitivity of recognition; it can recognize a single amino acid change in a protein and develop an immune response against it\n\n \nHow the immune system works and why it seems to allow cancer to proliferate [43:15]\nConsider a viral infection, whether it’s the common cold or Coronavirus \n\n\n\nThe virus infects respiratory epithelium and replicates in these cells\nInfected cells express viral proteins\nThe immune system has evolved to detect proteins or other molecules that are not part of the normal cells of the body\nB lymphocytes (B cells) make antibodies\nT lymphocytes (T cells) act by directly interacting with other tissues\nEvery 14 or 15 seconds, the heart is pumping out lymphocytes, they are circulating through the vascular system, sometimes extravasating into tissues, coming back into the lymphoid system and returning to the heart via the thoracic duct",

It was one of the few eureka moments that I’ve had in doing research.” – Steve Rosenberg\n\n\n\nComparing the process of fine-tuning the use of IL-2 in treating cancer to Thomas Starzl’s work in the 1960’s with liver transplantation \n\nMany patients died before successful liver transplantation was achieved\nThere were many technical aspects to be worked out: perioperative care, postoperative care, the technical skill necessary, plus the immunosuppressive regimen\nSteve notes that for liver transplantation there were technical problems to be overcome and immunotherapy for cancer is different\n\nDidn’t know if if would ever work\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks how many different histologies/ cancers was Steve treating with IL-2\n\nSteve was treating all metastatic cancers hoping that there would be commonalities that could be attacked\nThe first patient treated with the revised regimen had melanoma\nThe third and forth patients had renal cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve found that 2 types of cancers would respond to IL-2: melanoma and renal cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe response rates turned out to be 15-20% with about a third of these patients having complete, durable regression of cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n“And so that first patient had an enormous impact on me and on the field because it showed that it was possible.” – Steve Rosenberg\n\nThis led him to study cell transfer, gene modification, and so on\nHow did Steve keep going in the face of those failures until this patient’s miraculous remission in 1984? [59:00]\n\nSteve remembers the patient’s he failed to help more than those that did well \nThere was a remarkable number of tragedies, people of all ages\n\n\nA strong intuition based on all he had studied and the success of 2 early cancer patients kept him pursuing immunotherapy\nSteve quotes Abraham Lincoln to describe his work ethic, “Success consists of moving from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm” \n\n“And when that first patient responded, it all exploded in my brain. It does work. This can work.” – Steve Rosenberg\nHow support from Steve’s family made his important work possible \n\nSteve’s wife Alice was unbelievably supportive\n\n“There were probably, and I’m not exaggerating, 40 days in the first 40 years of my work here that I was in town, not traveling, that I was not in this hospital. I would come in every day, of course, I would come in every Saturday, Sunday; I would come in to go over research with some of the fellows, you probably remember that, or see some patients.” – Steve Rosenberg\n\nThere are a lot of wives that would not have tolerated that but Alice took care of the burdens we commonly face as part of daily living  \n\n“ I doubt I could’ve done it without that kind of support.” – Steve Rosenberg\n\nThe immunogenic nature of certain cancers and the role of mutations in cancer [1:03:45]\n“Patient 67”\n\n\n\nThis patient illuminated how melanoma and renal cancer are particularly immunogenic relative to the host of other epithelial cancers that were less reactive  \nInitially this was unknown, but 35 years later Steve thinks he understands what is different about melanoma\n\nSaw responses to IL-2 in patients with melanoma and kidney cancer, but no other diseases\nLearned the hard way by treating over 600 patients with IL-2 at the Clinical Center \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe success of treating melanoma with IL-2 had to do with the vast number of mutations in this type of cancer, about 400 mutations per tumor\n\n\n\n\nThe immune system recognizes the products of mutations\nMelanoma is induced by a carcinogen, UV light\n\nPeter asks about Lynch Syndrome since patients with this disease would typically have many mutations as well \nSteven explains they didn’t understand mutations were involved at the time\nSteven doesn’t remember ever treating a patient with Lynch Syndrome\n\n\n\n\n\n“There’s no such thing as a standard cancer, right?” – Peter Attia\nWhat is the median number of mutations found in common cancers?\n\n80% of common cancers have between 60 to 70 and 150 mutations;
