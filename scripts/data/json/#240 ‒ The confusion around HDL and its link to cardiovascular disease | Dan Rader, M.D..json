    "content": "Show Notes*Notes from intro:\n\nDan Rader is a Professor of Molecular Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, where he conducts translational research on lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis\nHis focus is on the metabolism and function of high density lipoproteins (HDLs)\nDan has received numerous awards and has been elected to the American Society of Clinical Investigation, the Association of American Physicians, and the National Academy of Medicine\nHe currently serves on the board of directors of the International Society of Atherosclerosis, the Board of External Experts at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, and the advisory board for the clinical research of the NIH\nThis episode is the first time we focus our entire conversation around HDLs\nNow, as any listener of this podcast will know, we have no shortage of content around lipids, and we focus a lot of that energy on the apoB side of the family\n\nThat is LDLs and  Lp(a), a subset of LDL\n\n\nHDL biology is much more complex than LDL biology, and we know so much less\nPeople generally think of HDL as the “good cholesterol”, but you have no doubt heard Peter rail on the stupidity of such a designation\n\nBut there is clearly something good about HDLs (as in the lipoproteins, not the cholesterol)\n\n\nIn this discussion we really talk about everything from the biology of the HDL, its genesis, its origin, its metabolism, its life cycle, to its function\nWe also talk about why it has been so complicated to use pharmacologic interventions on the HDL side of the equation to impact atherosclerosis\nPerhaps the greatest success of modern medicine, especially as it comes to cardiovascular disease, has been our ability to manipulate the apoB side of the equation as opposed to the apoA side of the equation\nIn this episode we will get into terminology such as apoA in the context of HDLs \n\nWhich has no bearing whatsoever to apo- little a [apolipoprotein(a), the thing that of course defines a Lp(a)] \n\n\nWe talk about the genesis of the HDL, its structure, its metabolism\nWe talk about the differences between HDLs, LDLs, the difference between the HDL measurements\nWe explain the difference between HDL cholesterol versus apoA concentration versus HDL particle number\nWe talk about the idea that having a high HDL means you don’t need to worry about cardiovascular disease and how that’s obviously going to be bunk\nWe speak about CETP inhibitors, which are a class of drug that have been repeatedly used to try to increase HDL cholesterol with the hopes that that would reduce cardiovascular disease\nWe end the conversation around some of the new thinking around HDL and neurodegenerative disease (something Peter learned a lot about)\nTom Dayspring recommended Dan highly, and anytime Tom Dayspring says, “You should have so and so on the podcast to talk about anything that has to do with lipids,” Peter immediately pays attention\n\n \nThe lipidology of apoB and apoA [4:00]\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two families of lipids‒ the apoB family and the apoA family\n\nWe have spent much more time talking about the apoB family, and our understanding of its causal relationship to pathology is more clear\n\n\n\nWhere do these two families fit into the border architecture of our existence? \n\nLipoproteins are these big complexes that evolved to transport lipids within the blood\nLipids are like oil: they don’t mix well with water\n\nOil droplets float to the top of a puddle\nWe wouldn’t be able to transport lipids in the blood if we hadn’t evolved a mechanism to do that; and lipoproteins are that mechanism\n\n\nAs their names suggest, lipoproteins have lipid in their core, and then they have proteins that dot the surface\n\nThe proteins allow them to be transported in very complex and sophisticated ways within the bloodstream \n\nIn terms of how they’re metabolized in terms of the receptors they bind to\nIn terms of the specific proteins and lipids that they carry\n\n\n\n\nPeter has talked a lot about apoB lipoproteins in previous podcasts; they’re really fabulous\nApoB lipoproteins evolved to transport triglycerides as a source of energy, from the gut to adipose and muscle and heart, as well as from the liver (during times when we’re fasting)\n\nThey’re very important in terms of causal relationship to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)\n\n\nHDL is a very complex lipoprotein",

Unfortunately, because of the insolubility of both cholesterol, triglyceride, lipids, etc., we have to come up with this more complicated system.” \n\nThe nomenclature gets confusing; clarify the difference between apoA and Lp(a) \n\nWhen you talk about apoA, it’s important to realize we are not talking about Lp(a) \nLp(a) is not the topic of today’s discussion; this is totally different\nApoA has a capital A after it, and the most important one is ApoA-I\n\nTechnically there are two lineages of apoBs \n\nApoB-100 is what we refer to virtually all the time we say apoB\nThis is in contrast to apoB-48, which is on chylomicrons used to transport lipids/ energy from the gut\n\n \nA primer on the high-density lipoprotein (HDL): genesis, structure, and more [9:30]\nThe genesis of the high density lipoprotein (HDL) \n\nHDL metabolism is perhaps an order of magnitude even more complex than LDL\nPeter agrees, “It is hands down the most confusing stuff in the lipid space”\nApoA-I as the key protein with HDL\nThe analogy is to apoB [on LDL] as Peter alluded to\n\nAlthough one big difference is apoB stays with the LDL particle throughout its lifetime\nApoB gets made by the intestine as B48 or the liver as B100, and it stays with that particle\nEach LDL has one molecule of this huge apoB protein, and then it ultimately gets taken up mostly by the liver after its time in the blood\n\n\nApoA-I is also made by the intestine and the liver\nIt is a core protein of HDL, but unlike apoB, there are several molecules of apoA-I on any given HDL particle (anywhere from 1-4, maybe more)\nApoA-I doesn’t stay with the particle, it can exchange onto other types of HDL particles, but even sometimes onto apoB lipoproteins\nIn the last decade we have learned that apoA-I is a secreted protein put into the blood by either the intestinal enterocyte or the hepatocyte in the liver as a free protein (more or less)\nOne of the first steps that has to happen for HDL to be formed is that once HDL comes out of the cell, it engages with a key transport protein called ABCA1\n\nABCA1 takes lipid, cholesterol, phospholipids from the cell and exports them to newly secreted apoA-I\n\n\n\nApoA-I has to acquire lipid soon after it has been secreted in order for nascent or early HDL to start forming; this is the first step in HDL biogenesis  \n\nWe’ll come back to this when we talk about genetics because humans who lack ABCA1 have virtually undetectable HDL\n\nThey can make plenty of ApoA-I but cannot protect it with lipid once it’s secreted, and so it “goes like a rocket from the blood”\n\n\n\nWhat other phenotype do people without ABCA1 have? \n\nThis disorder is called Tangier disease; studying rare human genetic disorders tells us a lot about what specific proteins/ genes are doing\n\nIt’s named for a small, flat, bizarre island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay where the first patient was discovered\n\n\nThis disorder is primarily associated with accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages throughout the body (tonsils and spleen)\n\nCholesterol accumulates in places where there are a lot of macrophages\n\n\nPeople with this disease will have orange colored tonsils\nThey have big spleens that sometimes rupture, they have big livers (because there are a lot of macrophages and macrophages-like cells in the liver)",

A lot of these animals have a very different apoB side of the equation, and Peter is curious about apoA-I? \n\nApoA-I is highly conserved among mammals\nIn mice, more than 90% of the cholesterol in the blood is in HDL\n\n This is true for all mammals\n\n\nOnce you start getting below mammals, things change in terms of lipoprotein metabolism\nThere are thoughts that HDL is the primordial lipoprotein that evolved early as a transport system for lipids within circulatory systems in lower species\n\nAnd that the apoB system evolved subsequently\n\n\nPeter has never heard a convincing argument for why humans have apoB, when it seems that every other species gets away without it\nMany animals (mice, dogs, pics, rabbits) make apoB in both the gut and liver\n",

This person looks super healthy.”\nYou give them a high fat shake and after 30 minutes start measuring from their blood every couple minutes\n\nMost people would not be surprised to learn that the triglycerides will go through the roof (400-500 mg/dL)\nBut this is highly variable from person to person\nAnd highly dependent on the meal\n\n\nIn this experiment, you’re giving them something to elicit the biggest triglyceride response\n\nLet’s say their triglycerides go all the way to 400 before they start to come down, and that generates an area under the curve \n\n\nYou could integrate that on the curve\n\nCan you give realistic values for what the HDL cholesterol would do during that period of time?  \n\nThe HDL cholesterol definitely dips during that time in a way that’s roughly proportional to the triglyceride levels, but not anywhere near the same degree of magnitude\nIt’s starting lower, but also the dynamics of its turnover are very different\nThe key point here is HDL is not just an integrator acutely over that meal, but chronically \nIn this example, the HDL cholesterol might go from 40 to 38 or 37, which doesn’t sound like a lot after that one meal\nBut the repeated meals that the individual is eating that are high fat and that repeated triglyceride excursion has a more chronic effect\n\nA little like glucose and HbA1c that keeps taking the HDL down over time until you get to a new steady state\n\n\nSo, the acute effect on the HDL is real, it’s modest\nThe chronic effect on the HDL of that abnormal postprandial triglyceride metabolism is quite substantial, and that’s why HDL is a good integrator of this effect\nPeter thinks this probably captures some of what’s happening outside of the meal\n\nJust as hemoglobin A1C doesn’t only reflect what would be captured in an oral glucose tolerance test, it captures what’s happening over 90 straight days when you’re eating, when you’re not eating\n\n\nDan adds, “And that’s also why there’s a very strong statistical relationship between fasting triglycerides and the HDL. So, the fasting triglycerides themselves are still affecting HDL metabolism. It’s just that the postprandial part is also a key component.”\n\nReiterate the lagging nature of HDL cholesterol through HDL biology to what’s happening with the efficiency of lipid partitioning by considering a hypothetical experiment  \n\nLagging nature refers to the integrating over time\nSay you have two people who are exercising, and they are very similar except one is very insulin resistant and one is insulin sensitive  \nThe insulin resistant person is going to have a higher level of insulin\n\nThey’re going to have a more difficult time oxidizing free fatty acids\nAs energy demand goes up from the muscle, they are more likely to utilize glycogen as opposed to utilizing triglycerides\nYou might notice more fat in their liver, even when they’re not eating\n\n\nPeter asks, “What is the HDL doing in those two scenarios?” \nThe simplest most direct model is that the HDL is reflecting the 24-hour excursions and triglycerides \nThere are almost certainly other components of metabolism that the HDL is integrating and reflecting, particularly in the complex insulin resistance world\nWe know insulin resistance has a lot of effects other than affecting triglycerides, and insulin resistance \n\nInsulin resistance has effects that are affecting and are reflected by the lowering of HDL, though Dan can’t tell you is exactly what those are",
