In fact, I come into this episode truly knowing as little as a layperson would know about the eye, and I think at the outside of the interview, I explain the extent to what I know about the eye. While it may be slightly more than you will know, I promise you that within about 15 minutes of this episode we are all going to be at the same level.”\nPeter found this discussion fascinating; he treated it almost like the discussion he would have with Steven if they were at a cocktail party\n\nHe really picks Steven’s brain about the anatomy of the eye\nWhy is this relevant?\nHow does it factor into the natural processes of aging?\nHow does that differ from some of the pathologic processes that also tend to increase with age, but are not necessarily related to aging, per se.?\n\n\nThis episode gets into the really simple fundamentals— what is nearsightedness? \n\nWhat is farsightedness? \nWhat is presbyopia, which by the way Peter used to think was farsightedness till he did this interview\n\n\nAlso discussed are what the treatments look like for these things\n\nIncluding a very nuanced discussion about how the different treatments might be beneficial to some people versus others\n\n\nLASIK eye surgery will be explained as well as a procedure that came along slightly before that’s called PRK\nSteven will talk a little bit about a procedure that is coming online today, called SMILE\nAll three of these surgeries are similar, but they differ in fundamental ways, and that can be an important thing to consider for someone in the market for one of these procedures\nEye health is also discussed\n\nWhat are the things that one can do? \nWhat can be done to maximize eye health in our kids?\n\n\nAlso discussed are some of the real epidemics that are going on in myopia\n\nThat is to say, kids that are requiring glasses earlier and earlier\nWhat could be the cause of this and what can be done in our kids to prevent those things, and also in ourselves, what we can be doing\nA lot of stuff is covered in this episode\n\n\n\n“This is really the everything you need to know about the eye episode” – Peter Attia\n \nWhy Steven chose ophthalmology, and the crossovers to other medical disciplines [3:45]\n\nThe eye is a topic that everybody has questions on, Peter included \nFrom medical school, Peter remembers there is an optic nerve, a cranial nerve, and the second cranial nerve (this is the optic nerve)\n\nHe remembers something called fovea, and he knows there’s a blind spot, but he’s forgotten why\n\n\nPeter remarks, “It’s safe to say my knowledge of this topic right now is probably at par with everybody’s right?” \nSteven understands, “Well, that’s not rare, frankly, because the eye is so literally compartmentalized. We just don’t interact that much with other specialties, so it’s not rare for people who are in other specialties to be very ignorant of the eyeball, and that’s fine because I think it’ll help us keep the level of discussion at an approachable level for everyone.” \nPeter asks if there has ever been discussion suggesting that ophthalmologists don’t need to do the four-year MD degree\n\nHow much of what was learned in medical school became relevant in residency?\n\n\nSteven says there was quite a lot\n\nThere’s nothing specifically magical about the eyeball\nIt’s got neurological tissue in the back, actual brain tissue in the back",

You’re really training to become an eye surgeon.” \n\nBut there are, for example, neuro-ophthalmologists, which are really more neurologists than eye surgeons; they don’t do eye surgery\nThere are some ophthalmologists who don’t do eye surgery\n\n\nPeter recalls one of his lasting memories from residency was stealing suture from the ophthalmology OR at Hopkins \n\nAs the number of the suture gets larger the suture itself gets smaller\nAn O suture is thick, like a piece of rope\nThe scale progresses from 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, etc\nBy a 4-0 suture, it’s actually quite thin\n\n\nSteven replies they use an 11-0 suture\nCardiac surgery uses a 7-0\n\nOccasionally there’s some guys that would sew the distal end of a coronary artery with an 8-0 and at that level, it’s already very thin; just the slightest tug too much, and it breaks\n\n\nPeter recalls about ophthalmology, “you guys wrote 11-0, and so I used to steal 11-0 constantly every night I was on call and practice suturing with 11-0. The thinking being, if you can tie in 11-0 with your hands and not tear it, that 7-0, which normally is like a piece of hair is going to feel like a piece of rope. I used it to help me develop a good feel for fine suture” \nThe tools in ophthalmology are tiny and Steven can remember the operating room where he did his training was near orthopedic surgery \n\n“You hear this Black and Decker stuff going on over there, and our little tiny tools are very, it’s just totally different” – Steven Dell \n\nEverything he does operationally is under a microscope\n\nThey use a binocular microscope\nSo he’s looking through both eyes, and this is either mounted from the ceiling and is controlled by his feet\n\nThe X, Y, and Z, and the zoom focus are controlled by a foot pedal\nAnd that either comes from the ceiling or it’s on a really large stand\n\n\n\n\nHe’s sitting and looking straight ahead, so the image is here, but he operating down below\n\nIt’s interesting because sometimes his wife will kid him, I’ll come home from a day of surgery exhausted, but she says something like, “well, I don’t really get it. You’re just sitting in a chair, making these little tiny movements, and there’s soft music playing. It all seems very, very sedate.” \nIt’s incredibly stressful and exhausting\n\n\nOphthalmologists  have a problem where they tend to hyperextend\n\nThey tend to bring their head forward, to come up to the oculars and that creates a whole other set of problems\nThere are ergonomic challenges for sure, and he remembers early on in his career, he was coached very carefully on how to sit, how to have his spine arranged\n\nOne doesn’t want to crane their neck forward\nHe  has to make sure his shoulders are down\n\n",

They’re in a very, very compromised and stressful position, and then they tend to lift their hands up.” \nThe surgical movements are these little tiny movements, so very small positional changes can have a huge impact on the outcome of the surgery\n\n\nPeter understands this problem, he has 2 friends from residency who required multiple neck surgeries\n\nOne of them could no longer operate after his surgery; he trained as a cardiac surgeon and now does cardiac critical care\n\nIt’s still a great career, but after 10 years of training as a cardiac surgeon, to not be able to operate…\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks if Steven knew he wanted to do ophthalmology when he began medical school\nNo, but he knew he wanted to do something surgical, something with his hands\nHe remember a Eureka moment where the first time he looked through a slit lamp (which is basically a microscope to look into the eye) he was hooked\n\nThis was during an ophthalmology rotation in a weeks where they did a little  ophthalmology and a little ear, nose, and throat\nIt was then that he knew ophthalmology was what he wanted to do\nHe had some exposure to ophthalmology prior because the father of one of his friends was an ophthalmologist\n\n\nPeter asks if ophthalmologists do a general surgery internship\nSome do; Steven did what is referred to as a transitional residence internship, where one does a little bit of everything: general surgery, internal medicine\n\nIt was very helpful\nThe general surgery part was rough, but it was nice to have exposure to a little bit of everything\n\n\nIt was a 4-year residency, including the internship\nPeter asks what was the “bread and butter”?\n\nFor example, in general surgery in the 1960’s and 1970’s, it would’ve been Billroth procedures and things like that, where the most common thing one was doing was cutting out half of the stomach because of peptic ulcer disease and things like that\nBy the time he got to residency, he never did one of those because H2 blockers and PPIs basically eliminated the need to surgically remove part of the stomach for gastric or peptic ulcers\n\n\nPeter wants to know, at the time of his training, where did 80% of the volume come from? What type of cases?\nIt was cataract surgery and then retinal disease\n\nIt’s still cataracts\nThe scourge of essentially diabetes causes these very, very complex retinal problems\n\n\n\n \nAnatomy of the eye, common types of vision loss, and age-related vision changes [14:15]\n\nWhen Steven explains the eye to a kid, he compared it to a camera with film in the back; that’s the retina\n\nThen the kid looks at his parents and asks, “What’s a camera? Film, what’s that?” \n\n\nThe eye is built like a camera where in the very front is the cornea\n\nThe cornea is the covering on the front of a watch; that’s the thing that a contact lens would sit on\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Anatomy of the eye.  Image credit: Kellogg Eye Center\n\nThe next thing is the pupil, which is the hole in the iris\nBehind that is the lens, it’s really one of a couple of different lenses inside the eye; but the lens behind the pupil\nThen there is the vitreous cavity and in the very back\nThe retina, which attaches to the optic nerve, and that’s what goes to the brain\nImages come in; they’re bent by the cornea first, then bent again by the lens, and then they focus (hopefully) on the retina\nIn a perfectly sized eye, in someone who doesn’t need spectacles to see, images come from say, optical infinity, which is for the purposes of this discussion, is about 20 feet or beyond where light rays come in parallel, and they’re bent so that they fall perfectly on the retina\nPeter asks him to clarify what fraction of the back of the sphere is considered retina\nThe whole back of the eye is coded by retina\n\nBut there is the fovea, mentioned earlier; that’s the point where one casts their gaze",

    "content": "\nThe first thing Steven thinks of is for them to go get their blood sugar checked because glucose can diffuse into the lens and cause it to swell\n\nThis will change the shape of the lens\nThe lens becomes physically bigger; it’s like a thicker, more powerful lens\n\n\nDiffusion of glucose into the lens causes an osmotic change\nThe timeframe for that to happen is over a period of several weeks\nIf the blood sugar goes up there may be a lag of a month or two before the vision change \nAnd when the blood sugar goes down, same thing; it takes weeks for that to go back to normal\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood-retinal barrier\n\nPeter asks if the eye is an immune-privileged site\n\nIs it more or less susceptible to systemic infection?\n\n\nSteven notes the eye itself is certainly prone to damage from systemic infection\nThere is a blood-retinal barrier in the same way that there’s a blood-brain barrier that protects that highly metabolically active retina from systemic disease\nThe lens itself is relatively privileged from an immune standpoint\n\nIt’s within that capsule, and it’s hard for large molecules to get across that, small molecules can\n\n\nPeter notes this is important from a pharmacotherapy standpoint\n\nEye drops in development improve vision by restoring elasticity to the lens\n\nOn that topic, Steven mentions a medication being examined as a way of softening the lens to to maybe break some of the disulfide bonds that become a problem and become one of the reasons why the elasticity of the lens is lost\n\nThis is a lipoic acid choline ester; the safety study was just published \n\n\nPeter clarifies, “You’re saying there might be a day when there’s either an optical or injectable substrate that could go into the lens that could delay the onset of farsightedness?”\n\nYes, and the onset of cataract\nAt the moment it’s in the early experimental phase\nThis compound must be applied in a topical fashion\nSo putting in an eyedrop and that drop has to run the gauntlet of going through the cornea, which has lipid layers and water-soluble layers\nIt’s got to get through all that into the aqueous humor in the front and then through the lens capsule into the lens to actually do its work\nThat’s why this particular drug or compound is a choline ester, because that allows it to get through that lipid layer in the front, through the water-soluble portion of the cornea, and then hopefully into the lens itself\nThis is not easy to do; the lens is a relatively privileged area, both from an immunological, but also a pharmacological standpoint\n\n\n\nAnatomy of the eye from back to front\n\nEveryone recognizes the pupil as the dark part\n\nThe pupil changes size to dilate and constrict, or is this just the iris moving (the colored part of the eye)?\n\n\nYes, the physical aperture of the pupil changes in size; it gets bigger; it gets smaller\n\nWhen someone goes to the eye doctor, and their pupils are dilated, the pupil is physically opened up pharmacologically, and that’s mostly so the doctor can see into the back of the eye to see what’s going on\nIn effect, this forces the iris to move out of the way\n\n\nThe iris almost looks like the aperture of a camera; one can either constrict it or make it bigger\n\n \nEye drops that can potentially improve vision [27:30]\n\nInterestingly, one of the big pharmacological frontiers in development are drugs that intentionally shrink the aperture (of the pupils) in the pursuit of increased depth of focus\nStudents of photography will know that the smaller the aperture, the smaller the hole, the more stuff is in focus at the same time\nIf one can make the pupil small pharmacologically and get it into the sweet spot (which is probably about 1.6 millimeter) one can suddenly see up close again\n\nThis expands the depth of focus\n\n\nPeter clarifies, so another way to manipulate the ability to see things up close is to force the aperture of the lens to be in a position that isn’t necessarily dictated by the availability of light?\n\nThis relates to the movement of the lens in and out along the Z-axis\nAlso putting aside any other problems that can occur with the lens\n\n\nSteven explains, “That’s exactly right. Imagine it’s squinting.” \n\nWhen one squints, they’re reducing the aperture through with they are looking and filtering out optically",

You’re letting less light in, but the only light you’re letting in are those rays that happen to be parallel in perfect focus, and you can actually see.” – Steven Dell\n\nIn an ongoing clinical trial that he performed to look at this, those competing forces were examined very closely, and they found that the aperture effect, the depth of focus outweighed any loss of vision from loss of light\n\nData not yet published \n\n\nHow long would the effect of these eye drops last?\nThis actually depends a little on eye color\n\nLight eyes tend to react more to any given strength of dilating drop (or constricting)\n\n\nIt would last about 6-8 hours, maybe up to 10 hours\n\nSo this would be a once-a-day, maybe a twice-a-day eye drop\n\n\nPeter wonders if this would compromise far vision\nNo, and what was really interesting is when Steven looked at patients who had their pupil size reduced pharmacologically, their distance vision also improved by the same principle because their depth of focus was so good\n\nIn the same way that one can squint and make out a highway sign if someone is a little bit nearsighted or a little bit farsighted, or has an astigmatism\n\n\nSquinting improves vision and pharmacological manipulation of the pupil will do this as well\n\nHe thinks commercials for these drugs will begin to be aired early in 2022\n\n\nPeter notes, the complicated aspect of these eye drops is the drug has to make its way into the lens\n\nHe sees now why that would be more about the cataract issue and not about the presbyopia issue; this would be a much easier way to solve presbyopia because the drug only has to get onto the iris\n\n\nSteven explains that this is a drug that shrinks the pupil and works in 15 minutes\nVersus something that softens the lens that might work in 15 months\nThose  are very different markets\nLipoic acid choline ester is being pursued as a presbyopia near vision aid or something to reduce the effects of\n\nOne real goal is to reduce the incidence or delay the onset of cataract formation, which would be really cool\nStudy published in Eye in 2021,  Topical lipoic acid choline ester eye drop for improvement of near visual acuity in subjects with presbyopia: a safety and preliminary efficacy trial \n\n\n\n \nThe explanation for different eye colors [33:15]\nDarker eye color provides greater protection from UV light\n\nIs there any clear evolutionary explanation for why different eye colors have emerged? What’s the advantage of brown iris versus blue?\nThe advantage of a brown iris is the protection it offers from UV light, and visible light\n\nThis works in the same way as darker skin tones\nSo typically, it is common to see dark-eyed people clustered closer to the equator because the visible light and UV light and infrared light or infrared radiation are really destructive\n\n\nOne of the few things that people remember from medical school about the retina is it’s one of the most metabolically active tissues in the body\nAnd because it’s constantly being bombarded with radiation, effectively, it’s prone to free radical formation\n",

    "content": "\nSo what’s called the retinal pigment epithelium, which is the pigmented layer behind the retina, underneath the retina, that is responsible for shielding the vascular supply behind the retina from all of this radiation \nThis is important because the vascular network behind the retina has a very high oxygen tension, and it would be prone to free radical formation if it were constantly being bombarded by UV light, infrared radiation, visible light\nThat’s why one sees in people with more pigment  near the equator; and that’s also true of the iris as well\n\n\n\n \nPhysiology of the eye and its connections to the brain [34:45]\nThe role of rods and cones in vision \n\nCones are primarily for daytime vision and they’re clustered in the center of ones visual sphere\n\nSo near the center of the macula, which is the central portion of the retina, and the very center of the macula, is the fovea; this is where the cones are\n\n\nThe rods are in the periphery and they typically are responsible more for dim illumination vision like night vision\n\nAnd they’re very good at picking up motion\nSo as predators, we want to make sure that we can hone in on where prey is, but as prey ourselves, we want to be able to detect, danger something moving in the periphery\n\n\nEach rod cell and each cone cell provides one signal\n\nThey are highly specialized calls\nThey are referred to as photoreceptors and they have stacks of structures within them that are photosensitive; and that causes a depolarization\nPeter asks if they work like channel opsins; do they use a photon to create an action potential?\n\nYes, once a photon hits a particular cell photoreceptor, there’s a change in the membrane and ions flow; and that’s how a signal is generated\nAnd this ion flow ultimately makes its way to the optic nerve and then to the brain\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual processing in the brain\n\nMost of the visual processing is in the very back of the brain\nAnd about half of the overall brain structure deals with vision in some capacity\n\nThat’s why, for example, when people have a stroke, there’s almost always some component of visual involvement in a stroke\nSomeone may have a droopy face on one side and then a limb is droopy as well\nBut if one maps out the visual sphere, they will detect some deficit in the visual sphere for most strokes\n\n\nPeter puts this in context of brain structure— \n\nThe brainstem is the most primitive piece of the brain; it is basically responsible for autonomic function\nNext is midbrain that sits on top of it \n\nIt is sort of a reptilian brain, a lot of emotion there\n\n\nThen, what in theory distinguishes humans from all the other animals is this remarkable cortical piece that sits on top of it\n\nHow much of the visual processing is in that neocortex? Is it virtually all done there? —Yes\n\n\nPupil responses are controlled by the midbrain, autonomic stuff\nVisual processing and the actual mapping of the visual sphere has been mapped to the cortex\nParts of the brain that are specific to edge detection or moving edge detection has been mapped quite elegantly to the cortex\n\n\nPeter asks, “Is there a cross? Is the left doing the right and vice versa?” \n\nYes, that’s right\nRemember, information is sent from your left visual sphere to the right side of the brain\nBut information is coming from both eyes\n\n\nThe simplest way to think about something is that at the pituitary, there is something called the optic chiasm\n\nThis is where the optic nerve crosses; about half the fibers cross\nSo if a visual deficit is in one eye only, this shows that it is in front of the chiasm\nAnd if it’s behind the chiasm, it should affect both eyes, maybe asymmetrically, but it should affect both eyes\nThis can be very helpful in localizing where a particular problem is\nNow, a lot of that’s done through imaging, but there used to be quite an art to this clinical exam\n\n\nPeter remembers both in neurology and probably neuroanatomy, kind of going into these really crazy tests where he’d see the patient performing the tests and missing a certain thing\n\nIt looked like they must be faking it; like there’s no way to produce such a bizarre deficit in this one part of this one visual field\nBut then, if there was a tumor, it would totally explain this once one understands how the nerves cross\n\n",

There’s no moon. You can see that”\n\nBut in that same desert at high noon, where there may be 200,000 lux illumination, human eye site is still good\nHumans can see so many, many orders of magnitude of change of illuminations\nIt’s astonishing that our eyes can function in both of those environments\n\n\nPeter notes humans have a short-lived advantage over some animals when it gets darker\n\nThere’s a very narrow window at dusk and dawn, where humans have better vision\nMaybe humans evolved to have good vision in a slightly greater range of light\nHe’s always been amazed at why we did not develop a better sense of smell\n\nHumans effectively can’t smell compared to animals; it’s absurd how different it is\nThis is true for our hearing as well; ours is nothing compared to them\n\n\n\n\nSteven notes about vision, “It’s the one sense that if you asked people which sense they’d be most willing to give up…this is the last one” \n\nIt’s very common for patients to grab his arm as they are going into surgery and say,  “Dr. Dell, you don’t understand.

I mean, they just know, you’re wearing your safety goggles if you do that stuff, because I’m totally paranoid they’re going to have one of these tragic accidents.”\nSteven agrees, this is a good PSA; he sees a lot of eye injuries\n\n“I think injuries are one of the main causes of devastating visual loss in young people” – Steven Dell\n\nIn general, almost all of the big causes and movers of visual loss are senescence-related or age-related\n\nBut in young people, it’s trauma\n\n\nBlunt trauma is the most common eye injury he sees\nThe eye is pretty well protected with the brow and the cheek, but there are certain things that can get in there and can directly impact the eye\nIn a young person, trauma is something one has to watch out for\nPeter asks, “What is the velocity at which we can’t out blink it?” \n",

If one of them flies up and hits your eye,” and he goes, “I would see it. And I would close my eyes.” And I’m like, “No you wouldn’t, buddy.”” \nSteven agrees, you wouldn’t blink in time to keep objects like this out\nPeter notes that some objects move slower; “If somebody’s throwing you a ball and you misjudge it, you’re going to blink. That’s slow enough that you can catch it.”\nSteven agrees but points out there are other objects that move faster\nHe’s operated on a number of major league baseball players and for them seeing the laces on the ball as hitters is enormous; it’s their career\n\nIt’s the difference between them hitting well or average\nAnd some of these players that he’s operated on have been 20/20 before they had surgery, but they wanted to be 20/15 or 20/10\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEnhancing vision beyond 20/20 [47:00]\nWhat is 20/20 vision and can this be enhanced?\n\n20/20 simply means that one can see at 20 feet what a “normal” person can see at 20 feet\nIf one’s vision is 20/10, they can see at 20 feet what a normal person has to get 10 feet up to in order to see\n\nSo 20/10 is better than 20/20\n\n\nSo some of these major league baseball players want to be 20/10 or 20/15\n\nHe’s been able to achieve that with modern forms of laser vision correction\n\n\nSteven had a discussion yesterday with a guy who owns a soccer team and he said, “Have you ever had your players tested for their vision?” \n\nThe guy sort of froze and turned white for a second; and he just said, “It’s so crazy you say that because we put them through this barrage of tests physically to see what their heart, their lungs, their kidneys, all that stuff, we didn’t check their vision.” \n\n\nThere are ways to boost human performance beyond 20/20\nThe theoretical limit of how well one can see is defined by essentially the pixelation of their retina\n\nThis is the spacing of the cells of those photoreceptors discussed earlier\nThis varies from person to person, but it’s somewhere in the vicinity of about 20/08 or so\nWith a sharp enough image, one could theoretically see better than 20/10\nAnd the only way one can really achieve that is to remove some of the optical irregularities that everyone is born with and somehow neutralize them along with the glasses prescription\n\nCurrently, this can be achieved laser vision correction\n\n\n\n\n\nLaser vision correction compared to contact lenses\n\nPeter asks, “Why would it be beneficial to an athlete who, for understandable reasons, needs the best vision possible to undergo laser corrective surgery versus just using contact lenses to accomplish the same thing? Is that possible?”\nLet’s first consider contact lenses; anyone who’s ever worn contact lenses knows that when they put in a brand new pair, they can see pretty well with them\n\nBut then the eye begins to regard that contact lens as a foreign object\nSo one’s body just begins to attack it, coat it with all sorts of immunological debris\nOne is susceptible to pollen, dust, whatever it is that coats this formerly pristine object\nAnd let’s say there is correction for astigmatism in that contact lens, where its orientation is important\nEvery time one blinks, that contact lens moves a little bit\nAll of those factors contribute to optical performance that is less than what could be achieved with spectacles or laser vision correction\nIn particular, soft contact lenses do a very, very good job, but they typically don’t provide superhuman vision performance\n\n\nPeter recalls, “It’s funny, I experimented two years ago with a stronger prescription than normal to get me to 20/15 in my dominant eye for archery.” \nSteven comments this must have goofed-up his near vision\n\nYea, that was the problem",

Anatomy of the eye, the cornea.  Image credit: Britannica\n\nThere can be astigmatism in the lens itself, the lens behind the pupil\nPeter has a corneal astigmatism; that’s the normal one\n\nThis simply means the eye is not perfectly shaped; it’s a bit oblong like an egg or football\nSteven compares it to an American football, “So if you are walking along the laces of the football, you would encounter a fairly gradual curve. But if you took a right turn and walked it perpendicular, it would be very steep.” \nThat means that the power differs by meridian; so Peter needs a different glasses prescription in this meridian versus this meridian\n\n\nThe prevalence of astigmatism is pretty high\n\nAround 60% of patients with a glasses prescription have some significant degree of astigmatism\n\n\n\nEvolution of vision problems\n\nPeter wonders why poor vision has been allowed to evolve, “Vision that would impair your ability to survive through reproductive age probably didn’t evolve” \n\nMaybe there was a day when the genetic variability of eyes was broad enough that a subset of people had really poor vision; the type of people who maybe aren’t around today?\nSteven agrees, “This is a super interesting topic and it shows you how plastic the evolutionary or actually the adaptive component of the eyeball is itself.”\nThe length of the eye is really what determines whether one is nearsighted or farsighted\n\nThis is the distance from front to back, anterior-posterior length of the eyeball\nPrimarily, that is the main driver as to whether one is nearsighted or farsighted\n\n\nThose who are in the know and are watching this or listening to it also realize that sometimes it’s the curvature of the cornea that contributes to whether someone is nearsighted or farsighted\n\n\n\n \n Nearsightedness (myopia): causes, epidemic in children, and prevention strategies [54:15]\n\nBut let’s say for the purposes of this discussion that it’s the length of the eyeball that is the main reason why someone is nearsighted or not or farsighted. \n\nSo a very nearsighted person has a very long eyeball\n\n\nPeter wants clarification, with a very long anterior-posterior axis, one is going to have a hard time seeing things far away\n\nIs that because the further away something is, the harder it is to focus all the light coming in?\n\n\nSteven explains, when most of one’s visual environment is close, then the light rays from that close object are diverging\n\nSo these light rays are falling behind the retina of someone who’s perfectly targeted for distance\nThe eyeball is really smart and it says, “Okay, so you’re telling me everything is here, close up. I know, I’ll just grow longer so that these near objects are in perfect focus.” And that is exactly what happens\nThis can happen over a period of months\n\nIf a young person exclusively performs near tasks, their eye will grow longer so that those near objects are in perfect focus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter comments “So if you could do an awful experiment…”\n\nSteven says, “It’s been done” \nThis is what is happening in our current society;  children looking at screens, near objects, for hours on end and not going outside often develop nearsightedness \n\n\nThere are two drivers of nearsightedness in the plastic developing human\n\n1) Deprivation from outdoor light \n2) Near work\n\n\nMany of studies of children have been done in Asia, where there is an epidemic right now of myopia of astonishing proportions\n\nAbout 90% of the population is now nearsighted in certain southeastern nation cities\nWhen that becomes such a dominant phenotype, something is really oddly off\n\n\nPeter notes, “this really transcends evolution because if you can change something in years or months”",

It’s adaptive within the eyeball itself.”\nGroups of 7- to 11-year-old children have been studies\n\nSend half of them outside for 80 minutes during the school day for recess\nKeep half of them indoors for recess\nThe risk of or the incidence of nearsightedness is half in the group that went outside \n\nSo the risk of nearsightedness can be cut in half by going outside\nWithout any instruction to go and look at things far away, but just by the very fact that outside there’s so much more to see and ones is going to be looking further out\n\n\n\n\nThis has been further studied in terms of is it just being outside or is it the light? \n\nIt’s actually both\nBut the light is really the most important driver of protection from nearsightedness\nSo if one is outside on a bright sunny day, they’re releasing a fair bit of dopamine from the retina and dopamine inhibits the growth of the eye\nSo the worst thing to do is stay inside in a dimly lit room and perform near tasks\n\nThat raises the risk of nearsightedness 16 fold compared to kids who go outside\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks if epidemiological studies show that the further one is from the equator the greater the risk of nearsightedness, simply based on the light part of this argument?\nYes; there is some data that shows that\n\nAnd not only that, they’ve taken children and given them equal intervals of outdoor activity, but the ones who had noontime outdoor activity did better than the ones who were outdoors at 8:00 AM, when there was less illumination\nFurther, it is known from animal models that it is illumination that is critical in this dopamine release\nSo does that mean more skylights in classrooms or more windows or more natural light would be beneficial?\n\nCould artificial light mimic some of the sunlight by making these rooms brighter and prevent some of this myopia epidemic?\n\n\n\n\nPeter reasons, “Is a photon, a photon, a photon?” How does this work\nIt is not known whether that’s the case because there’s a whole spectrum of light\nSo is the blue light more important? This is tangential\n\nOne hears all this negativity about blue light\nBlue light is critical for wakefulness, for attention, and Steven thinks for preventing myopia\n\n\n\nOther risks associated with nearsightedness\n\nBy the way, myopia (or nearsightedness) is not just the inconvenience of wearing glasses or contact lenses or having laser vision correction when one is 23 years old\nThere are pathologies that are much more common in very nearsighted patients compared to the general population\n\nIt’s much more common to see cataract formation in myopic patients\nThey get something called myopic macular degeneration\nThey’re at risk for glaucoma\nThey’re at risk for tears and detachments of the retina\nThese are disease-associated conditions\n\n\n\nConsidering vision from an evolutionary perspective—Is there genetic susceptibility to vision loss?\n\nPeter returns to his evolutionary question, “it’s quite possible that over hundreds of millions of years, any deficit in vision that would’ve prevented you from reproducing or impaired your ability to escape a predator would’ve taken that out. So from a genetic standpoint, our vision should be very good.” \nSteven clarifies that vision is very good in non-literate societies\n\nIn hunter-gatherer tribes, there is no nearsightedness; it just doesn’t happen\n\n\nPeter finds this amazing and asks, “This suggests that because my parents wore glasses, I should wear glasses, is not true. Or is there an epigenetic part of this?” \nBoth are true; there is a genetic component\n\nFor siblings of individuals who wear spectacles, there is a higher incidence of myopia or hyperopia\n\nThis could be susceptibility\nIt is not known whether parents of reading children were reading children themselves; so it’s hard to separate out the genetic component; there does seem to be a genetic component as well\nBut the environmental component seems to be way stronger and more powerful\n\nTake parents who don’t wear spectacles and put their child in a dark room and give them an electronic device or a book or whatever it is and have that child focus at near for hours on end, odds are they’re much more at risk for developing nearsightedness\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter thinks about his kids; his wife has perfect vision and his diopter is -3 and -4\n",

How do we apply them?” \nIt depends on the type of dry eye \n\nOne thinks of tears as just saltwater, but that’s really not what it is\n\nIt’s really an emulsion of lipids and mucin and all sorts of immune modulators and antibodies and all sorts of things in this soup\nSome of it is just what is referred to as the aqueous component of tears, really just the saltwater\n\n\nBut the sebaceous glands that are in the eyelids are called meibomian glands (where the lashes come out of the skin), the secretions of those meibomian glands can become dysfunctional\n\nAnd that means that the tears have a hard time gliding over the surface of the cornea; and that can lead to dry eye\nSo all sorts of things that cause meibomian gland dysfunction\n\nSome of that relates to diet; some people believe that a diet high in saturated fats is more likely to cause meibomian gland dysfunction\nCertainly colder weather affects these glands, just like the sebaceous glands in the skin, they respond better to sunlight, to heat\nIn a cold environment the meibomian glands can become plugged up and bacteria can build up along the eyelid margin causing inflammation\nAnd when there’s inflammation, the lacrimal gland shuts down even more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEye drops \n\nPeter notes, “when I think about eyedrops, I think about sort of the dropper that you try to get in your eye, and you can never get it, at least I can never get it in my eye because I end up blinking all the time. So then you try and drop it into the corner” \nBut he’s also seen the mist applicators\nWhat are the different ways eyedrops can be applied?\nEye drops work pretty well for most people; most artificial tears come in the form of an eye drop\nThere are some mist sprays, believe it or not, one is a hypochlorous acid compound that is sprayed on the lids; and it sort of migrates into the eye \n\nThis actually is very good for reducing the bacterial counts at the lid margin, which is part of that inflammation cycle that is so critical in dry eye\n\n\nThe eye drops do need to get on the eyeball \nEye drops are just one of just a whole bunch of strategies used for treating dry eye\n\nThere’s a very significant benefit from supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids, especially high doses of omega-3 fatty acids and certain types of omega-6 fatty acids such as:\n\nGLA (gamma-linolenic acid); that’s what you’d find in black current seed oil, borage oil, or evening primrose oil\n\n\nThere was a very large randomized clinical trial looking at omega-3 supplementation in pretty high doses, 3 grams of EPA and DHA\n",

It’s just a question of how much.” \n\n\nA lot of patients fear that they’ll do something to goof up the surgery and there are a number of reasons why that really can’t happen\n\nDetails of the PRK procedure\n\nLong before this patient ever laid down on this gurney to have this laser treatment done, their eye was digitally mapped using what is referred to as a wavefront sensing device\n\nSo think about this, a very narrow beam of light is sent in with a laser and how it bounces back from the cornea is determined\nIt bounces back in a distorted fashion\nAn ideal ray of light in, or multiple rays of light are sent in, and they bounce back in a distorted fashion\nThe amount of that distortion allows a map to be created\nIt’s much more than a topographical map\nIt’s the entire optical pathway of the eye from the retina to the back, all the way to the back and front\nThe entire distortion pathway is visualized\n\nThere’s more than one way to do this:\n1) There is a topography-based way to do this as well, which is very effective\n2) The one he’s describing is sort of the easiest one to think of\n\nA known uniform beam of light is sent in and he looks at how it bounces back from the back of the eye\nThat reveals what are the distortions present in this eye; how much nearsightedness, farsightedness…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagnostically, this is part of the workup for laser vision correction\n\nThey look at how a particular eyeball distorts light as it goes through the optical pathway\nThis technology was developed for telescopes that have to contend with atmospheric distortion, like the Keck\n\nThey send up a diagnostic laser into the atmosphere and the distortion that that laser is encountering is adjusted for in real time with a deformable mirror, a very thin mirror, and that allows them to essentially correct for the distortions of the atmosphere in real time\nAnd those are constantly changing\n\n\nIn the eye they have the benefit of not having to deal with real time, evolving distortion, but he can take a snapshot of what the distortions are in the eyeball\n\nPart of that involves the ability to track the eye\nThey have to lock onto, and register the eye with the equipment\nThe laser can track any movement one makes far more rapidly than it is possible to move the eye\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter if the patient’s eyes are moving during this diagnostic because the laser is moving\nHe does coach them to, “Hey, look at the flashing light” but that’s really just to keep them in the ballpark of where the tracker can lock onto them\n\n\nThe fear of the patient, “I’m going to mess it up.” is not a ridiculous fear; it’s universal\nSteven tells patients, “Hey, I’m not going to let you do anything to mess this up” \nThe laser will not fire unless the patient is within its range of tracking, and the laser will move faster than the patient can move\nSo PRK is changing the shape of the eye by vaporizing the tissue\n\nIt’s a laser that’s scanning around the cornea where it does a little treatment here and there\nThermally one doesn’t want to do another shot right next to the previous one, so it moves over to another area to let the tissue cool down for a few milliseconds\n\nSo the laser dances around\n\n\n\n\nThis takes anywhere from 15 seconds to 2 minutes\n\nThe worse the prescription is, the longer it takes\nSo a -10 would take a minute or so\nIt depends on the laser and the overall treatment size\n\n\nThis fixes the astigmatism and all the little distortions\nHe measures all the little optical distortions, the coma and trefoil (terms optical physicists are very familiar with), and does his best to eliminate them with laser vision correction\nFor PRK this takes 2-3 minutes, plus the Valium time\n\nThe patient takes Valium a half an hour before; it works pretty quickly when they chew it\n\n\nComparing PRK and LASIK— 30 days after the procedure, the results are indistinguishable\n\nBut the LASIK patients get there way quicker\n\n\n\nPRK recovery\n\nWith PRK the epithelium is removed so now there is a 7-8 mm diameter area of the central cornea that has no epithelium\n\nIt has to grow back",

What’s the point?” \nSteven realized what he should have said was it has no symptoms until the very end\n\n\nThe peripheral vision is damaged at the end of glaucoma\nMost people will not detect a slight reduction in their peripheral vision, particularly if it’s segmental\n\nThere will be just a little area off to the side that they can’t see\nThis is particularly true if the other eye is covering for that area\n\n\nBut as glaucoma progresses, it can affect central vision, and then it becomes symptomatic\nLuckily glaucoma has become much more treatable\n\nThe pharmacological management of glaucoma has gotten way better\nAnd there are numerous laser procedures that can treat glaucoma, what are referred to as minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) \n\n\n\nCause of glaucoma\n\nPeter asks “what’s the 80/20 of this? 80% of them are caused by what” \nSo 80% of them are caused by what is referred to as garden variety chronic open angle glaucoma\n\nThis means that the glaucoma is not a function of the anatomy of the front of the eye being too crowded, where the fluid can’t get out\nIt’s more a problem of overproduction of fluid inside the eye, and the pressure is too high inside the eye\n\nThis is the aqueous fluid not vitreous fluid\n\n\nIt is not know what causes this; the pathogenesis is likely multifactorial\nIt runs in families, so there is a family history component but it’s not simple heredity\nIt is not coupled with diabetes\nThere’s some relationship to hypertension, blood pressure; but it can be seen in patients who are not hypertensive at all\nIt’s very common\n\n\n",

If you want to figure out a way to live to a hundred…”\n\nThink about how to delay the onset of atherosclerosis\nAnd an aggressive strategy to mitigate cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, etc.   \nBut these other things don’t get enough attention:  teeth, ears, and eyes\n\n\n\n“I mean, you don’t want to get to be a hundred and have no teeth.  And you don’t want to get to be a hundred and be deaf. And you don’t want to get to be a hundred and be blind.” – Peter Attia\n\nSteven notes, “Trying to get a kid to wear sunglasses is tough” \nHats are important as well, that’s a very good and effective way to protect the eyes\n\nBut it’s not enough because a certain amount of light bounces off and hits the bottom of one’s cheek and goes right into the eye\n\n\n\nSupplements\n\nNutritional supplements might have some effect\nVitamin C deficiency is associated with an elevated risk of cataract\n\nBut it’s been shown conclusively that vitamin C supplementation to super normal levels does not protect against cataract formation\n\n\nOther antioxidants that have been looked at (vitamins A, C, and E) basically have no effect on cataract formation\n\nThere is a little bit of mixed weak evidence for lutein and zeaxanthin as possibly being protective for cataract and macular degeneration\n\n\nIn the drugstore they sell AREDS formula for macular degeneration; that stands for Age-Related Eye Disease Study\nThe Age-Related Eye Disease Study was a National Eye Institute initiative\n\nFirst they looked at C, E and beta-carotene with zinc and a little copper\nThey put the copper in because they were worried about copper deficiency with zinc supplementation\nThen they got concerned about beta-carotene, so they did another study where they took beta-carotene out and put in lutin and zeaxanthine, powerful antioxidants\nThey showed this supplementation could delay or reduce the conversion of mild macular degeneration to severe disease; but it had not effect on severe disease \nInterestingly, it had no effect on people who didn’t have macular degeneration; it didn’t prevent them from going on to get it\nMost ophthalmologists believe there’s something there, there’s some signal embedded in that noise\n\n\nLight is also a big risk for macular degeneration\n",

Maybe neither are ideal, but one seems demonstrably worse, at least for me” \n\n\nSteven has software embedded in all of his PCs that changes the color temperatures\n\nf.lux is a software that’s free; it will take the blue light sequentially out of the monitor as the day goes on, as the evening goes on to the point that it’s like super amber, as it gets close to bedtime \n\nHe really thinks that’s great\n\n\n\n\n\n \nContact lenses: good hygiene and considerations [2:27:45]\nPeter asks what else people should think about to protect their eyes\n\nHe notes, the big takeaways for him have been the importance of sunglasses, artificial tears, taking one’s contact lenses out as frequently as possible, right? \n\nDon’t sleep in contact lenses and stuff like that\nThe daily ones seem best if one can afford it\nIt makes more sense than the 2-week ones that have to be washed every night\nSteven thinks the most important thing is to just get them out of the eye\nHe doesn’t like extended-wear contact lenses\n\n\nAs an eye surgeon, he tends to see a selected sample of patients who are the problems\n\nThe people who have sight-threatening infections from sleeping typically in contact lenses\nYes, he realizes there are millions of people who sleep in their contacts and don’t get infections, but the people who end up in his office have had problems; and some of them quite devastating problems\nHe’s  not a big fan of sleeping in contact lenses in general, but if one is going to sleep in them, he’d rather they be a perfect, pristine, new pair every single time\n\nAnd get them out as quickly as you possibly can\n\n\n\n\n\n \nA bonus benefit from repairing cataracts [2:29:00]\n\nPeter notes, “The other takeaway for me, is not to be so afraid of cataracts. They’re inevitable. And…  there’s a potential silver lining, which is not only the improvement of your vision, but potentially the correction of other age-related visual changes.” \nSteven agrees, it’s interesting that once word got out in the community that this was something that could be done, he saw people coming in asking for cataract surgery a little sooner than they otherwise would\n\nBecause they know that this added benefit is a potential possibility",

Are they leaking fluid?\nThis is a very early sign of diabetic retinopathy\n\n\nThe lens could be imaged to determine if glucose is leaching into this lens? \n\nDoes it contain more glucose than one would expect a normal individual to have in their lens? \nMight that be a screening technique for diabetic disease… probably yes\n\n\nAnd what about the fact that diabetes manifests primarily as a microvascular disease in so many end organs and in the eye, one can actually directly visualize this microvascular disease occurring\n\nIf it’s in the eye, it’s probably in the kidney, it’s probably in the toes\n\n\n\n\nPeter notes this diagnosis is not binary; this is a spectrum\n\nWhen the hemoglobin A1C is 6.5%, the person has type II diabetes\n\nBut at 6% they’re prediabetic\nAnd at 5.6%, we say they’re normal\n\n\n\n\n",
