No one, including Dave, is disputing that the phenotype of interest has more LDL-C and more LDL-P. There are only 3 ways this can happen (these are [collectively exhaustive, but not [mutually exclusive]): make more, clear less, transfer from other pools that we can’t see (e.g., cell membranes). I think the data make the first of these by far the most likely driver, but Dave seemed unable to address this and could not explain, to me at least, what could account for this increase in LDL-P/C. So on first principles, my doubt of this model has gone up from the start of this discussion, as the person who developed the model could not actually explain the mass balance. This is one of the most fundamental requirements of any model. And to be clear, even if this fundamental condition were met, it would not be sufficient to make the case that [lean mass hyper-responders or LMHRs] are not at risk. It’s a [necessary but not sufficient] criteria that, in my mind, has failed.”\n“Dave argues that VLDL production is driving the LDL concentration, but the fact remains that in insulin-sensitive people (which presumably the LMHRs are), the opposite is true: there are fewer, not more, TG being exported from the liver and there is less, not more, apoC-III on the VLDL, thereby reducing, not increasing, their residence time. In other words, LMHR would have less VLDL to LDL conversion than, say, someone with T2D. So again, I can see no evidence whatsoever that his energy model, which can’t be explained on mass balance, and can’t be explained on what is known about the physiology of VLDL and LDL, is plausible.”\n“Even if you ignore the points above—which you can’t—I am more unconvinced than ever at the notion that we should exclude the roughly 2,000 genetic mutations known to produce a phenotype of high LDL-C, high HDL-C, and low TG. We have 2,000 natural experiments. Surely at least some of these cases (e.g., PCSK9 gain of function) are excellent proxies for the key features of LMHR. Yet to ignore them for imaginary reasons (e.g., having gain of function PCSK9 is somehow toxic to endothelial cells because it impairs their ability to take up cholesterol despite there being no evidence that endothelial cells require PCSK9 to uptake LDL in a receptor-mediated fashion) is to say, in my opinion, one does not want to know the answer to this question.”\n\nPeter emphasizes that probabilities play a very important role in diseases like atherosclerosis, and this nuance is often missing when discussing this disease.\nAtherosclerosis is impacted by many things beyond the lipoproteins, but that doesn’t diminish their role in the causality of atherosclerosis, Peter argues.",

    "content": "\nNote from Peter: Some low carb enthusiasts argue that as long as they are insulin sensitive, have high HDL-C and low TG, their LDL-C (or LDL-P or apoB) is irrelevant. Further, many confuse imaging tests like calcium scans (CACs) as biomarkers and argue that as long as CAC = 0, there is no need to treat, despite the risk predicted by biomarkers. If you are confused by all of the noise on this topic, consider this example: A biomarker like LDL-P or apoB is predictive. It’s like saying you live in a neighborhood with a lot of break-ins. A CAC is a backward-looking assessment of damage that has already taken place. So it’s more like an investigation into a break-in that already happened. In my opinion, waiting until there is grossly visible (i.e., no longer just microscopic) evidence of disease in the artery to decide to treat for risk already predicted by biomarkers is like saying you won’t get a lock on your door—even if you live in a high-risk neighborhood—until you’ve suffered a break-in. This is bad risk management. As the saying goes, “When did Noah build the ark?”\nUltimately, it’s up to the individual, who’s LDL-P and LDL-C are very high while consuming a low-carb high-fat (LCHF) or ketogenic diet (KD), to make a decision: the hope is that the following discussion (and related references and material in the show notes) can help people think through the issues and make a more informed decision.\nDave’s lipid energy model\n\nFigure 1.

Probably not: Peter has seen this patient’s previous labs on a ketogenic diet and the LDL-C was 125 mg/dL\nHis cholesterol synthesis (desmosterol) is through the roof, and his cholesterol absorption (campesterol, sitosterol, cholestanol) is quite high as well\n\n\n\n\nPeter thinks the explanation for this phenotype is the up-regulation cholesterol synthesis from the saturated fat: a sterol regulated binding protein issue, or some sort of regulatory path around what the body is doing with ketones and/or saturated fat\nPeter used to see patients all the time with diabetic ketoacidosis in the ER, usually patients with type 1 diabetes, usually, it’s precipitated by some acute illness\nTheir glucose level becomes very high, they don’t have enough insulin, they have electrolyte abnormalities, and they present with very high levels of ketones: it’s life threatening\nIt turns out a lot of these people have very elevated levels of LDL-C, TC, and TG\nOnce you correct this metabolic deficit, the cholesterol returns to normal\nDave believes it may be related to what he calls the lean mass hyper-responder phenotype\nDave did a resistance training experiment to see if there was an effect on lipoproteins\nDave thinks there’s a greater overall gradient of receptor mediated endocytosis for muscle repair and growth with resistance training\nIf the hypothesis is true, Dave would expect that his LDL-C and LDL-P might change: more use of the product of LDL-P directly by the cells\nPeter believes this patient is at risk based on his lipoproteins results, because this is one of the three legs of the stool: the burden of lipoprotein, the endothelial function or health, and the inflammatory response to it\n\n \nHypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia that gets corrected after treating diabetic ketoacidosis: Severe Hypertriglyceridemia in Diabetic Ketoacidosis Accompanied by Acute Pancreatitis: Case Report (Hahn et al., 2010) [1:35:30]\nHypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia that gets corrected after treating diabetic ketoacidosis: Severe hypertriglyceridemia in diabetic ketosis (Fulop and Eder, 1990) [1:35:30]\nHypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia that gets corrected after treating diabetic ketoacidosis: Plasma triglycerides and cholesterol in diabetic ketosis (Fulop and Eder, 1989) [1:35:30]\nDave’s self-experiment with exercise and lipoprotein response: Resistance Training Experiment – Findings – Part I | Dave Feldman (cholesterolcode.com) [1:38:00]\nPeter’s three-day exercise and ketosis experiment [1:41:00]\n\nPeter did an experiment where he did extensive blood tests, three tests a day, for three days, doing different types of exercise\nThe tests are not commercially available: Peter tested pre-workout, immediately post-workout, and four hours later, looking at LDL, VLDL, and HDL particles, both in terms of their cholesterol and triglyceride content\nThere’s virtually no way to distinguish what’s going on at the VLDL level\nPeter believes the labs show that the VLDL is moving its triglyceride, and the LDL, and the cholesterol is barely moving\nYou cannot infer the actual numbers that went in and out, but just the net change",

[1:45:00]\n\nThere are different definitions of “remnants”\nThe poor-man’s version of remnant cholesterol is TG/5, which is the estimated VLDL-C\nThis is actually part of the Friedewald equation and how LDL-C is calculated on most standard panels:\n\nCalculated LDL-C = TC – HDL-C – estimated VLDL-C (TG/5)\n\n\nIf you have an LDL-direct lab test, you can estimate VLDL-C:\n\nVLDL-C = TC – HDL-C – LDL-C\n\n\nPeter says that it’s impossible to truly know someone’s remnants: Peter looks at remnants as VLDLs that have shed their triglyceride and are now small and cholesterol-rich\nIn Peter’s 3-day exercise experiment, his VLDL-C measured direct is 4 mg/dL, whereas his lipid panel (TC: 165, LDL-C: 88, HDL-C: 49, TG: 126) calculates his VLDL-C at 25 mg/dl using Friedewald (TG/5), and 28 mg/dL using TC – HDL-C – LDL-C, a difference of 525% and 600%, respectively [1:47:30]\nWhen Dave speaks of remnant cholesterol, he’s referring to all cholesterol that’s not in either an LDL particle or in an HDL particle: subtract HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (i.e., the VLDL-C estimates above)\nSome IDL, and possibly chylomicrons remnants can also remain in the bloodstream under certain conditions\nThe issue Peter has with looking at VLDL-C is it doesn’t reveal what those particles have done or where they’re going\nPeter also found in one of his experiments that his estimated VLDL-C (TG/5 and LDL-C direct method) was five and six times higher than his direct VLDL-C measurement, respectively\nDave believes the phenotype of lean mass hyper-responders will have very low levels of VLDL cholesterol, have very high levels of LDL cholesterol, and will have very low levels of remnant lipoproteins\nUnfortunately, remnant lipoproteins can’t be accurately measured in a commercial test\nPeter shows a study where they measured the number of particles in VLDL, IDL, LDL, and HDL (Table 1)\nThe more insulin resistant you get, the more your total burden of apoB goes up: what the table is showing, is where is that burden coming from\nThe VLDL increased by 20 nanomoles per liter, and the LDL-P increased by 400 nanomoles per liter\nThe VLDL is going up as you get more insulin resistant, but it does not appear very clinically relevant, Peter says, because the burden of disease is from the apoB bearing particles, and so the increase in VLDL particle number is not what’s driving the risk of the disease\nDave wonders if the remnant cholesterol (that he would get from subtraction of LDL-C and HDL-C from TC) will be more relevant to all-cause mortality than LDL-C\n\nTable 1.

[1:53:30]\n\nDave believes that lean mass hyper-responders are powered much more by triglycerides carried within VLDL particles, and therefore having more subsequent LDL particles\nPeter believes that it is the higher degree of cholesterol synthesis, which may or may not also be matched by a higher degree of absorption, that’s driving LDL-P higher\n\nA case study from Dave of a lean mass hyper-responder [1:56:30]\nDave says Craig Moffitt (Figure 20) is an example of a lean mass hyper-responder:\n\nVery high TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and low TG and calculated remnant cholesterol\nCalculated remnant cholesterol = TC [457] – LDL-C [335] – HDL-C [109] = 13 mg/dL\nTG / 5 = 13.4 mg/dL = estimated VLDL-C\nWhere is Craig getting his energy? He’s breaking down and releasing free fatty acids (FFA)\nThe free fatty acids are ultimately making it back to its liver getting packaged into the VLDLs\n\nNote from Tom Dayspring: Albumin trafficked FFA can be brought to any cell that needs it for energy.\n\nWhat we’re talking about the target sites of the muscles for which are making use of triglycerides.\nThe primary purpose of the creation of TG is to replete everything: not just to fuel the muscles, it’s also to put it back into the adipocytes that just now released it as well\nIn other words, Craig Moffitt like many people who are lean mass hyper-responders, if we could install a little turnstile into their adipocytes: we would see that turnstile just spinning like crazy, Dave says\nThat’s because there’s less total adipose mass overall in Craig Moffitt compared to somebody who’s a lot heavier, and therefore there needs to be more global supply of VLDLs relative to somebody else who has a lot more fat mass (i.e., local supply), Dave believes\nPeter wrote a blog post that helps explain fat flux: which ultimately describes the mass (in this case, fat) balance, where de novo lipogenesis + re-esterification = lipolysis [DNL + RE = L] (Figure 21)\nWhen Craig is running, he’s in negative fat flux (or fat efflux)\nPeter also believes that the liver is the “energostat” of the body, a term borrowed from Mark Friedman\nThe job of chylomicrons is to deliver fat based energy\nHDL, not to deliver energy, call it support, generally speaking\nThe liver-derived lipoproteins are pulling double-duty, Dave says\nDave believes there’s a higher secretion of VLDLs overall for lean mass hyper-responders, that lead to relatively more LDL particles remaining in the bloodstream\nPeter argues that it’s unlikely more VLDLs are secreted given that most LMHRs Dave presented have low VLDL-C, and the kinetic studies (e.g., Garvey et al., 2003) show lower VLDL particle concentrations\n\n\nFigure 20.
