He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations? [35:00]; What makes the human brain different than all other species? [44:15]; Imprinting stress to your kids epigenetically [48:00]; The role of stress on memory and the consequences of hypercortisolemia [53:00]; The impact of subjective socioeconomic status and social media on stress levels and health [57:45]; Tips for managing stress in the modern world [1:13:15]; What Robert learned about himself studying the social behavior of baboons [1:25:30]; The multilayered factors behind every human behavior, the context of “good and bad”, and exploring the human capacity of the wild extremes of violence and altruism from moment to moment [1:30:15]; PMS: How two women with identical hormone levels can have completely different emotional experiences [1:34:45]; How much of a role do genes play in depression and other emotional states? [1:38:00]; Why is cortisol elevated under sleep deprivation? [1:46:00]; The impact of stress on cancer [1:50:30]; The impact of stress on atherosclerosis, dementia, addiction, and depression [1:57:00]; Impulsiveness, impaired judgment, and lack of empathy in times of stress [2:01:45]; What advice would Robert give his 25-year-old self?

It doesn’t have intelligence. It’s invisible. In order to unite, we have to recognize our shared humanity.”\n \nThe indigent population and the affluent population—The commonalities and differences in how both populations have been affected [16:15]",

When you add those things together. . . it becomes a societally threatening medical, socioeconomic problem, and we haven’t had that before.”\n\nPaul works with people on both ends of the extreme in terms of the socioeconomic status\nHe says they are both very impacted by this situation\n\nFor the more indigent population…\n\nIt’s added desperation on top of desperation\nHalf the population in this country couldn’t survive and move forward from $500 unexpected costs or a $500 shortfall\nPaul says that this subsection of the society has been sort of left behind\nAnd this is just exacerbating their situation\n\nFor the more affluent population…\n\n“I’ve never seen something that just supercharges this idea that if I fear enough, then I’ll be safe.”\nWe are essentially living in a state of constant hypervigilant discomfort\nWe have become prisoners of the insecurity that we have generated from, for example, the way “news” is presented \nit affects people even who say have enough economic means but still have this pervasive feeling that there’s always, always, always something to fear\nThe fear drives suffering b/c it starts to spiral out of control and people get obsessive with negative thoughts that run  over and over and over\n\n“What is uniting us is this pervasive insecurity. And then these parts of our brain that want to keep us safe go into overdrive and inadvertently make us feel so much more vulnerable.”\n \nThe prevailing feeling of demoralization spanning the population [25:30]\n-Peter describes to Paul a personally feeling of sadness, irritability, and sort of a lack of interest in life at times\n-Paul identifies these feelings of desperation as a sense of demoralization\n\nThis sense of demoralization comes from the idea that no matter what you do and how hard you work…  you can be vulnerable anyway\n“I’m not saying that we should be demoralized, but I’m saying I believe there’s truth to that because I think the world around us leads to that.”\n\nPaul also thinks that we’ve lost our way from a leadership standpoint adding to this problem\n\nPeople expect to be protected from things like this pandemic\nYet, we’ve gotten away from relying on people with real expertise\nInstead, anyone with a strong opinion can use social media to scream louder and louder\n\n \nHealth care workers—What lingering psychological effects might they suffer from this? [35:00]\n\n“I think the trauma is going to be pervasive and even generational.”\nEven before this pandemic, Paul says we have been stretching people to the limit\nThey’re working in a system that doesn’t know them, care about them, value them\n\n“We’ve allowed the systems to evolve into this compounded ignorance where we can’t take care of the people who are supposed to take care of us, and they know that and they’ve known that for a long time, and they’re seeing it come to the forefront.”\nHow would you think about managing the long term toxicity of this because especially if it’s sort of smoldering but not resolved?\n-First, we must acknowledge the trauma\n-Next, we actually need to make things different\n-Paul says that due to the trauma, we will most likely see a rise in things like:\n\nAlcoholism\nDomestic violence\nSuicide\nPeople giving up and walking away from things that are important to them\n\n“If we demoralize the population and we don’t rectify that, it’s not going to be okay. And if somehow it seems to be in six months, that will be a deceit that it will be tempting to just believe that and go on. But we have to have the courage of our convictions to know that that’s not okay.”\nThought experiment: If there’s SAR-CoV-3 in 2030, what do we need to have in place to do a better job than we might be doing today?\n\nWhat we need is an “alliance of common sense” says Paul",

I have to first prioritize looking at truth and can we, the people who would do this, which ideally could be a growing movement led by people with influence and with the ability to say we have to put aside whatever our wishes might be, whatever our animosities might be, that we actually do have to treat this like post 9/11 or like the second world war and say what we need to look at now is truth.”\nThis alliance should be able to be honest that our social, medical, and economic systems are not okay which ultimately results in things like uninsured people showing up at emergency rooms for primary care and demoralizing the staff\n\n \nCould this pandemic be a catalyst for changing the way people think about science, truth, and logic? [46:30]\nPersonal truth vs. absolute truth\n\nAn example of a personal truth would be: Ayrton Senna is the greatest formula one driver of all time\nWith absolute truths: That’s really where science comes in\n“For the majority of society, there’s a blurred line between absolute truth and personal truth or relative truth.”\n–Truth and the brain:\nAbsolute truth resonates with logical systems in our brain. \nRelative truth/personal truth resonates with emotional parts (affective or limbic system) especially when we engage in the world around us\n“I have a thesis that says we as a society are not engaging effectively because we have lost the distinction between those two that lets us make the personal truth secondary to the absolute truth.”\nWhen you let personal truths rule the way you think about things… “you end up thinking everybody who doesn’t believe that it’s an idiot”\n\nPaul says this event could be a catalyst for either \n\nThrowing absolute truth out the window OR\nFor a new prioritization of logic and facts\n\n\nBut for that to occur, he says we need an alliance of common sense where people agree to look at the logic and look at the facts when they disagree even if it goes against their current beliefs\n\nDoes Paul worry that we have spent such a scant period of our evolutionary history with any formal language around logic and science?  \n\nPeter points out that “about one 10th of 1% of our evolutionary history has operated with even the nomenclature of science, the skill set and the tools for logical thought”\n\n⇒ Check out Peter’s article: Why we’re not wired to think scientifically (and what can be done about it)\n\n\nPaul admits that yes, we have mostly been driven by emotion for all of history\nHowever, just because it’s a strong current against us doesn’t mean we can’t band together and paddle upstream\n\n“People’s emotion runs wild and what we need to do is to step up to the plate and develop greater control mechanisms and look at ‘How do we stop misinformation? How do we establish sources that are arbiters of truth outside of politics that are arbiters of what’s actually true?’ And we don’t have that.”\n \nHow our inability to deal with uncertainty exacerbates the problem, and the need for humility [58:00]\nPaul and Peter both agree that as a society we really struggle with being able to say “I don’t know”\n\nInstead, people will come up with things to say they know (hubris)\nBut it’s incredibly important, says Paul, to have the humility to say I don’t know\nScience itself never proves anything, it just provides degrees of certainty \nPeter worries that we aren’t capable of getting to the point of understanding this concept\n\nHumility vs hubris\n\n“Admitting that we don’t know engenders humility, the humility that makes us careful.”\n“Hubris leads people to just declare that they know. And there’s a recklessness to that.”\n\n \nWhat has been Paul’s recipe for self care during this time? [1:06:45]\n\nConnection to others can be an antidote to trauma\nRather than money and success, Paul says this is a time to find things that are truly meaningful\n",

Like that stuff matters the most to us. And it’s also where we generate our own meaning. That’s where I don’t feel demoralized because I know that I have meaning to people and people have meaning to me. And then I can find within myself the strength to put one foot in front of the other, keep doing what needs to be done. Even though I sure do feel demoralized often.”\n \nThe forthcoming challenge of reintegrating back into the world when the quarantines lift [1:14:45]\n\nWe’re going to see more anxiety, more obsessiveness, more panic, more agoraphobia (fear of being outside of the home)\nwe’re going to see more of the unhealthy coping mechanisms like drugs and alcohol\nWe’re going to see more of the unintended results of that, like depression and accidents.\n\n-Why?\n\nBecause there is nothing there to prove that you are safe\n\nThis is about trauma and how this pandemic is traumatizing us and how we paved the way for the trauma of it to be so bad and we need to change that.\nWe need to work for change in the systems that allowed the trauma to happen in the first place … \nIf we don’t… “Then we’ll be the individual sufferer from trauma who is trying to deal with that trauma by pretending everything is okay, which is a natural response because we’re afraid of it and we’re ashamed of it and we don’t know how to deal with it.”\n \nAn urgent need for change which must come through individuals seeking absolute truth and taking action [1:19:15]\nThe common theme: “Those of us who sit here in the peanut gallery who are not in a position of leadership are going to have to sort of become the movement of change. In other words, it’s not enough to just sit around and pontificate about this stuff. We are going to at some point have to do something about it. We’re going to have to take some sort of action.” \n“What we have to do is really unpalatable things. Stand against the status quo, enter into arenas that are politically charged, enter into minefields knowing there’s something unpleasant is going to happen.”",
