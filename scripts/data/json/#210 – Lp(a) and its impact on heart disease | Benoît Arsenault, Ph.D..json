We have to move away from measurements in milligrams per deciliter, which is really influenced by the isoform size of Lp(a).” \n\nnmol/L will give a much better sense of the number of Lp(a) particles in circulation\n\n\nLp(a) is going to be measured through immunoturbidimetric assays and not by NMR\n\nNMR can actually give you a pretty good estimate of LDL particle number, but you have to use antibodies to measure Lp(a)\nPeter misspoke by saying it would require separation by electrophoresis\n\n\n\n \nWhat genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed about Lp(a) [16:00]\nGWAS studies found a much stronger association between the variants of Lp(a) that produce high copy numbers of apolipoprotein(a) and incipient cardiovascular events\n\n3 GWAS studies on Lp(a) were published in 2009; the first one easy by Robert Clark in the UK using the PROCARDIS Consortium\n\nPublished in The New England Journal of Medicine, Genetic Variants Associated with Lp(a) Lipoprotein Level and Coronary Disease\nThey looked at around 3000 people with heart disease and 3000 controls\nThey identified 2 SNPs in the LPA regions that are completely different from one another\nThey showed a dose response effect of these SNPs on Lp(a) levels with a proportional effect on the risk of heart disease\n\nIt was like the first Mendelian randomization study, where they nicely showed that if you had 1 Lp(a)-raising allele, you had higher Lp(a) levels, whereas if you had 2 or more Lp(a)-raising variants, then you had even higher Lp(a) levels, and the risk was proportionally higher\n\n\n\n\nPeter notes that this type of analysis really bridged results from observational epidemiology and clinical trials\nThis type of Mendelian randomization uses a handful of assumptions\n\n1 – In the population sampled, nature randomized different copy numbers of these alleles such that different amounts of protein is produced\n2 – To link something as causal assumes the gene of interest is not doing something else you are unaware of\n",

If that were true, that would make it even more likely the scenario that that’s the source of the merger between apolipoprotein(a) and LDL.” \n\nHow much does Lp(a) go up when a patient takes a statin? \n\nThis depends on the study\nA lot of studies that have shown that statins don’t have an effect\nMost studies have shown a 10% increase in Lp(a) levels\nIf you have low Lp(a) levels and you’re treated with a statin, you’ll still remain with a low Lp(a) level\nIf you have a high Lp(a) level, then you’ll obviously still remain with a high Lp(a) level, although it’s going to be a little bit higher\nIt’s important to notice that Lp(a)-lowering drugs are NOT being tested on top of statin therapy at the moment\nBenoît has published a paper in patients with aortic valve stenosis using the ASTRONOMER trial data, showing Lp(a) increases about 20% in patients on a statin\n\nBut statins are still very effective in patients with high Lp(a), even though they increase it by a small increment \n\n\nPeter notes, “An easy way to think about this would be if you give a statin and let’s say in the most aggressive case, the Lp(a) goes up by 10%, but the apoB comes down by 60%, you’d have to make the case that an Lp(a) is 6-times more atherogenic on a particle for particle basis for that to be an equivalence maneuver.”\n\n \nThe structure of LDL-p and Lp(a) and what makes Lp(a) more atherogenic than an equivalent LDL particle [34:00]\n \nWhat about Lp(a) is so virulent? What makes it more atherogenic on a particle for particle basis as compared to a regular apoB LDL? \n\nBenoît  notes, “On a per particle basis, Lp(a) is much more atherogenic than an equivalent LDL particle” \nThere’s evidence that Lp(a) might influence the rates of thrombosis, because Lp(a) has sequence homology with plasminogen\n\nPlasminogen plays a role in clotting and has antifibrinolytic activity\n\n\nThe most important thing is the number of oxidized phospholipids that are transported by Lp(a)\n\nThis is much higher than the amount of oxidized phospholipids that you see on LDL particles\n\n\nOxidized phospholipids have effects on a wide variety of cells: endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, macrophages, cells of the aortic valve like valvular interstitial cells\n\nNow, they’re sending in signals that will drive pro-inflammatory, maybe pro-thrombotic, and pro-calcifying signals to these cells\nThe action of oxidized phospholipids carried by Lp(a) particles is probably the most important reason why on a per particle basis, Lp(a) is more atherogenic than LDL \n\n\n\nMore about the structure of Lp(a) and what makes it atherogenic [35:30]\nThe structure of LDL\n\nAn LDL is a spherical compound; wrapped around its surface is a single lipoprotein called apoB100 (shown in the figure below)\nPeter asks “How does this interact with apolipoprotein(a) to become Lp(a)?” \n\n",
