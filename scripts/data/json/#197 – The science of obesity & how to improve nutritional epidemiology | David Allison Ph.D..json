So whenever you’re hungry for lunch, just let me know and you can have some sandwiches.”\nFor some people, the clock wouldn’t say it was noon until 1:00 PM \nAnd for some people, it would say it was noon at noon\nHe’d say, “Who would be following the clock and who would be following the actual time?” \n\n\nObese or overweight persons were more likely to follow the clock; this became the external theory\nThis didn’t always work out; another experiment would show that it only holds up under this circumstance\n\n\nHe had to write lots and lots of papers at Vassar College\n\nHe got a great education in writing and thinking there\nThere were not so many tests but lots of papers\nWhen he took physiologic psychology, he would write about the physiologic psychology of obesity\nWhen he took behavioral psych, he wrote about the behavioral obesity\nWhen he took developmental, he wrote about the developmental aspects of obesity\nHe loved being able to look at obesity from so many different angles\n\nNo one researcher does this; everybody’s got their pet thing— this nutrient is toxic, the problem is food marking practices, the problem is cultural, it’s exercise\nThere are so many factors involved and he enjoyed studying it from many angles (and he still does)\n\n\n\n\nHe finished his PhD in the mid to late ‘80’s\nObesity rates then were not as high as they are now\n\nThere have been steady increases\n\n\n\n \nThe moment when the obesity crisis was recognized, and the sloppy science that ensued [13:00]\n\nLooking at the data from the 1700s forward, there have been relatively steady increases in obesity rates in westernized industrialized countries since then\nA wake-up moment occurred in the early ‘90’s with the NHANES III study\n",

(Mickey) Stunkard who did the first major high quality twin and adoption studies\n\nDavid knew Mickey; he was a wonderful man\nHe got Torkel Sorenson and other people to start working on twin studies with the great Nordic data, Sweden, Denmark, and so on, and adoption studies\nIt was the twin and adoption studies coming out of Sweden and Denmark that really nailed it\nFinally in The New England Journal of Medicine with Mickey Stunkard behind it with clear writing, with high quality data, people said, “We got it.

It’s just really hard to do, and telling people to do it and saying, ‘I’ll try to do it,’ is not all that effective.” – David Allison \n\nBehavioral therapy began to be used in the ‘60’s\n\nStewart began thinking about using behavioral therapy to treat obesity\nIt has continued to get better and better since then\n\n\nDavid’s sense is that we have been asymptoting for a long time\n\nWe’re getting incrementally better but not meaningfully better with many of the behavioral/cognitive things\n\n\n\nEarly pharmaceuticals \n\nIn the early 90’s he was a postdoc at the New York Obesity Research Center\n\nAt this time a few people started using pharmaceuticals to treat obesity\nFen-phen is a drug that came up and caught people’s attention\n\nWe now know it’s dangerous and it’s gone\n\n\n\n\nFen-phen is a nickname for two drugs used in combination, phentermine and fenfluramine\nPhentermine is a drug that was and still is approved by the FDA for the treatment of obesity\n\nThough it’s never been approved for long-term\nThis goes back a long way, it’s a catecholaminergic agonist\nIt’s a relatively safe drug; no drug is perfectly safe",

Everybody knows that surgery will cause weight loss and help people live longer. There’s no point in doing this study.”\nLars replied, “You may be right, that it does, but we have to do this study because everybody doesn’t accept and believe that and it hasn’t been shown”\n\n\n\n“We know over and over again, you’ve got to do the experiment” – David Allison\n\nAs John Hunter famously said to Edward Jenner, when Jenner says, “I think,” (and he’s thinking about the first vaccine), Hunter comes back and says, “Why think? Do the experiment. Got to do the experiment and show it.”\n Sjostrom didn’t do a pure experiment, not a randomized trial, but it’s a controlled trial\n\nThe IRB, at the time, didn’t think it was ethical to randomly assign people to either surgery or not\nSo if they were willing to get surgery, Sjostrom would find a closely matched control and give them usual care\nHe showed more than a decade later in the New England Journal of Medicine that surgery reduced the mortality rate \n\nSurgery had very powerful effects on obesity\nIt was clearly a life-saving and a beneficially, life-changing treatment\nThis was probably a big jump\nSince then, many other trials, some randomized, have been done showing positive benefits on many things, including longevity\n\n\n\n\nPeter asks what the risk reduction was in all-cause mortality\n\nDavid doesn’t recall from that study, but looking across studies (as it varies a bit), it’s on the order of a 50% reduction, sometimes a little more\n\n\nHow does this change in patients with and without type 2 diabetes?\n\nDavid doesn’t know off the top of his head, but he shares the intuition that it is probably more beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes\nMany factors are involved\n\n\nOne of the surprising things in the Swedish Obesity Study was the effect on hypertension\n\nDiabetes really came down and stayed down very well, even if weight came back up a little (which it did, on average)\nHypertension came down as well, but did not stay down; it would come back up\n\nWhy was this?\nIs it damage to the endothelial elasticity that’s not really repairable, and so you get a short-term effect of negative energy balance that’s not sustained?\n\nIt goes back to the need to do the experiment\nYou can’t make priority assumptions about the effects of treatments\nYou’ve got to do the experiment and look at the effects of treatments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter notes, “it’s interesting that hypertension would return and yet mortality would still improve”\n\nIt’s surprising because of how causally related hypertension is to atherosclerosis\nThis suggests perhaps that the benefits of improved insulin sensitivity preserve and play a greater role in mortality than body weight\nDavid notes that hypertension may be an additional role and if it too could be reduced over the long term, there would be an even bigger reduction in mortality\n\n\n\n \nThe ‘Obesity Paradox’ [36:00]\nWhen did the idea of the ‘Obesity Paradox’ start to be observed?\n\nThat phrase ‘Obesity Paradox’ has never been really crisply defined\n\nAnd whether it really is something that’s a paradox is not clear\n\n\nPeople use it to mean at least 2 different things\n\nThere’s this so-called U-shaped curve, more accurately concave upward, it’s a bathtub shaped curve (see the figure below)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

We can observe lots of associations, but it’s just hard to know what to make of all of these associations, and what’s causal.” – David Allison\n\nThere are multiple hypotheses that are consistent with the data\n\nThat’s why the randomized experiment allows us to do things that otherwise we can’t do, sort of eliminates more competing hypotheses\nWe don’t know what’s causal yet\n\n\nWe have thrown out 1 model\nDavid and his postdoc (Doug Childers, a good mathematician) asked 2 questions:\n\n1) What if obesity makes it more likely that you get a major illness or injury\n\nCould this be why obesity is associated with a risk of early mortality?\n\n\n2) Once you get a major illness or injury, does being heavier (more obese) reduce your risk of dying from it?\nCompare to this analogy— suppose we are going on a hike in the Grand Canyon\n\nWe go to an outfitter and he says, “you’re about 10 years younger than me; you have a choice.  I can give you this fat suit you can wear, it has lots of padding on it. If you fall off the cliff, it makes it much more likely you’ll survive, but it makes you a little clumsy. So it makes you more likely to fall off the cliff”  \nYou might think that you have good balance and eyesight, you’re  young and strong; so you say no to the fat suit\nSomebody 10 years older may be struggling with eyesight, balance, or strength; and they may say yes, “I’ll take the fat suit”\nAnd so whether the fat suit is good for you may depend upon the probability of falling, to begin with\n\n\nUnder that mathematical model, David can show, in fact, that the point of BMI, the nadir of that bathtub shape concave upward curve, should keep moving to the right as you age, which is exactly what it does\n\nThey have a model that’s consistent with the data, but the data don’t prove their model\nThere are other models that would be consistent with it\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting some numbers to it\n\nPeter notes that this U-shaped curve gives an optimal BMI, a BMI associated with the lowest mortality (see the figure below)\n\nIs David suggesting that instead of using 1 plot for everybody, graph it by decade?\nWhat does this U-shape cure look like for people in their 20s, 30s, 30s…up to 90s?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.
