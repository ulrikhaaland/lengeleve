It needs sensory stimulation. When we don’t have that, those neuronal circuits aren’t getting exercised, and they’re more likely to atrophy.”‒ Kellyann Niotis  \n\nWhen we don’t have the proper sensory input, those neuronal circuits aren’t getting exercised, and they’re more likely to atrophy\n\nIf you don’t use it, you lose it\n\n\nIn relation to your question, yes, Kellyann thinks that that visual processing is why you have the depth perception issues that you see in Lewy body\n\nHow does vascular dementia overlap with frontal dementia? \n\nWhen Peter thinks of vascular dementia, he thinks of small vessel disease that’s similar to atherosclerotic disease, basically some form of ischemia\n\nWhy is that unique to the frontal cortex and why is that not something that the rest of the brain is just as sensitive to? \n\nVascular dementia overlaps more with Alzheimer’s dementia, they are very difficult to discern clinically",

    "content": "\nClassically, the speed of processing issues are more prevalent in vascular dementia versus Alzheimer’s disease, which is more of a memory issue\nBut when we’re looking at metabolic changes in the brain, we see that the frontal lobe is hypometabolic in terms of glucose utilization, in frontotemporal dementia and in vascular dementia\n\nWhy is that? \n\nIt’s hard to know exactly, but it may have something to do with the vasculature of the brain and what areas of the brain are more sensitive to glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, and vascular risk factors\nPeter adds, “It’s very interesting because there is such a high association with diabetes in this condition. But my recollection is that the brain doesn’t require insulin the way the rest of the body does to facilitate glucose transport into neurons.”\n\nSo insulin resistance should not be an issue in the brain \nBut he has seen experimental data that look at intranasal insulin injections, and they temporarily alleviate some of the symptoms associated with this type of dementia\nThis suggests, paradoxically, that maybe insulin resistance is playing a role\n\n\nHe wonders if the metabolic syndrome that is associated with type 2 diabetes is simply a marker of the underlying vascular problems as well\nKellyann agrees, the clinical data is really interesting\nShe does cognitive testing on a ton of patients\n\nThey get to look at this in real time and compare it to serum biomarkers\n\n\nThinking about high cholesterol, patients with high ApoB often have a reduced speed of processing\n\nAnd clinically she sees that if you correct things like ApoB, you see improvement in the speed of processing\n\n\n\nWhat is the time course to see a response to interventions?   \n\nIt can happen rather quickly over a course of 6 months, but it’s dependent on the person\nThis is also the approach Peter takes with his patients, but he doesn’t have as many with MCI (mild cognitive impairment) as she was seeing in her clinic \n\nIs there a point at which you just didn’t see any improvement in symptoms regardless of intervention? \n\nEveryone is different\nThere are a lot of different factors that could influence something like executive function and speed of processing\nWhat’s most helpful is looking at the individual\n\nPutting their lab values and an understanding of what their risk factors are next to each other\n\n\nFor example, if you see somebody who has out of control cholesterol, and you’re looking at their executive function in tasks like generating words that start with F or A or S, (that’s a really popular test) that gives us clues into the question‒ “Is the vascular risk factor affecting this person’s cognition?” \n\nThe chance that intervening on their cholesterol will have a notable outcome in the next 6, 12, 18 months is pretty high\nBut it depends on the person, and it also depends on what other factors are playing a role\nFor example, sleep is huge, “I can’t emphasize enough how important sleep is to speed of processing. If you are getting crap sleep, you really aren’t going to see a high speed of processing.” \n\nYou really have to be sleeping in order to process information\nWe’ll come back to this topic and sleep staging\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter’s takeaway:\n\nYou have these 3 areas of the brain that can be impacted, that can lead to various types of dementia and each of them seems horrible in their own right\nIronically, Alzheimer’s seems the least horrible in that it’s mostly a deficit of memory and language relative to robbing you of executive function, processing speed in the front of the brain\nMeanwhile, movement disorders and visual disorders are problems in the back of the brain\nBut to be sure, these are all awful conditions\n\n \nOverview of Parkinson’s disease and neuromuscular disorders including ALS [16:00]\n\nALS and Parkinson’s disease are very different because ALS is more of a peripheral nerve problem\n\nALS is probably the worst disease of them all\n\n\nParkinson’s disease is more of a central problem, more related to Lewy body dementia\n\nHow many people are affected by these diseases? \n\nALS is really rare, only about 18,000 people in the US have ALS,\nParkinson’s disease is much more common, a million people in the US have Parkinson’s disease\n\nThe incidence of Parkinson’s disease actually doubled in the last 25 years\nIt’s the fastest growing neurological condition\n\n",

What explains the fact that you said earlier Parkinson’s is the fastest growing neurodegenerative condition in the US? \n\nGreat question\nThere have been a lot of theories hypothesizing why the prevalence of Parkinson’s disease will grow in the future\nOne of them is smoking (this makes her laugh a little), fewer cases of Parkinson’s occurs in smokers\n\nLess people are smoking now, but she doesn’t believe this is what’s driving disease\nShe doesn’t think smoking offers that much protection to your brain, and it’s doing so many other terrible things for your brain and body that it’s just not something to ever consider when we’re thinking about ways to optimize our health\n\n\nInflammatory bowel disease is also protective against Parkinson’s\n\nShe thinks it has a lot to do with the movements that were going through day to day and how much screen time we’re spending every day \n\nIt may be loss of movement capacity\nRichard also talked about this in his podcast, the idea of building as much cognitive reserve as possible\nYou want to do the same with your body\n\nYou want to build up as much movement reserve as possible because if you don’t use it, you lose it \n",

I would say that we’re probably at least 10 years behind the field of Alzheimer’s disease and we will identify more genetic risk factors for this disease.”\nShe has seen a number of patients with a clear family history in multiple family members, and testing for every know gene has turned up nothing\n\nThere’s clearly something there that we are missing\n\n\nPeter relates this to breast cancer again, “We see this also with breast cancer, we see women in whom breast cancer runs in the family up and down, sideways, and they test negative for every known gene associated. But you’ve got to tell that woman, your daughter’s at risk even though we can’t identify what the genes are.”\nKellyann agrees, this makes it really challenging as a provider, “Because we love looking at genes, because it gives us a clue to what the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanism that may be driving the disease that they may be at risk for” \n\nWe’re really grabbing at straws, and just throwing everything under the kitchen sink at a person, because we don’t really have a clear sense of what pathway they’re on \n \nInterventions to delay or avoid Parkinson’s disease, and the role of sleep and anxiety [31:15]\nWhat do you say to that person who’s 40 years old, who is having sleep disturbances, that we now think has a high likelihood of disease? \n\nThe idea here being that those sleep disturbances are the canary in the coal mine for this problem occurring in their brain\n\nWhat steps should this person take to maximize the odds of avoidance or at least maximize delay of disease? \n\nThere is no one-size fits all; it really depends on the person\n1 – The first thing Kellyanne would want to do is check out their genes\n\nLet’s say there’s nothing wrong with those 2 genes (GBA and LRRK2, discussed earlier).  What else do you want to know? \n\n2 – What toxic exposures could they have?\n\nWhere did they grow up?\nWere they drinking well water or city water?  \n\n\n\nHypothetically, let’s say they grew up on a farm, but now they don’t live anywhere near it.  And now there’s nothing actively contributing to it from an exposure standpoint. \n\nTheir exposure is only in the past, it’s no longer present\n3 – A movement assessment is absolutely key\nWe see abnormal movement patterns in these patients years and years before tremor, slow movements start\nAnd the patterns that we see are very similar among people\n",

It’s actually the one thing that has made our progress for ASCVD so great  \nTangent on ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) \n\nWe have a really good biomarker in ApoB and LDL-C\nWe have this causative agent, it’s necessary though not sufficient to cause disease\nYou know almost without exception, that lowering that thing will lower the incidence of disease\nThen it simply becomes a question of how long do you need to study it in your given population to see the reduction? \nThe problem is: We don’t yet have a clear biomarker for Parkinson’s \n\nDifferences in the histopathology of neurodegenerative diseases [43:30]\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is what we call a tauopathy\n\nYou see a lot of amyloid and tau proteins\n\n\nParkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia are called alpha-synucleinopathy\n\nSo a different toxic protein (α-synuclein) builds up in these diseases",
