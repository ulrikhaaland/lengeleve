    "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter and Bob take a deep dive into olive oil. They explore the history of olive oil, discuss observational data that led to the hypothesis that olive oil is a healthier alternative to many other fats, and they explain the classification of olive oil types —including what to look for in a high-quality “extra virgin” olive oil. Peter and Bob round out the discussion with a “two-minute drill,” in which Peter answers questions from subscribers. They cover zone 5 training, an update on Peter’s book, lactate meters, standing desks, massage guns, electrolyte supplementation, and more.\nIf you’re not a subscriber and listening on a podcast player, you’ll only be able to hear a preview of the AMA.

Comparing fat composition of various oils. \nOlive oil\n\nOleic acid, a MUFA, is the main fatty acid in olive oil\n\nHow does that compare to some of the other fats out there?\nSoybean oil\n\nMost processed foods contain soybean oil which is made up of about about 24% MUFA, 16% SFA, and 53% PUFA\nBy comparison, olive oil is about 75% MUFA\n\nLard\n\nPeople think of lard as a “brick of saturated fat”\nBut it is actually about 46% MUFA, 42% SFA, and about 10% PUFA\n\nCorn oil \n\nCorn oil is also commonly found in processed foods\nIt’s makeup is similar to soybean oil—29% MUFA, 13% SFA, and 57% PUFA\n\n“Naturally occurring oils”\n\nWhen it comes to naturally occurring oils, there’s basically two that really concentrate MUFA—olive oil and safflower oil\n\nOmega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\n\nWith vegetable oils (PUFAs), there’s only one that is high in omega-3—flaxseed oil\nIt should be noted that it’s not a substitute for marine sources of omega-3 polyunsaturated fats that are high in EPA and DHA\nThe major modern seed oils are generally very high in the omega-6 polyunsaturated fats—corn oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, and cottonseed oil—each of those being at least 50% omega-6 \nThey also contain some SFA—corn oil is 13% saturated, soybean is 16%, sunflower 11%, and cottonseed is 27% \n\nHighest in saturated fat\n\nLard is 42% saturated, \nbeef tallow is 52%, \nbutter is 68%, \ncoconut oil is 91%\n\nNOTE: Any food with fat is going to have all three, but coconut oil is the one that’s mostly saturated fat.\nEngineered oils\n\nThese oils are engineered to boost the oleic content to essentially match that of olive oil\nhigh-oleic sunflower is 86%\nhigh-oleic canola at 76%\n\n \nDefining “extra virgin” olive oil, what to look for when purchasing, and Peter’s favorite brand [34:30]\nExtra virgin olive oil—What defines the virginity of an oil?\n\nThere are legal requirements for extra virgin olive oil set by the International Olive Council\nOlive oils must have certain tastes and chemical properties that are extra virgin grade\nThere is literally people that are tasting oils to see if they actually meet extra virgin requirements\nOther stipulations are an oil must be made from healthy, expertly picked olives, milled within 24 hours of the harvest to preserve their flavors and avoid spoilage\n\n“This is an art as much as it is a science.” —Peter Attia\nFor more on this, check out the book Extra Virginity\n\nThe author, Tom Mueller, also an article in the New Yorker: Slippery Business \nWhat Tom and others argue is that when looking at the chemical constituents of an olive oil, it’s easy to be fooled into thinking that an olive oil is extra virgin\nBut based on taste, literally swishing it in your mouth like wine, there are particular taste profiles that determine whether these things are extra virgin or not\n",

    "content": "\nThings to look for in a quality olive oil:\n1 – Cost \n\nThe good olive oil is expensive.\nIf it’s cheap, it’s probably not great\n\n2 – Harvest date\n\nInstead of an expiration date on these bottles, you’ll see something that’s called a harvested date which tells you when they actually harvested the olives\nyou want a harvested date within 18 months\nunlike wine, this stuff doesn’t get better with age\n\n3 – smell and taste\n\nIt should smell fresh like grass or something fruity\nTaste: it should have a bitter, peppery taste that bites the back of the throat\n\n4 – “Pure” and “Light” descriptors is a bad sign\n“The area that I got burned on is whenever they use words like pure and light and things like that. To me, that’s code for garbage. I mean, it literally means pure garbage.” —Peter \n\nThe IOC can’t tell you that something is EVOO because of the macros in it, but the reverse is true\nIf you look at a pure or light olive oil, it’s often very high in PUFA and significantly lower in MUFA — So, it’s pretty clear when you’re looking at something that’s bogus in that regard\n\n5 – Where it was produced \n\nThe label should tell you where that olive oil was produced\nSometimes it will tell you it’s produced in multiple places, which means they’re harvesting in different places, and they’re mixing those olives together suggesting it’s not as pure or consistent as they are likely all harvested at different times\n\n6 – How it’s bottled\n\nit should be in a dark cool place\nThe darker glass bottle helps preserve the olive oil\nif you have fats that are unsaturated, particularly polyunsaturated fats, they can be more prone to oxidation — so when you have the darker bottle, there’s less likelihood of that happening\n\n***\nBrand Peter likes: Kosterina \nPeter’s aha moment\n\nPeter stumbled upon a store that only sold olive oil\nThe store had big metal canisters with little spigots on them that you could dole out olive oil onto little plates and sample them with bread\nHe was blown away at the strength of the taste of some of these oils\nMany of them had that peppery bitter taste in the back of the throat\nThe oils were also “comically pricey” says Peter\nThis experience made Peter think: “I need to up my game a little bit on olive oil because if there is any benefit to this, I want to make sure I’m getting it.”\nOverall, Peter says that the breadth of information we have on olive oil makes him think that being thoughtful about the olive oil you consume is worth the effort\n\nPeter’s approach with his patients\n\nOn a clinical level, Peter’s approach with patients regarding fat intake is optimal is a function of a number of things — Namely, how much carbohydrate and how much protein you need\nBut whether a person’s diet is going to be 40% fat or 60% fat or more or less, his belief is that no less than 50% of that should be monounsaturated, and ideally closer to 60%\n\nSo, what are the ideal sources for those monounsaturated fats? \n\ni) olive oil, \nii) macadamia nuts, and \niii) avocados\n\n“Those become a great way to achieve your MUFA goals, and that’s part of what we consider the appropriate distribution of fat.” —Peter Attia\n***\nOne more thing to consider: Olive oil made from an “early harvest” may be better\n\nConsider the premise that there may be deleterious effects of excess linoleic acid, n-6 PUFA\n\nOr for simplicity purposes, that you’d rather have more MUFA than PUFA in your diet\n\n\nWith these olive oils, depending on the ripeness of the olive, the fatty acid composition has a range\n\nIn other words, the oleic acid within the olive oil can vary from 55% to 83% of the total fat in the olive oil\nSo you could have two extra virgin olive oils because the extra virginity of it doesn’t speak to its distribution of oil (It’s really a function of the harvest, the taste, etc.)",

[Beltrán et al., 2004]\n\nAccording to the literature,\n\nDuring the ripening process, the more ripe the fruit, the ratio of MUFA to PUFA falls — So, the polyunsaturated fat content is greater\nBasically, the earlier you harvest, the unripe olive is going to give you the highest amount of oleic acid and the least amount of linoleic acid\n\n\n\n“If you buy the argument that oleic is good, which I buy, and if you buy the argument that linoleic is suboptimal, which I’m not sure I buy, the earlier is better.” —Peter Attia\n \nUpdate on Peter’s book [47:15]\n\nAbout 12 months ago, Peter decided to change publishers\nHe is currently shopping around for a new publisher\nThis has pushed back the release of his book \nThe good news is that he does have a manuscript ready to be reviewed by an editor\nPeter’s hope is that the book hits shelves in January of 2022\n\n \nZone 5 training: Peter’s approach to zone 5 training, and other anaerobic training protocols [49:30]\nPeter’s zone 5 protocol\nOn his stairmaster:\n\nOne time per week using a stairmaster\n4 minute pattern:\n\n3 minutes of zone 2\n1 minute at his VO2 max\nRepeat for 20-30 minutes\n\n\nHe usually does this on the tail end of a zone two workout (his longer aerobic day)\nNote: Peter knows his VO2 max and also knows the conversion to METS which the stairmaster can track\n\nHe also does zone 5 on his bike:\n\nFour minutes at 125% of FTP (functional threshold power)\nFollowed by four minutes recovery\nA one to one work/rest at a lower intensity than the 3 to 1 one rest to work that described on the stairmaster\n\n“My view is most people spend too much time there and not enough time in zone 2.” —Peter Attia\nFollow up questions:\nWhat kind of stairmaster does Peter use?\n\nThe stairmaster Peter uses is a series of eight-inch steps that roll up and down (like an escalator)\nThe higher the intensity you set it, the less resistance is in those steps and the faster you have to go to not fall off the back\nIf Peter sets it to 8 METs, there’s actually quite a bit of resistance so he can step quite slowly without falling off\nBut when set to 20 METs, it feels like there’s no resistance and he’s running up the stairs to not get thrown off the back\n\nIs it possible to go “all-out” or 100% for an extended period of time?\n\nBasically, the limits of human performance in terms of “going all out” is about 10 seconds (despite what your spin class instructor might tell you)\n\nSee Alex Hutchin’s book, Endure\nAlso, check out the podcast episode with Alex\n\n\nYou only need to look at the difference between a 100-meter and a 200-meter sprint\n\nSo, take the best explosive athletes on the planet — even by the time Usain Bolt is running the 200m, he is slowing down in the second half of that race\nThe force with which he’s able to hit the ground in the second half of that race is slower\nThe 100-meter race is basically a 10-second race is about the true limit of what “all out” means\n\n\n\nLet’s look at tabata workouts:\n\nConsider two variants of Tabata: i) The 20:10 (20 sec spring with 10 sec recovery) and ii) the 10:20 (10 sec sprint with 20 sec recovery)\nAir bikes are a great tool for doing these types of workouts\nYou can go so much harder for the 10:20 than the 20:10\nThe 20:10 is generally favored because that’s the one that was studied by Izumi Tabata (the guy who wrote the papers) and Koichi Irisawa (the guy who actually developed the workout protocol)\nThe problem with a “20:10 Tabata” is whether consciously or subconsciously you’re actually pacing yourself to complete it\n\n***",

More Calories burned? Less Muscle tightness? Less overstretching?\n\nIt depends on how engaged you are, meaning if you sit with no attention to the muscles of the abdomen and the thorax, sitting can be actually quite detrimental\nGenerally speaking, when standing you have more engaged paraspinal muscles, abdominal muscles, obliques, transversalis, etc.\nThat said, you can stand in a horrible manner and still be doing harm relative to walking\nWalking is preferred to sitting not just because of the energy expenditure, but because it forces you to actively engage muscles that prevent you from a bad postural position\n\nMost common postural mishaps: \n\nAnterior pelvic tilt\nRib flared upward lordotic position \n“It’s very easy to stand in that position.”\n\n\nFigure 3. Anterior pelvic tilt. [source]\n⇒ Check out episode of the Drive with Beth Lewis and Michael Rintala \nHow Peter avoids the issues from sitting:\n\nHe spends a lot of time practicing sitting in a very actively engaged way\nHe also don’t sit for hours at a time\nHe is constantly getting up and moving around\n\nIs sitting the new smoking? \n“I don’t know”, says Peter, “I understand the sentiment of that statement, but I’m not sure I’d take it quite that far.”\n“I’d say inactivity, in general, might be the new smoking of which sitting is a component.” —Peter Attia\n \nLactate meters and strips [57:45]\nWhat strips or devices are good enough for the regular guy to measure lactate levels to confirm zone two after exercise? \nThere seem to be some very expensive devices out there. Is there something decent for home use?”\n\nPeter currently uses the Lactate Plus by Nova\n\nThis one is easy to get, but it’s also not cheap, and the cost of the strips are very expensive at ~$4 each\nThere may be a more affordable device + strips out there but Peter can’t speak to that\nYou can pace yourself at the frequency with which you want to do lactate testing\n\n\nWhen to use the meter:\n\nPeter personally does the lactate test every single time he does his zone 2 workouts — “That’s not necessary… [but] I’m obsessed with it so that’s why I do it.”\n“Once you get your groove on and identify your zone 2 and start to figure out what roughly corresponds to it heartrate-wise and power-wise (if you’re using wattage), I think your cost of use will go down.”\n\n\n\n⇒ For more on zone 2 and lactate testing, check out AMA #19 \n \nElectrolyte supplementation during fasting and keto, and why uric acid may increase [59:30]\nAfter listening to the Dom D’Agostino AMAs (Part 1 and Part 2) and the Rick Johnson episode, a subscriber has a question about electrolyte supplements as well as about salt and uric acid and ketogenesis:\nIf salt does this conversion to fructose in the body, how is that affecting keto?\n\n“Good question. I don’t think I know the answer.” says Peter \nAs a general rule, the salt supplementation in keto is really not necessary for everyone, and personally for Peter, he doesn’t find it necessary during his brief periods of keto (and even when he’s short periods of fasting)\nHowever, during the longer fasts, Peter does need sodium, but that’s because he’s not eating food and he’s trying to just get sodium back to normal levels\nIn keto, he does not supplement sodium at all, but he does supplement magnesium",

How similar and effective are each of these?\nProfessional massage: \n\nMost effective with the strong caveat that it’s highly dependent on the person giving the treatment\n\nMassage guns: \n\nBe careful — it’s easy to go too hard with them so be mindful of not putting too much tension into the tissue\n\n⇒ For example: Many think that if they feel pain or tightness in their back, for example, the best strategy is to just pulverize the muscle to loosen it up\n\nBut the reality is that perhaps your back hurts because your QLs and paraspinous muscles have seized up\nAnd what people are missing in that situation is that they’ve seized up to protect you — your brain is basically saying, “You are in an unsafe position. I’m going to protect you by reducing your range of motion and I’m going to do that by locking these muscles in place.”\nSo the massage gun isn’t really addressing the problem, and often it doesn’t necessarily make you feel that much better\nA better course of action may be:\n\nMore gentle massage work coupled with muscle relaxants \nThen of course fixing the underlying problem\n\n\n\nFoam rollers:\n\nThey are a reasonable tool\nPeter doesn’t use them that much anymore\nHis warmups now are much more dynamic and less about tissue preparation\n\n",
