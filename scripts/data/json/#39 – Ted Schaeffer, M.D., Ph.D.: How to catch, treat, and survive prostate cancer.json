Part of the reason you were attracted to immunology is you felt it was a weakness, and having spoken with a number of very good scientists, I find that to be a very common thread (Peter saw this trait in his mentor, Steven Rosenberg)\nThe exciting transition in science during Ted’s PhD in the 1990s\n==> No longer single gene, single change \n\nAt the time (1990s), people were still focusing on “single gene, single change” and that “you have this mutation, you get this cancer, this mutation, you have this phenotype”\nIn other words, people were thinking “digital” rather than “analog”\n\nDigital meaning, it’s either on or off\nAnalog meaning, there is an infinite number of iterations in between, like a volume knob on your rado\n\n\nBut there was a transition in thinking, especially in immunology, that it was much more complex that than\nThe tools to explore and test that on multigene levels were coming online in science at that time\n\nTed’s PhD work focused on tyrosine kinase: “So it turns out that the tyrosine kinases that I worked on my PhD are really involved in fine tuning the T-cell receptor signaling . . . they really fine tuned the signal. It’s not off or on.”\nTyrosine kinase: what it is and why it’s relevant\n\nWe all have unique DNA in every cell in our body\nBut within each person, there is variability with what the cells do with the DNA code\nAnd exposure to environment, for example, can result in epigenetic change\nThis change results in a protein\n\nProteins\n\nThey are not inert, they can change\nPieces of the proteins can be modified through kinases\nTyrosine kinase is just one type of kinase\nKinases have become a very attractive target for drugs\n\nDrugs target kinases\n⇒ The idea in cancer biology is to find alterations to find mutations to find changes that you can “target” to do precision oncology, precision medicine. And so these are one of the ways that we’re beginning to think about advancing the medicine in that special way.\nGleevec\n\nGleevec, for example, targets a specifically altered/fused gene of tyrosine kinase\nIt is able to cure chronic myeloid cancer (CML) ⇒ this is an exception, however, in that it targets a single gene and has a curative effect\n\n“But for most cancer a single agent like Gleevec isn’t going to work because the [cancer] cells change and alter, but doing double or triple targeting will be an effective long term approach for those. Just like we’ve learned from HIV management.”\nTed’s advice to MD-PhD students, and why he choose urology and Johns Hopkins [23:45]\nWhat advice would you give them to select a good lab?\n\nFind the right people to work with: “when you have an amazing mentor, it’s like everything works out”\nYou must also have internal motivation and drive\nDo your best to find something you’re passionate about\nHave a clear understanding of this idea of translation: You can do science for science sake, but to me to make really big impacts, you have to be able to translate that to the human condition\nGet some clinical time in BEFORE doing your PhD ⇒ you will know really key nuances that were important for understanding the right questions to ask\n“This might be the nugget of the podcast” says Peter\n\nWhy did you choose Urology? Why Hopkins?\n\nFather was a urologist\nTed’s grandfather got sick and died of prostate cancer\nAlso wanted to work with his hands\nDecided he wanted to be a prostate cancer scientist and surgeon\n\nJohns Hopkins\n\nBest urology program in the US\nChairman was Pat Walsh, the godfather of urology and prostate cancer surgery\nThe people at Hopkins are amazing\n“I’ll never forget just the pursuit of excellence. That was really the epitome of Hopkins.”\nPat Walsh pointed out that Johns Hopkins was a “negative selector”: “People come here because they want to pursue excellence. They don’t come here because there’s a good nightlife. They don’t come here because of X, Y, or Z. They come here for that single reason.”\n\nHistory of prostate surgery, and Pat Walsh’s legendary work in prostate cancer [36:15]\n“I can’t think of someone in the last 30 years that has so fundamentally changed the course of one operation, its impact on one disease, as Pat.”\nQuote from Pat Walsh: “You can’t make important discoveries unless you work on important problems.”\nBefore Walsh, if someone had prostate cancer, what were the treatment options?\n\nVery few had surgery\nLife-threatening due to blood loss\nMany ended of with urinary leakage and losing sexual function\n\nWhy is blood loss from prostate surgery so deadly?\n\nLarge number of veins (not arteries)",

If you looked at me, you got an NG tube and it didn’t hurt.”\n\nPat Walsh’s approach to prostate surgery\n\nFor blood loss… He understood where the veins were and he controlled them by suturing them before they started bleeding. \nBy doing that, you could actually see everything. (like going from operating in the dark to in the daylight)\nFor retaining potency: this was not so obvious, but he figured that part out by working with some anatomists and really just studying and talking to his patients and listening to what they had to say\nHe would record and rewatch all his cases to learn from his mistakes\n\nDr. Pat Walsh’s video of his operations: \n\nSee also Pat Walsh performs a prostatectomy in the 1970s: The Art of Retropubic Prostatectomy – Joseph J. Kaufman, MD and Patrick C. Walsh, MD \nProstate surgery and the risks involved with treatment [53:00]\nOdds of regaining sexual function and having no problems with urinary leakage?\n\nNot 100%, and it’s because the nerves are not myelinated\nNearly all other nerves in the body have myelination\n\nUrinary leakage\n\nAbout 4% of cases, on average, have urinary leakage (more common in women and older men)\nOnly 2% of Ted’s patients report urinary leakage\n\nSexual function\n\nFor a 50 year old man, over 90% will regain function (if Ted’s patient)\nBut ED is an age-related dysfunction, so the older the patient the higher the chance of not fully regaining function\n\nThe neurovascular bundle of Walsh\n\nThe bundle of nerves all around the prostate make it hard to remove without taking some of the nerves as well\nAnd the bigger the tumor the more nerves much be removed\n\nScreening for prostate cancer [58:00]\nWhat is prostate-specific antigen (PSA)?\n\nThe biggest controversy in prostate cancer\nPSA is a protein made by the prostate\nIt’s function is to liquefy semen\n\nProstate is like a sewer system\n\nYou have the main sewer leaving the city, that’s the urethra\nBut not just urine, this channel also delivers semen out the tip of the penis\nOff this main sewer are slightly smaller sewers that go to different neighborhoods\nWithin the neighborhood, there’s a sewer that comes out of the individual house\nThe individual houses in this analogy are prostate epithelial cells\nEpithelial cells make the components of the semen\nSemen is used to give nutrients to the sperm while it’s trying to fertilize an egg\nPSA is a protein that breaks down the semen and liquefies it, which is an important process of in making fertilization possible\n\nHow do we use the PSA number as a tool to screen for prostate cancer? ⇒ we check the values of the PSA in the blood\n\nThis was discovered in the 1980s\nSome PSA gets into the bloodstream (some is normal for everyone)\nThe bigger the prostate, the more PSA leaks into the blood\nThe older the person, generally the more PSA in blood\n\nSo what can make the PSA rise besides just getting older and having a larger prostate? \n\nAn infection\nCancer in the prostate\n\nSo what is a normal PSA? \n\nAge-adjusted\nA 40 year old is around .5 to .6 nanograms per ml\nA 50 year old, the normal is 1.0 \n*No PSA number, no matter how low, guarantees that you don’t have cancer\nBut for a younger person, higher than 2.5 is cause for more workup\nAn older person, higher than 4.0 is concerning\nBut not yet time for a biopsy\n\nPercent free PSA:\nThis was the first way that urologists began to look at what’s the chance that a PSA of 4.0 is coming from a cancer versus a PSA of 4.0 coming from just benign overgrowth\nExample,\n\nTwo guys have a PSA of 4.0\nPerson A has a free PSA of 1.0, so he’s 25 percent free PSA\nPerson B has a free PSA of 3.0, which is 75 percent free\nThere’s less bound PSA in the lower percent free, and that’s more often associated with prostate cancer\nA high percent free PSA is associated with a big prostate and less of a chance of prostate cancer\nA low percent free PSA is associated with a higher likelihood that that PSA’s produced from a gland with prostate cancer in it\nSo Person A is more likely to have cancer\n\nPSA density:\n\nPSA number divided by volume of prostate: So 4.0 PSA/40 gram prostate= density of .1\nPSA density more than .1 or .15  raises a red flag\nSo an 80 gram prostate (which is big) with a PSA of 4.0 is a density of .05, on avg. that person does not have cancer\n\nFour-kallikrein test (4k score) and the Prostate Health Index (PHI)\n\nTwo new tests that leverage off the idea that prostate cancer cells make PSA differently than benign prostate cells\nBoth tests are equally accurate and interchangeable\nPeter calls the 4k test a “game changer” at his practice\n\n4k score\n\n4k test has figured out a way to give a binary answer\nBelow 7.5% means you have a 1.6 percent chance to die in 20 years\nAbove 7.5% means you have a continuous variable chance the higher the percentage\n\nThe 7.5% cut off on the 4k test based on the database from Vickers and Hans Lilja: Improving the Specificity of Screening for Lethal Prostate Cancer Using Prostate-specific Antigen and a Panel of Kallikrein Markers: A Nested Case–Control Study (Stattin et al., 2016)\n\nFigure 1. 4k score 7.5% cutoff. Image credit: 4kscore.com\nThe “mass screening” controversy [1:12:45]\n\nIn the 1940s, 40% of men coming in with prostate cancer had metastatic at presentation\nEpidemic of deaths of prostate cancer\nTom Stamey and Bill Catalona figured out we could look at PSA numbers to catch cancer earlier\n1990 FDA approved the test and set forth arbitrary cutoffs \n\nThe idea of “mass screening” controversy began\n\nThe argument against mass screening is that it would lead to people being treated who didn’t need it, and the treatment process is not safe or cheap and can be hard on people\nSkeptics said it was a way for urologists to make money\n“No, it wasn’t that. It was because at the time the test was developed, it was the first biomarker for cancer. Pick up a cancer early, if you pick it up, treat it and cure that patient.”\nOver the next decade, this test reduced deaths from cancer, as well as reducing the incidence of metastatic cancer at presentation\nPlaying devil’s advocate, Peter says, well that’s just lead time bias\nFortunately, the skeptics are losing ground on the argument against prostate screening, even “anti-screeners” like Peter Albertsen are coming around\n\nNot all prostate cancer is lethal\n\nInitially we developed a biomarker to pick up all prostate cancers ⇒ the PSA blood test\nWe picked them up, we treated them, we reduced deaths but we also over-treated people\nPeople who had a cancer that would never have been lethal in their lifetime, so the screening tools got better (4k, PHI, etc.)\n\nThe over-simplified screening protocol of today\n\nPSA test first (including free PSA, PSA density)\nHowever, it’s important to not in 10-15% of men with a “normal” PSA can still have a lethal type of cancer\nIf abnormal, then move to 4k/PHI\nIf that’s abnormal, get an MRI\nIf abnormal, get a biopsy\n\nVicker’s analysis of percentage of people with lethal-type cancers that had a “normal” PSA reading: Evaluation of Prediagnostic Prostate-Specific Antigen Dynamics as Predictors of Death from Prostate Cancer in Patients Treated Conservatively (O’Brien et al., 2012)\nThe government loosens its guidelines on screening\n\nAround 2008, the guidelines set forth lowered the amount of doctors who consistently screened for prostate cancer\nThis change increased the incidence of cancer and metastatic cancer at first presentation\nTed wrote about this: Increasing incidence of metastatic prostate cancer in the United States (2004-2013).\n\nWhat is the screening recommendation of today?\n\n“The formal recommendation for screening for prostate cancer is: each physician and patient should discuss together. There is no formal recommendation.”\nThis worries Peter because many patients will have doctors who aren’t willing to be able to educate themselves\nI still see a lot of patients that show up and they’re not getting screened because they’re doctor’s basically saying well, obviously this is ‘controversial,’\n\nBiopsies and MRI: important things to know [1:25:30]\nWhat is a prostate biopsy? ⇒ a procedure to remove samples of suspicious tissue from the prostate to test for cancer\n\nRelatively safe now\nDramatized by anti-screeners\nTransperineal biopsies are more common\nLess common is transrectal biopsies\n\nRisks involved with biopsies\n\nBleeding after the procedure\nUsually just a small amount in a bowel movement\n1 or 2% will visit hospital with trouble urinating due to a swollen prostate\nOnly a small percentage will get an infection and need to visit the hospital (only 0.4% of Ted’s patients)\nTed’s wrote up an analysis of all the data on complications\n“In my practice I don’t biopsy everybody. I biopsy people who I think have clinically significant prostate cancer.”\n\nWhat to do before deciding on a biopsy?\n\nGet a PHI or 4K score (FYI, these tests perform equally well across demographics)\nIf abnormal, get an MRI\n\nWhat kind of MRI?\n\nYou want a multiparametric prostate MRI\nThe most important parameter in the multiparametric MRI is actually the diffusion weighted imaging\nThis is the most operator dependent, so it really requires a skilled technician and a skilled interpreter radiologist to look at those DWI images\n\n“So if you’re listening to that, and if your doctor refuses that, I think those are the kinds of things that make me think you need another doctor.”\nMultinational prospective clinical trial looking at the utility of MRI to use for screening for prostate cancer which increased detection of high-grade cancer and reduced the over-detection of low grade cancer: Role of mpMRI of the prostate in screening for prostate cancer (Wallis et al., 2017)\nWhat kind of biopsy is needed?\n\nIf there’s an abnormality on the MRI, Ted will recommend a biopsy\nYou shouldn’t just sample the suspicious lesion\nYou should do the suspicious lesion plus doing a sextant biopsy\n\nPutting all the screening together\n\nIf the PHI and 4k tests are abnormal, Ted will do a multiparametric prostate MRI\nIf MRI looks abnormal, he will recommend a sextant biopsy\nBut, 20% of the time, the MRI is a false negative\nSo in the case of a negative MRI, he then looks more closely at the PSA density\nIf PSA density if high, he will recommend a biopsy\nBut if they have an MRI, no lesion, and a low PSA density, they don’t need a biopsy\n\n“We have great tools that are building off of this very simple PSA blood test to offer people very sophisticated screening for their prostate cancer.”\nWhy urology is such a great field of medicine, and why Peter wants a goat [1:34:45]\n\nMatt McCormick, urologist in Reno\nPatients are so appreciative\nFunny profession (dick jokes)\nTed adds that in urology you “own the diagnosis” unlike other fields\n\nGoats\n\nPeter wants goats\nTed says get a pygmy goat (actually get 2)\n\n\nFigure 2. Baby pygmy goat.

    "content": "\nBen is now an advocated for the importance of screening and treating prostate cancer\n\nBen and Ted on the Howard Stern show:\n\nAlso, see Ben and Ted on TODAY show: Ben Stiller Opens Up About Prostate Cancer For First Time Since Diagnosis | TODAY\nGleason grading system [1:43:45]\nThe Gleason grading system is a way to measure the aggressiveness of a cancer when looking at samples from a biopsy\nIn the beginning, you would get a Gleason sum: \n\nWhat’s the score of most prevalent abnormality on the view of the tumor (rated 1-5)\nWhat’s the score of the second most common, kind of glandular architecture (rated 1-5)\nYou add those two scores together to get the Gleason sum\n\nNow, it’s evolved to the Gleason grade group:\n\nThere are some subtle differences in the Gleason sum that actually have real big differences for what the patient’s outcomes would be\nIn 2014/2015, a better way to transmit this Gleason information to patients and to internits in a way they can understand was created\n\nGrade group groups\n\nGoes between 1 and 5\nThe original old-school Gleason sum of six, that’s a 1.\nA Gleason sum of 3 plus 4 equals 7 is a 2.\nA sum of 4 plus 3 equals 7 is a 3.\nA 4 plus 4 = 8 is now a 4.\nA 4 plus 5 equals 9 is now a 5.\nA 5 plus 5 equals 10 is now a 5.\nSo this step wise gradation into five bins of aggressiveness called the grade group actually translates very nicely into clinical outcomes\n\nDoes Ted use genetic testing?\n\nNot generally\nDon’t do any testing if the results want matter or change what we recommend\nPSA density performs just as well as genetic testing in most cases\n\nAfter you know the Gleason grade, does anything before that matter?\n\nYes, it all is still relevant (4k score, PSA numbers, MRI, etc.)\nPeter: “So this is the ultimate Bayesian experience.” ⇒ see Peter’s email discussing Bayesian statistics\nPeter calls Ted’s approach with patients “next-level judgement”\n\nTestosterone, DHT and the prostate cancer controversy [1:53:15]\n5-alpha-reductase inhibitors\n\nMen make a hormone called testosterone\nTestosterone is converted via and enzyme called 5-alpha reductase into a very similar molecule called dihydrotestosterone (DHT)\nDHT is more potent than testosterone\nDHT drives hair loss and enlarges the prostate\n\nMedication (5-alpha-reductase inhibitors) used to reduce DHT: \n\nProscar (finasteride) at five milligrams is taken to reduce prostate size\nPropecia (finasteride) is one milligram is taken to reduce hair loss\n\nRelationship between 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and prostate cancer\nThe Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial\n\nThis trial showed that lowering DHT could reduce the risk of prostate cancer\nBut one of the problems was that there was increased detection of more aggressive cancers in men taking the drug to lower DHT\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nA) Is it inducing high grade cancer? \nB) Or is it selecting for it because any cancer that comes out of low DHT environment must be strong? ⇒ This is what Peter and Ted believe\n\nCollaboration with GenomeDx\n\nTed collaborated with Elai Davicioni and his company, GenomeDx, to look at the biology of prostate cancers, how aggressive they were, and compare the aggressiveness of the prostate cancer with the androgen output of the tumor\nHypothesis: the tumors that had the most amped up androgen signaling, the most androgen output, because prostate cancer’s a androgen-driven tumor, that they would be the most aggressive. \nThe answer: It is the opposite ⇒ The high androgen output tumors can be aggressive, however, they are not as aggressive as the ultra low ones. So it’s a bimodal distribution. \n\nThe Decipher Test\n\nGenomeDx product that’s very good at telling the aggressiveness of prostate cancer\nAlmost like a genomic Gleason score\n\nLow androgen tumors vs high androgen tumors\n“We’ve been able to take all this [GenomeDx] data, and we’ve been able to show that these low androgen output tumors are the most aggressive tumors.”\n\nUsing the GenomeDx data\nTed has shown that these low androgen output tumors are the most aggressive tumors\nVery high androgen tumors are also aggressive, but they’re exquisitely sensitive to androgen deprivation, which is one of the mainstays of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer\nLow androgen output tumors are not because they are not dependent on it for fuel\n“However, we’ve been able to model other compounds that they are sensitive to, and so we’re moving those things into clinical trials. It’s actually pretty exciting times.”\n\nSo. . .does testosterone replacement therapy cause prostate cancer?\n“I don’t see any clear evidence that physiologic replacement of testosterone is going to accelerate or cause a cancer to develop.”\nWhat about estradiol?\n\nSome have argued that as estradiol is going up, that may be playing a greater role in prostate cancer\nTed says it is unclear\nHard to know if it is causal or just associated\n\nThe metabolism of the prostate [2:03:00]\nDo the mitochondria in the prostate cancer follow the Warburg effect?\nIn other words, do they favor anaerobic metabolism over oxidative phosphorylation?\n\n“We don’t know a lot about the metabolic environment of the prostate”\nDavid Guis is making progress in this space \nHe has a lot of really interesting data looking at the sirtuin pathways through mitochondria regulating the hormonal dependency or hormonal regulation of prostate cancer.\nHe has a SIRT3 manganese superoxide dismutase pathway worked out and it regulates resistance to Tamoxifen and luminal B breast cancer\nSo it could be up-regulating or down-regulating androgen production basically.\n\n“I do think that there’s something about metabolism in the prostate. I think it’s hard to study. . .You cannot model in a mouse. I do think that there are some good people on campus here who think about it and are gonna be able to study it.”\nThe most exciting areas of research in prostate cancer [2:08:00]\n\nThe most exciting stuff in urologic oncology is really moving beyond these prognostic biomarkers to predictive biomarkers you can pick up in the DNA of a tumor or the DNA of a patient ⇒ Particularly BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM loss . . . “these different kinds of DNA damage repair pathways that people didn’t really think matter for prostate, we now know within the last three years that they really matter.”\n\n⇒ Pete Nelson paper showing that about 11 to 12% of men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer had mutations, particularly BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM, RAD51: Recent advances in prostate cancer research: large-scale genomic analyses reveal novel driver mutations and DNA repair defects (Frank et al., 2018)\n\n“If you look in the tumors of men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, depending on where you look, over one third of the tumors, the cells will have mutations in these pathways, which makes them incredibly sensitive to PARP inhibition, so that’s a huge game changer.”\n“Also, the total genomic score, or the alterations in the genome of the individual cancer cells, and will that make them more sensitive to immunotherapy or not? That’s more coming online, but the idea that there are things in the somatic DNA of the tumor cells and in the germline of individuals that you can use to screen for not only prostate, but breast, pancreas, etc, that’s a huge game changer.”\n“Then I think Eli’s test, which has a lot of these built in biomarkers that predict response to drugs that now are being tested in clinical trials, with the idea that let’s test the ability to predict response, is pretty amazing stuff actually.”\n\nBenign issues involving the prostate: pelvic pain, infections and treatments [2:11:15]\nChronic pelvic pain\n\nThis broad term covers common conditions like \n\nNonbacterial prostatitis (inflammation in prostate, no infection)\nInterstitial cystitis \n\n\n\nProstatitis: Peter tells a personal story\n\nPeter had severe burning while peeing\nNot a UTI\nCalled Ted, agreed it could be prostatitis\nTed’s dad’s paper\nProstatitis can be caused by an infection, or just inflammation\nTed suspected inflammation\nBefore taking antibiotics, Ted said go and get a prostate massage so we can check the fluids for infection\nPeter said 3 days after massage, he felt great, never took antibiotics\nPeter said the massage was extremely painful, here’s how he felt:\n\n\n\nSo what Peter had was nonbacterial prostatitis (inflammation in the prostate)\nThis falls into the bucket of “chronic pelvic pain” \nNot so sure what causes it other than constipation\n\nInterstitial cystitis \n\nBotox in the bladder as a treatment? ⇒ No, we use Botox in the bladder for people who have hypercontractility of the bladder, but we don’t use it for people who have interstitial cystitis\n\nDeep-seated infections in their prostate \n\nYou can actually directly inject antibiotics into the prostate\nThe typical nidus for this persistent infection is actually the seminal vesicle, which is attached to the prostate\nSo they will to a transrectal injection directly into the seminal vesicle\n\nVideo of Ted’s surgeries, the latest technology, and males contraceptive options [2:18:00]\nRobot surgery ⇒ All of Ted’s surgeries are now with the help of a robot\nWatch Ted perform a robotic prostatectomy:\n\nFull list of Ted’s surgery videos: Click here\nWhich is better robot or open?\n\nRobot is more precise in Ted’s opinion\nDr. Walsh Compares Open and Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Operations\n\nMale contraceptives\n\nAnything coming soon outside of a vasectomy? \nSome stuff that can block testosterone in the testicle, some coming soon\n\nVasectomies\n\nSafe procedure for sure (maybe freeze some sperm first)\nEasy to reverse? ⇒ Over 90% are reversible with a good procedure\n\nWatches and cars [2:23:30]\nWatches\n\nTed was wearing the “beautiful Hulk” during the podcast interview\nPeter’s obsessed with 2 Vacheron watches: The Ultra Thin, and the 1921\n\n\nFigure 3.
