Plus the fact that science had not been able to crack this nut, it was one of the last great remaining scientific mysteries.”\nSleep and Alzheimer’s disease, and the 4 pillars of sleep [11:15]\n\nWalker was studying the brainwave patterns in people with dementia but not getting anywhere\nNoticed that different pathologies hit sleep centers, others spared until late in process\nNeeded to measure patients while sleeping, not aware: then results took off\n\nCould sleep disruption be a biomarker of dementia, or even an underlying cause?\n“Based on the weight of the data that we have, the evidence, I think it is causal. I think that sleep, at this stage, may be one of the most significant lifestyle factors that determines your risk ratio for Alzheimer’s disease. I feel the causal evidence for that now in humans and animals is strong enough to make that statement. And I don’t make that statement lightly.”\nCould poor sleep lead to neuronal energy deprivation (like vascular disease and insulin resistance)?\n\nSleep impacts oxidative stress\nFrom Matthew’s book: “Wakefulness is low level brain damage” and “sleep is the price we pay for wakefulness”\n\nIt’s a tenable hypothesis that evolutionarily, sleep may have been the default state ⇒ “Perhaps the default state of life on the planet was sleep, and it was from sleep that wakefulness emerged.”\n\n\n\nAlzheimer’s disease\n\nThe first thing is that we see that within insufficient sleep, you get increases in oxidative stress and that leads to a whole cascade of things that lead to neuronal death\nHippocampus (memory) 1st damaged in Alzheimer’s (forgetfulness)\n\n⇒ Remarkable discovery: In 2012, Rochester University team found that brain has “sewage” system (glymphatic system, glial cells) similar to lymphatic system\n\nSanitation system that kicks in when in deep sleep and glial cells shrink up to 200% in size make room for cerebral spinal fluid fill brain and wash out “metabolic detritus” of wakefulness\n\n\nFigure 1. Schematic depiction of the glymphatic pathway. In this brain-wide pathway, CSF enters the brain along para-arterial routes, whereas ISF is cleared from the brain along paravenous routes. Convective bulk ISF flow between these influx and clearance routes is facilitated by AQP4-dependent astroglial water flux and drives the clearance of interstitial solutes and fluid from the brain parenchyma. From here, solutes and fluid may be dispersed into the subarachnoid CSF, enter the bloodstream across the postcapillary vasculature, or follow the walls of the draining veins to reach the cervical lymphatics.

You just decided that you’re going to sleep half of what is evolutionarily programmed? … Does it strike you as odd that evolution would have designed us to spend a third of our life, not mating, not watching out for predators, not hunting for food, but doing this thing for some other purpose? Do you think that thing must have been important?”\nOvernight it changed the way Peter thought about sleep, which was that evolution went to great lengths to do this\n\n“Sleep is the greatest life support system you could ever wish for. It’s a remarkable health insurance policy, it’s largely democratic, free and largely painless.”\nSleep is the foundation of health\n\nIn terms of de-risking just about every disease that is killing us in the developed world, it’s very hard to look no further than sleep\nNutrition and exercise are important, but sleep in the foundation\n“Sleep is the foundation on which those two other things sit. It’s not the third pillar of good health, I think it is the foundation.”\n\n⇒ How long can you survive without sleep?\n\nThe record someone survived without food might be 382 days (lean person maybe 30 days) \nDeprivation of sleep causes the quickest reduction of health\nGuinness has banned trying to set record for sleep deprivation (record might have been up to 24 days) because it’s so dangerous (cancer, mental health, CVD, metabolic syndrome, suicidality).\nThink about this: \n\nFelix Baumgartner went up in hot air balloon to outer surface of Earth and then jumped out, fell over 1000/km/hr, broke sound barrier\nThat was NOT banned by Guinness, but sleep deprivation was – gives you sense of how dangerous it is not to sleep\n\n\n\nThe early riser vs. the night owl, and tips for overcoming jet lag [1:09:15]\nWhat is different about 2 people who both only sleep for 6 hours, but one person from 9 pm – 3 am and the other midnight to 6 am?\n\nYour brain has different taste sensitivities to non-REM and REM across the 24-hour clock face \n9 pm – 3 am, you are mostly in deep non-REM\n3 am – midday, would be mostly REM sleep\nEarly to bed and early to rise and sleeping only 6 hours, it means you’re losing mostly REM\n\nJet lag and changing time zones:\n\nExample, if flying from California to London… \n\nWake up 10 min earlier for 5 days before, then very early on flight day\nSleep on first half of flight (not second as many people do) to line up what the people are doing in London\nBuild up “sleep pressure” so can sleep when night in London (the longer you are awake, the more you will build up sleep pressure)\n\n\nIn example above, type of sleep you get will not be the same ⇒ if move your window of sleep to earlier in the day (short changing REM sleep) or to later in the night (short changing deep non-REM)\n\nPeter’s observations of sleep when flip flopping between CA and NY\n\nWhen in NY: Trying to stay on CA time ⇒ Going to bed later, waking up later\nWhen in CA: very early sleeper and an early riser\nTries to stick to 8 hours\n\nCan do that very well in California\nNot as well in New York\n\n\nFirst night back in California, he has much higher amount of deep sleep\n\n“And that would explain it.

So REM sleep selectively removed, the rats died basically almost as quickly as they did from total sleep deprivation.”\nNon-REM deprivation took longer to be fatal (about 20 days)\n\nWhen did the different sleep stages evolve?\n\n“What I find either strange or exciting about that is, if you look from an evolutionary standpoint, those two types of sleep did not emerge at the same time.”\nTrue REM is seen only in birds and mammals\nNo true REM sleep in reptiles, fish, insects, amphibians\nTwo different evolutionary paths: \n\nNon-REM sleep appears in almost all species\nAnd REM sleep developed twice, independently, once in birds and once in mammals\n\n\n\nWhy do we die soon from REM deprivation?\n\nBirds and mammals evolved neuronally and therefore probably requires something essential in REM and when you deprive REM you affect the “superpower” (the cortex)\nAnything that has a complex nervous system, maybe that’s where the pressure for this thing called REM sleep emerged, says Matthew\n\nImportance of REM sleep ⇒ We need to worry about both deep and REM sleep, but REM is arguably even more important (and alcohol affects REM sleep)\nThe dangers of drowsy driving [1:25:45]\nSleep has been stigmatized as laziness\n\nMargaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan famously proclaimed the uselessness of sleep\nSleep is for the weak, sleep when you’re dead, etc.\nWould proudly say they only hot 4-5 hours of sleep a night\n“I don’t think it’s coincidental now looking back, that both of them went onto to develop Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nThe first big reason why lack of sleep is frightening? ⇒ Chronic diseases (like Alzheimer’s)\nThe second big reason? ⇒ deadly car crashes\n\n“People with responsibility or authority should not glorify lack of sleep.”\n“In the hour that we’ve been talking already, numerous people have lost their life in a drowsy-driving related accident, based on the statistics.” \n\n\nFigure 4.
