The leaner you are, building becomes more important.” —Peter Attia\nImportance of getting enough protein in the context of fasting/building muscle\nNick asks Peter: A lot of times people interchange the word fasting with other things. So when you said earlier you went to an excess fasting regimen, what is that? Are you talking 12 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours? How do you think about that?\n\nwe really don’t know what’s long and what’s short for a fast, but we do know the extremes\n\nFor instance, we know 12 hours is not a fast and we know that five days is a fast\n\n\nDoes one meal a day constitute fasting? ⇒ “I don’t think so”\n\nThe problem with one meal a day for most people, if they’re trying to put on muscle mass, it’s pretty darn hard to eat two grams per kilo of protein in one sitting\nOMADs and things like that are generally going to come at the expense of muscle mass—Not because muscle protein synthesis can’t take place if you’re smart about where you target and time your exercise, but because I simply think most people are protein deficient when they do it\nit becomes a bit of a protein sparing diet\nAgain, OMAD is a great idea if you’re overweight and insulin resistant, not a great idea if you’re lean.\n\n\n",
