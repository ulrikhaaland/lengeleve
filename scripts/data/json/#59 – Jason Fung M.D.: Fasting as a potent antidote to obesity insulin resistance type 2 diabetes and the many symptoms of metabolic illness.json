Doesn’t mean that they’re wrong, but I’m generally suspect because of that.”\nBiology is harder than physics…. it’s just a lot messier\nPeter: “Every time I think I’ve really got it figured out, I’ll always meet a patient who proves me wrong.”\n\nWhat Jason appreciates most about physics\n\nMany great theories (e.g., Newton)\nBut then inevitably there are anomalies ⇒ “Anomalies are what drives sort of science forward because you have to come up with a better theory that explains the anomalies”\nThen you come up with a better theory which may have wild predictions but it could supplant the existing theory (i.e. Niels Bohr’s quantum theory supplanted Einstein)\nThis doesn’t happen in medicine, says Jason… instead we have a super laborious process of evidence-based medicine\n\nThe limitations of evidence-based medicine [12:30]\nJason explains his frustrations…\n\nIn medicine, we have a super laborious process\nWe need evidence in order to move things forward\nWhereas physics moves at “light speed” because it doesn’t demand the sort of evidence base\nEvidence-based medicine is not a search for truth… it’s a search for consensus\nThis approach makes things move glacially\n\n⇒ For example, fasting…\n\nFive years ago, fasting was the dumbest thing you could do\nBut Jason treated hundreds and hundreds of patients, and the “results were amazing”",

You can’t make intuitive leaps forward. That always bothers me a lot.”\nTheorists vs. experimentalists\n\nIn physics, you can generally divide the field into the experimentalists and the theorists\nThat’s what I think allows the step-function changes in our understanding, says Peter\nEinstein’s advances were theoretical, for example, and the experimental evidence to support these things came after \nAnd many times the big steps forward come on the basis of theoretical propositions\n“We don’t really have that medicine and biology. We don’t have experimentalists and theorists.”\n\nWhere evidence-based medicine works\n⇒ Best example of evidence-based medicine working: infectious disease\n\nThe treatment most infections is remarkable (e.g., HIV)\n\nInfections are quite acute, very easy and binary to measure progression\nThe interventions are simple (i.e., take this medication/don’t take this medication)\nYou get the answer if it’s working really quickly (looking at T-cell count or amelioration)\n\n\n\n⇒ The problem is that most things in medicine are much more complicated than this\n“I think evidence-informed medicine is probably a better way to think about it.” says Peter\nThe risk of doing nothing\n\nPeople are very quick to say, for instance, “Well, you don’t have the evidence to support fasting for a patient with Type II Diabetes.” \nBut… what’s the risk of NOT doing something? \n*You must compare the risk of doing something (much more on the forefront of people’s minds) with the risk of NOT doing something (which people often forget to consider)*\n\n⇒ For example, people with Type 2 diabetes\n\nRisk of NOT doing anything:\n\nContinue to get treated with more and more insulin to control blood glucose\nIt’s a virtual certainty that they will eventually have to go on dialysis\nSo the risk of doing nothing is huge compared to the risk of an intervention like fasting\n\n\n\nEarly signs of metabolic disease: How specializing kidney disease gives Jason a unique insight into early indications of illness [20:50]\nNephrology is a specialty of medicine that concerns itself with the kidneys: the study of normal kidney function and kidney disease, the preservation of kidney health, and the treatment of kidney disease, from diet and medication to renal replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation) [wikipedia.org]\nWhy did Jason choose nephrology?\n\nHe was drawn to internal medicine because generally it attracts people who “sort of like to think about things and try to solve puzzles”\nAnd within nephrology, a subdivision of internal medicine, all you can do is think about things “because that’s all we could do”\nExample, with kidney disease, there are two general treatments:\n\n1 Prednisone\n2 Dialysis\n\n\n“The last time we had a drug that actually slowed down progression of kidney disease was the ACE inhibitors in the 80s.”\nMore recently, we have the SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetic kidney disease\n“Before that, it’s like nothing. There wasn’t a lot to do, but there’s a lot to think about. That’s sort of what I liked about.”\n\nPeter is impressed with 2 things about the kidney:\nFirst, how intelligent it is\n\nThere was a very clever design in evolution \nThe kidney pulls out everything and then dumps out the bad, and keeps what is good… because the probability that the good things are going to change is low, but the probability that you’ll see new bad things is high\nSock drawer analogy: It would be tempting to think that the kidney would operate like it’s going in your sock drawer to pull out just the right sock, but it doesn’t, it pulls out all of the socks and puts back the right ones.\n\nSecondly, how small the kidney compared to how much it does\n\nA very high fraction of our circulating blood volume passes through the kidney (about 20%)\nThis is part of the reason that the kidney is such an early warning indicator of disease either through high blood pressure or high glucose\n\nThe kidney as an early warning indicator of high blood pressure and high glucose\n",

They are compromised. It won’t be clinically relevant for 30 or 40 years, but that is going to be relevant.’”\n\nThere are no symptoms of kidney disease\n\nThe thing is that there are no symptoms\nIgA Nephritis is the most common primary kidney disease in the world\nBut the patient will not know it\n“They will have lost 95% of their kidney function by the time I see them just because they never knew they had a problem because they never checked it.” \nFortunately, it’s so easy check in the urine, it’s non-invasive, and anybody can do it\n\nInsulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and the overflow paradigm [29:30]\nExplaining insulin resistance to a layperson\n\nTo start, Jason says the way he was taught insulin resistance in med school was wrong because it was only in terms of glucose\n\n⇒ The wrong way to think about it…\n\nInsulin is a hormone, and when insulin goes up, it allows glucose (through the GLUT4 receptor) to go from the blood into the cells\nIn the case of normal levels of insulin (unlike type 1 diabetes), and glucose can’t make it into the cells, we call it “insulin resistance” \nSo if insulin is around, why can’t the glucose go into the cell? ⇒ It must be because of insulin resistance\n\n⇒ This is the lock and key paradigm\n\nInsulin is a hormone. It acts on the insulin receptor, which is on the cell surface. \nThe insulin receptor is like a gate ⇒ There’s a door with a lock ⇒ Insulin is like the key so it opens the door ⇒ Therefore, the glucose can go from the blood into the cell for energy\nWhen you look at insulin and insulin receptors and see there is nothing wrong with them, the common thinking is that there must be something that’s gumming up the system",

That’s not really possible.”\n⇒ Obesity…\n\nA very common phenotype of insulin resistance is obesity (i.e., the accumulation of fat in a fat cell)\nFor a fat cell to get larger, it needs to incorporate triglyceride\nTo incorporate triglyceride requires insulin\nSo, on the one hand, this patient is insulin resistant… but looking the fat cell, it appears to be quite well insensitive to insulin\n\nHyperinsulinemia\n\nThe problem is not insulin resistance per se, the problem is hyperinsulinemia\nUsing insulin to push more and more glucose into the cells is a problem because the cell is already too full in a person with insulin resistance/T2D\n\n⇒ The suitcase analogy\n\nYou are packing a suitcase\nYour wife tells you to put more shirts in, so you do\nBut after she keeps asking you to put shirts in, you finally say “no”\nPossible reasons you say “no”\nThe suitcase won’t open anymore so you can’t add shirts\nIt’s too full to add more\nYou simply decided to stop listening to her\nBut whether you are fully willing to add shirts, or if you are defiant to her request, the outcome looks the exact same… excess shirts outside the suitcase\n\n⇒ In the case that you’re being stubborn and simply not listening to your wife… \n\nWhen we treat type 2 diabetes with big doses of exogenous insulin, we are essentially ramming the excess shirts (glucose) into the suitcase (cell) \n\n⇒ But if it’s an overflow paradigm, the implication is completely different…\n\nBecause the solution is to get rid of some of the stuff that’s in your suitcase\nPutting more in is not the solution\nThe solution is to empty that cell of glucose… that’s the whole solution\nBut that is a totally different paradigm than what we’ve been taught… we use sulfonylureas and exogenous insulin trying to shove more glucose into this already filled cell\n\nHigh insulin environment\nIncreasing insulin to deal with the excess glucose because of so-called “insulin resistance” actually supercharges the other effects of insulin on the body\n\nIt triggers the making of testosterone\nYou get PCOS\nThe growth effects of insulin which has huge implications for cancer\nExample, breast cancer and colon cancer \n\nVery insulin sensitive\nMuch higher rates in type 2 diabetes and obesity\nSo, you’re getting the cancer-causing effects of the insulin, but yet you’re saying people are insulin resistant\n\n\nSo it makes sense that you have continued de novo lipogenesis even in the face of this so-called resistance, because you actually have too much insulin\n\nWhy the common treatments for type 2 diabetes seem to make things worse [42:30]",

[1:12:15]\nJason says the following are not actually detrimental, they’re actually protective\n\nObesity\nInsulin resistance\nFatty pancreas\n\nFor example, let’s take obesity…\n\nSuppose you live in a house on a street\nEvery day, insulin comes by and knocks on the door and gives you a little bit of glucose\nYou say thank you and you use it for energy and everything’s great\nThen one day, insulin comes by and instead of giving you a little cup of glucose, it gives you a big barrel of glucose\nIt’s sort of too much but you take it because you’re supposed to… but eventually your house fills up with all this glucose\n\n⇒ So what are you going to do? \n\nYou’re going to stop taking that glucose (so that’s insulin resistance)\nIt’s protecting itself from the effects of too much glucose\nWith fatty liver ⇒ it’s protecting itself from too much glucose\nInsulin, however, is still thinking “I’ve got to get rid of this glucose. I can’t have it hanging around, I’m going to lose my job.”\nSo more and more insulin comes to your house and starts battering down the door and just shoving in all this glucose\nThe insulin is overcoming the protective response (insulin resistance) \n\n⇒ So then what do you do? \n\nWell, you start to take some of these barrels of glucose and you try and give it to your friends and your family (this is what the liver does)\nIt’s got way too much fat sitting around so it takes this fat and shovels it out the door as VLDL\nIt goes into other organs\n\nThe omentum ⇒ That’s how you get abdominal obesity that you see\nThe pancreas ⇒ fatty pancreas\n\n\n\n⇒ Fatty pancreas\n\nYour pancreas makes a lot of insulin, makes a lot of insulin, makes a lot of insulin up onto a certain point until it’s all clogged up and it can’t make the insulin\nSo what happens? … You start to pee out all this sugar… you get polyuria, polydipsia, glycosuria, your body is actually trying to protect itself by peeing out all this sugar\n\n“We think of all these responses, obesity, insulin resistance, and the beta cell failure, as pathologic, but they’re actually protective. . .Your body is actually trying to protect yourself against the root cause of the problem which is too much insulin, too much glucose.”\nSGLT2s\n\nThey are effective because they attack the root cause\n\nTreatment with insulin\n\nWhen you actually give people more insulin, you actually keep all that glucose inside\nAnd guess what?

These people with the lipodystrophy, they couldn’t store the fat so what happens is the fat stored up in their liver and they had the highest insulin resistance you’ve ever measured, because it’s really a protective mechanism. The fat is trying to suck away all this glucose so that it doesn’t cause a problem.”.\nObesity as a protective mechanism\nThis is why obesity itself is actually a protective mechanism against hyperinsulinemia, against too much sugar. \nThe ultimate problem is too much glucose and too much insulin. \nThen the next step is okay, so now insulin is way too much. \nInsulin has got all his cousins out battering down your door, throwing in all this stuff and you can’t take it anymore. \nIs obesity causing insulin resistance or is it the other way around? [1:17:30]\nWhich is driving which?\n\n“I think it’s more likely that hyperinsulinemia is driving the obesity rather than the other way around.”\n\n1993 insulin study\n\nTook people who were type 2 diabetic\nThey gave them a lot of insulin, so from time zero to six months, they went from zero units of insulin to like 100 units of insulin. \nTheir blood sugars were great\nWhat happened? … Well, they gained like 20 pounds and if you look at the number of calories they were eating per day, it actually had dropped by about 200 or 300 calories per day\nThe only difference was the hyperinsulinemia\n\n“The arrow of causality is very easy to establish going from hyperinsulinemia to obesity, and forgetting all the mechanism.”\n⇒ Study showing liposuction didn’t improve insulin resistance or risk factors for CVD\n\nLiposuction doesn’t reverse insulin resistance\nHowever, that procedure doesn’t remove visceral fat which might be the fat that is causing the major problems\n\nWhat role does inflammation play in obesity? [1:21:45]\nThe other thing that seems to go hand in hand with hyperinsulinemia in patients is they also tend to be quite inflamed (measured via C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, interleukins, cardiac specific forms of inflammation, etc.)\nJason’s take:\n\nAnti-inflammatory medicine doesn’t seem to help people lose weight consistently\n\nSuch as NSAIDs, Prednisone, etc. \n\n\nSo, there might be a kernel of truth in that, but it doesn’t really make a lot of sense\nAlso, in the case of a bad infection causing inflammation to rise up… People don’t gain a bunch of weight\n\n“I don’t deny that there’s a lot of important inflammatory mediators and stuff, but it’s just not so simple that you can say more inflammation causes weight gain, less inflammation causes weight loss.”\nPeter’s observation with his patients\n\nPatients that come to him needing to lose weight\nA hyperinsulinemic patient with no inflammation tend to respond quite well to carbohydrate restriction and exercise\nA hyperinsulinemic patient coupled with inflammation tend to NOT respond well to carbohydrate restriction and exercise and need fasting to move the needle\n\n⇒ Does that suggest that inflammation can have a negative synergy with hyperinsulinemia?\n\nI think that there probably is something to that, says Jason",

The difference is they got pregnant and that’s a difference in sex hormones. \nLooking at girls and boys at puberty for example… \nThe difference between girls and boys is testosterone versus estrogen\nYet girls who go through puberty have way more fat than boys (who get more muscle)\n\n“So we know that there are other hormones that clearly have an impact, so it’s not just about insulin, but it’s about cortisol, it’s about sex hormones, and I think inflammation probably comes in there somewhere, but what to do about it and it’s a lot messier…too many moving parts.”\nCVD and cancer: Diseases of too much growth?

No restriction on how much you eat. You just can’t eat these foods\nExample, carb-restriction\n\n\nDepending on how well those 2 approaches work, Peter may begin to encourage patients to incorporate longer fasting\n\nAt Jason’s practice:\n\nHe focuses heavily on the fasting from the start",

Then, as soon as you need to use it, you chop up your sofa and throw it in the fire. . . I don’t think our bodies are that stupid.” \nGluconeogenesis\n\nThere’s a period, which is fairly limited, during the fast thing where you have gluconeogenesis\nThen you can see fat oxidation goes way up\nHere’s a 1969 study by George Cahill\n\n⇒ Paper by Frank Nuttall\n\nHe tried to estimate how much excess protein\nHe found that somebody who is overweight has 20 to 50% more protein than a regular person\nThat excess protein is in the form of skin, muscle, connective tissue, blood vessels\n“There’s all kinds of extra protein that goes along with being overweight and that all needs to go.”\n\nJason summarizes why is not worried about muscle loss:\n“I’ve treated a few thousands of patients with type two diabetes. . .how many patients have I had to stop because I was worried about muscle loss? That would be zero in six years. . . People rag on me all the time about this. It’s like, ‘Oh what about this? What about this?’ Okay, how many thousands of patients have you done this for? Try it on several thousand patients. Then come back to me and tell me if muscle loss is the most important thing for this 65-year-old, 300-pound man on 150 units of insulin.”\nWill fasting help a healthy person live longer? [2:31:30]\nCan a heathy person (meaning non-obese, insulin-sensitive, non hyperinsulinemic person) benefit from periodic fasting in terms of reducing the odds of chronic disease down the line?\n\n“Absolutely, yes.”\nIf you use fasting to drop your insulin levels every so often, you’re going to lower your chance of getting diseases of hyperinsulinemia (heart disease, stroke, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, type two diabetes, obesity)\n\nWhat about something like quarterly prolonged fasting (5+ days) to increase longevity?\n\nJason says if you take the perspective of evidence-based medicine, you might say that there is no evidence it can improve longevity/ward off chronic disease\nHowever… what is the risk/reward ratio?\n\nIn terms of risk, Jason says it’s “just about zero”\nIn terms of reward, it could be potentially massive\n\n\nSo the real question is… why wouldn’t you do it?\n\n⇒ For example, let’s say you have rheumatoid arthritis\n\nIf the Valter Longo’s FMD says it can help “reset” your immune system and improve your autoimmune disease… why wouldn’t you try it?\n“We know what prednisone does to people, so why wouldn’t I do seven days of fasting? The risk of that is zero. Say I don’t get any benefit from that, then I don’t have to do it ever again. What happens if things get a lot better? I’ve just treated my own disease. The reward can be so high, but you don’t have to guess that, you can just do it.”\n\nDoes fasting cause gallstones? [2:38:45]\nThere is “weak epidemiology” suggesting that skipping breakfast will increase your risk of gallstones, how often are you seeing that in your practice?\n\nA lot of people have gallstones, say Jason, “but I don’t see an increased risk” \n\nGallstones and the low fat diet\n\nThe problem is that people who follow a low fat diet seem to run into issues\nYour gallbladder uses bile to emulsify fats\nTherefore when there’s not fat in your diet the bile just sits around with all this stuff and you get sludge\nThen, you start eating a higher fat diet and you are then squeezing it out and you’re getting stones\n",

The intrahepatic flow. . . we think we’re so much smarter than our body, which has survived for millions of years. We’re going to eat zero fat and just have all this sludge just sit in the gallbladder because you never took it out. How does that make sense? To me, it makes no sense.”\n",
