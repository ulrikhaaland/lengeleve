He did postdoctoral research at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam and at the Montreal Heart Institute.  Benoît is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the Université Laval and a research scientist in the cardiology axis at the Centre de recherche de l’Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, in Canada.  ",
