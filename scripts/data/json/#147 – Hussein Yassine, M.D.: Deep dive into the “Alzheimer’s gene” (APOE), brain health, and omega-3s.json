    "content": "Hussein Yassine is a physician and researcher who studies brain lipid utilization in the context of finding preventative measures for cognitive impairment, specifically Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In my conversation with Hussein, we begin with a fundamental coursework in brain biology—including its architecture and energy systems. We go on to discuss what these systems look like when something goes wrong and cognitive decline ensues. We talk about the evolutionary origins of the ApoE genotype, with specific attention to the ApoE4 allele and its association with AD. We spend time discussing ApoE4 implications for the brain’s fuel utilization, notably omega-3 fatty acids: EPA and DHA. We briefly pivot to the implications of recent omega-3 trials for cardiovascular disease and return to what we currently understand about EPA/DHA and brain health; we contemplate potential dietary interventions across the lifespan to preserve and prolong cognitive function.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#147 - Hussein Yassine, M.D.: Deep dive into the “Alzheimer’s gene” (APOE), brain health, and omega-3s\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#147 - Hussein Yassine, M.D.: Deep dive into the “Alzheimer’s gene” (APOE), brain health, and omega-3s\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#147 - Hussein Yassine, M.D.: Deep dive into the “Alzheimer’s gene” (APOE), brain health, and omega-3s\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t",

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other. We discuss:  Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [2:45]; Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [9:45]; Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [19:45]; How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [26:30]; What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations?

[1:46:00]; The impact of stress on cancer [1:50:30]; The impact of stress on atherosclerosis, dementia, addiction, and depression [1:57:00]; Impulsiveness, impaired judgment, and lack of empathy in times of stress [2:01:45]; What advice would Robert give his 25-year-old self?

(A) Scheme of the neurovascular unit that constitutes the BBB and (B) the main routes of the crossing of molecules to the CNS are represented [source]\nCerebral spinal fluid (CSF) os the “sewage system” of the brain\n\nAllows drainage from the brain cells, from the interstitial fluid\nFluid surrounding brain cells that we call the interstitial fluid\nBy products of brain cells—protein aggregates for examples, which build up in diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are cleared by the CSF \nThe choroid plexus pumps water-like fluid into the CSF. This motion of fluid through the brain washes it \n\nInterferes with blood circulation to clear out metabolic waste from the CSF into the blood for excretion\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The CSF activity is critical for maintaining the sewage system of the brain and the choroid plexus shuttles the waste products into the blood from the brain for excretion [source]\n\nIllness makes it difficult to clear CSF\n\nPeople can be born with malformations that obstruct the flow of CSF, and they develop conditions, where some of these compartments within the brain expand and enlarge\nShunts can help drain fluid from the brain and into the abdomen \n\n\nThe brain is a bloodless organ \n\n \nLipids and brain function [13:00]\n\nThe reason the brain is so lipid-laden relative to other organs is because it is an electrical system that requires lipids\nCells of the brain require lipid and cholesterol\n\nThe brain is functionally different \n\nAn electrical system that constantly fires \nThe brain’s function is signal transduction\n",

So not only will you get cardiovascular benefit, but you will also get a brain benefit because the blood vessels in Alzheimer’s disease have as much of a role as the actual neurons and astrocytes and so forth.” — Hussein Yassine, M.D.\nHussein’s upcoming publications on older E4 carrier fuel utilization\n\nIn an older E4 brain, once dementia starts there is a failure to utilize glucose as a  source of energy and phospholipase enzymes that facilitate cellular auto-digestion are upregulated \nThe enzyme is activated in the E4 brain to possibly extract FAs for its own neuronal myelin to produce ATP\nPhospholipase A2 enzyme (PLA2) control omega-3 and omega-6 FA utilization in the brain \n\nCalcium-dependent enzyme of phospholipase A2 \nStrongly upregulated in AD disease brains who also carry the E4 genotype vs non-AD brains with carry E4 genotype \n\n\nThe analysis accessed RUSH AD disease research archive and identified PLA2 enzymes that is hyperactive in E4 brains \n\nApoE4 brain activates these enzymes which take away FAs from the phospholipid membrane and degrades the Fas for ATP \nThe effect is neuronal inflammation and oxidative stress \nNot the same patterns in non E4 carriers with AD dementia   \n\n\nHas implications for recommendations to younger E4 carriers vs older E4 carriers\n\nOnce E4 carriers have disease there is likely less benefit from ketone supplementation compared to non-carriers\n\nThe largest studies to date do not demonstrate beneficial response to supplementation once E4 carriers have disease\nThe degenerating blood brain barrier compromising the transport of ketone bodies, the same way it has compromised glucose and omega-3 FAs \nDietary interventions at this stage may not be very effective\nHighlights the importance of getting the right intervention before you get to that stage \n\n\nFigure 8. Interaction of omega-3, apoE4, disease stage in cognitive outcomes [source]\nHussein does not recommend omega-3 supplementation due to lack of evidence \n\nHe can recommend that people have at least 1 serving of fatty fish per week \nEpidemiology studies suggest that E4 carriers who consume 1 serving of fatty fish per week may be providing enough omega-3s to the brain to help mitigate disease longer-term\nThe best advice Hussein can give is to maintain adequate omega-3 consumption from fatty fish and not supplements and to control blood pressure and exercise throughout the lifespan  \n\nExercise may help mitigate cognitive decline\n\nPET imaging study reports that E4 carriers who exercise have less amyloid plaque buildup compared to E4 carriers who did not exercise \nMultiple factors including high level of education and hypertension control protected E4 carriers from dementia vs E4 carriers who had less education and worst blood pressure control\n\n",
