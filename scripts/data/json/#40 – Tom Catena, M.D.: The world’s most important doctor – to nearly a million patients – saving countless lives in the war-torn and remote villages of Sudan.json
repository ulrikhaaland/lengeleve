In terms of individual lives saved, you could argue that there is no other person on the front lines doing more than Tom. Additionally, we explore the manner in which the Nuba people die, which is in striking contrast to the ubiquity of chronic disease and self-harm in the west, despite the extreme poverty and unimaginable suffering experienced by the Nuba people. Lastly, we discuss the lessons to be gleaned from the Nuba people, who despite their suffering, live so harmoniously, happily, and resiliently.

There’s no way I can in good conscience leave this place, and go out. It was a very, very stark reality. And to be honest with you, it was not a difficult decision.” \n“Let’s just stick it out, we’re here as missionaries, let’s do what we’re supposed to do and take care of the people as best we can. And come what may. We have faith in God. We’ll see what happens.”\nThat said, he does not hold it against the others that left\n\nAfter the staff left:\n\nBiggest problem was anesthesiology for surgery\nThe morning that the staff left, there was a bombing by the North Sudan’s air force\nYou can hear the sounds of the Antonov planes in the film Heart of Nuba\nMangled bodies start rolling in\nHuge shards of metal tore through people creating massive tissue loss and trauma\n\nGirl needing arm amputated\n\nFirst case after staff evacuated\nGirl came in needing her arm amputated\nNeither Tom, nor the nurses knew how to do general anesthesia \nThey literally read a basic anesthesia book that listed it out step by step\nTom had to intubate the patient, which can kill them if done wrong, something Tom had never done before\nBy the grace of God, got the patient intubated\nThen someone had to manually ventilate the patient throughout the entire surgery\nAll they had was an Oxford Miniature Ventilator\n\nPeter is flabbergasted and goes on a brief rant\n\nThey were without an anesthetist for 2 months",

I would overdo it or under do it. There’s no way you’d hit that sweet spot.”\n\nIntussusception in a baby\n\nNine month old baby\nintussusception is when the intestine telescopes on itself and basically causes a blockage of the intestine\nThe longer you delay, that intestine can die and the person will die from infection\n“We made the diagnosis and I’m just like, ‘Oh God, what are we supposed to do with this kid?’”\nBut managed to get baby intubated\nDid a bowel resection \nAnd now he’s nine years old, “he’s cruising”\n\nWhat other kinds of injuries occur when shrapnel is going through people?\n\nLiver lacerations, bowel injuries, hemopneumothorax, head trauma, kidney trauma, etc.\nWhy do you have so many extremity traumas? ⇒ “Because they’re the ones who actually survive”\nOne guy has 23 holes in his intestines that “we had to resect here, resect there, stitch this one… just took forever”\n\n\nFigure 2.

But you can’t then fail to acknowledge the times when, in the name of religion, people are doing these incredible things.”\nHow did Nick Kristof learn about Tom?\n\nAlways had an interest in Sudan after seeing what al-Bashir was doing to the people\nHe made a couple of trips into the Nuba mountains\nTo get there…\nYou can fly into Juba\nThen take a flight up to the refugee camp in Yida\nAnd then, you can manage to come into Nuba mountains\nYou don’t come in with official permission of the Sudan government\nHe just has an interest in that part of the world and really wanted to do something that shed light on the situation there, against Bashir\nHe had been to Nuba, I think, one previous time and heard about the hospital, wanted to come see us there and see what kind of work we were doing, to see for himself, and was there for a few days. He’s a really intrepid traveler, an incredible journalist.\n“What I respect about him the most is he can disagree with you, whatever, religiously, politically not agree with your beliefs, but he could realize what you’re doing has benefit, and he can look at it objectively and say okay, I don’t believe in this religion, but I see what these guys are doing, and highlight that. Not many people are willing to do that.”\n“Certainly the Nuba Mountains are a better place because of Nicholas’s work.”\n\nTom’s work with the Aurora Prize organization\n“Aurora’s focus is on highlighting what they say is unsung heroes, but people that are kind of operating in the weeds, that nobody knows about. So shine a bit of spotlight on them, not so much for publicity, but to help them both in their work, and by raising their profile you raise the issues that they’re involved with.”\nTom won the 2017 Aurora Prize for his work in Nuba: DR. TOM CATENA – 2017 AURORA PRIZE LAUREATE\nHere’s the video made for Tom as an Aurora Prize finalist: 2016 Aurora Prize Finalist, Dr. Tom Catena: Courage You Would Never Expect\nThe Aurora Prize gives away 1 million dollars yearly to people doing humanitarian work and allows them to elect which charity that money goes towards (although it’s a finite time period of 8 years so it ends in 2023)\nTom now works with Aurora as a chairman of the organization\n⇒ “But I thought maybe using Aurora as a vehicle, it was time to come out, to kind of see what was out there, and to try to expand the model that we have in the Nuba Mountains. So to find a way to bridge the gap between big donors … and small organizations, people on the ground that are doing a lot of the grassroots work and doing it very efficiently.”\nMoney goes a LONG way in Africa\nAt Tom’s hospital, for example…\n⇒ For 1 million dollars:\n\nCould see 130,000 outpatients\ndo close to 2,000 operations\n6,000 inpatients\nvaccinate tens of thousands of children\nseveral thousand maternity patients for that\n\n“If someone gave us a million bucks, we could easily run the hospital for a year and probably expand quite a bit what we’re already doing.”\nBiggest problem is logistics of getting the supplies\n\nThe #1 challenge is logistics\nSupplies have to come from Nairobi which is 2 countries away\nFirst goest through Uganda, up to the border with South Sudan where they just harass the heck out of the drivers",

It’s totally impossible.”\n\nShe’s got a huge spleen that hurts, she’s anemic\nAnd she’s got a bunch of kids\nShe walks for days to each time she visits the hospital despite her condition\nOnly a small amount of Gleevec would get her through the year\nShe is one of only a few people with CML so they really don’t need much\n\nThe logistical challenge of helping Tom’s hospital, and what Tom really needs [1:39:15]\nHow would someone even logistically go about providing specific or project-based funding to your mission?\nFirst step is to contact the Catholic Medical Mission Board (CMMB) ⇒ For example, if someone were to send Gleevec to CMMB, and they could find a way to get it to Juba, then they might be able to find a way to get it to Tom in Nuba\nMoney is half the battle, the other half is logistics\n⇒ The logistics problem can be summed up as follows: \n\nThere’s a problem with access to the remote area of Nuba\nGetting through the administrative things you have to do to get some funding and supplies from the big organization that have money to disperse to charity causes\n\nWhat Tom really needs is people\n\nIt’s a daunting task trying to apply to in these big organizations and to just get through that application process to get funds\nThen once you get the funds, you have to account for it and do monitoring and evaluation and follow-up\nTom needs people who are trained in this area of writing proposals and monitoring and evaluation and all this sort of stuff to really follow through with all this\n\nDiseases in the adult population [1:42:30]\nLiver disease is high on the list\n\nCirrhosis\nLiver cancers (mostly from hepatitis B)\n\nHepatitis B is very common\n\nTom vaccinates all the kids in his hospital which is helpful\nHowever, doesn’t have the funds or capability to get vaccines to the villages so it’s still very prevalent\n\nDiphtheria\n\nThis hasn’t been seen since the 1940s in the US yet it shows up in Africa due to lack of vaccines\n\nLeprosy\n\nIn the tuberculosis family\nTransmitted by respiratory droplets and prolonged close contact \nNot by touch which is a misunderstanding, which leads to these people being shunned in the community\n\nTuberculosis ⇒ Very prevalent\nHIV ⇒ actually quite low\n\nLess than 1% \nWhy? Mostly because Nuba is so isolated\nBut if peace comes to the whole region and it opens up you will likely see a rise of HIV because it is sexually transmitted \n\nSTDs are common\n\nGonorrhea\nSyphilis\n\nWhat about heart disease?\n\nNot heart disease, but they do see congestive heart failure for people in their 60s & 70s\nNot atherosclerotic in origin ⇒ Tom’s never seen a single case of myocardial infarction in over 10 years\nHe posits that it is untreated hypertension (many people have BP of 250 over 180)\n\nHow prevalent is obesity?\n⇒ Obesity is almost non-existent (maybe someone is slightly overweight but that’s it)\nWhat about Type 2 Diabetes?\n⇒ Rare, but it is seen in some people in the 50s\nFatty liver disease?\n⇒ Never\nCancers in Nuba versus the US\n\nIn the United States… the top 5 cancers are lung, breast, colon, prostate, pancreas\nNone of these are prevalent in Nuba\n\nCommon cancers in Nuba\n⇒ In kids… \n\nBurkitt’s lymphoma (common in areas with malaria)\nFortunately, this is a very treatable cancer, even in Nuba\n\n⇒ In adults…\nLiver cancer\n\nMost common of all (hepatocellular carcinoma)\nProbably all related to hepatitis B positivity\n\nCervical cancer in women\n\nCan’t do pap smears to screen for HPV because it’s impractical b/c can’t send results to get tested (so even the equipment to do a pap smear wouldn’t be helpful to have)\nWhat would be helpful?\n\nVaccines, specifically Gardasil, but only if they were made available at a very low cost ",

I like it, but I don’t think I could stay long-term. . .I do feel much more at home in the Nuba mountains where it’s very quiet and kind of sedated and your time is your own when you’re off.”\nWhat possessions do you value?\n“I think I’m very much a minimalist since I was born. All these clothes you see me wearing, the socks, the trousers, both these shirts I bought when I came out of Nuba last month.”\n“I really do believe that the more detached you become, not like in this Buddhist kind of nirvana sense, but the more detached you are from things, the easier life is. It just simplifies your life.”\nFinding meaning\n“I do feel better with less and I think everybody is looking for some meaning in life.”\nBook recommendation: Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl\nFavorite Bible passage\nMatthew 19:16-22\nThe verse in Tom’s words:\nThe basic story is there’s a guy, the guy is a very wealthy young man, and he goes to Jesus. It says he tried to justify himself and says, “Look, what do I have to do to get eternal life?” And Jesus says, “Well, follow the prophets. You’ve got all this stuff there. Follow the 10 commandments. Follow the laws of the prophets and you’ll be okay.” And the guy says, “Well, I do all those things. What do we need to do to really become perfect?” And Christ said, “Sell everything you have. Pick up your cross and follow me.” And it says something which I think is very beautiful. It says, “The man went away, very sad because he had many possessions.” He couldn’t do it. \n⇒ Tom’s take: \n\nIt’s not saying being rich is bad, or rich people are bad people. I think that is missing the point. It’s just very difficult because it’s very difficult to be detached from things when you have a lot of possessions.\nIs this thing where you put your values? Is your value in the car you drive, and what kind of beer you drink, or whatever? Or is your value more in people and what you’re doing and how you’re helping people?\n",

You’re just sort of saying, “Look, I’m, I’m here to serve you.” And your example is what’s actually doing the talking as opposed to your words. \n\nTom agrees with this sentiment and quotes St. Francis:\n“Preach always, sometimes use words.” \nSense of purpose, happiness, and suicide: Contrasting the US with Nuba [2:11:00]\nAre there any cases of suicide in Nuba?\n\n“Extremely rare”\nPeter surmises, “There must be a different sense of fulfillment, contentment, happiness, sense of purpose there versus here.”\n\nSuicide in the US\n\nSuicide is among the top 10 causes of death in every age demographic except for 0 to 10\nBut that’s just “fast suicide,” when you kill yourself immediately\nWhen you include the ‘slow suicide’, when people that kill themselves with alcohol and drugs over time, it is actually in the top-five causes of death across the board\n\nHow is it that Nuba has 1/1000th of the privilege of the US, yet suicide is so rare?\n“When you’re really gripped in this struggle to survive, every day, you have that sort of primal instinct of survival, your mind doesn’t drift off to other things. . .Suicide is so inward-looking, so focused on your own misery that you can’t come out of it.”\nBook recommendation: Tribe by Sebastian Junger\n\nIn the book, Tribe, he writes about post-9/11, suicide rates went down in New York\nIt speaks to what Tom is saying…\n“When there’s a real struggle, when there’s something that can bring people together in a common goal, or there’s something that unites people, it can presumably distract from some of that pain that can otherwise hurt us.”\n\nRelating it to PTSD in US Veterans\n\nSomebody’s fighting in Iraq or Afghanistan, and they survive all that\nThey come back home, they get despondent and they commit suicide\nTom posits: \n“Maybe what kept them alive during the fighting was a sense of camaraderie, togetherness, fighting for a common goal. . .\n. . .we’ve had this huge rate of suicide amongst veterans that come back. Not so much from the trauma they had during the fighting. . . but the sense of loss of any bonds, that human contact with other people, that sense of purpose is gone.”\n\n“It would be interesting if there would be a way to pair a void that exists here in this country, a void of purpose, with a part of the world where purpose is not lacking, but resources are lacking.”\nOther than donations, is there a way people can help Tom and other similar causes? [2:19:15]\nPeter asks… So how can people help? Giving is of course the most obvious. . . but is there something else people can do?\nFirst of all, \n⇒ “Never underestimate the value of a donation to someone you trust, or a group you trust, or an organization you trust. The amount the impact that has is tremendous. We can’t do anything in our work without financial resources.”\nSecondly, \n⇒ Bringing awareness to those in need\n\n“If you have a knack for advocacy, or work in government, be aware of the political situations there, advocate on behalf of some of these people that are oppressed, or having difficult lives, whether it’s working in issues of poverty, or poor health, poor education. I think people have a voice to offer, and people do have an influence over governments.”\nGovernment policies and government funding is a reflection of the constituents\nSo to fund projects like Mother of Mercy, the politicians will have to know that the people (the constituents) want that\n\nThe ultimate goal of help\n“The goal is to eventually let these people who are beneficiaries stand on their own two feet maybe in the next generation, the next go-around.”\n\nThe cycle of aid and dependency is a bad thing, this is known… \nBut you can’t do anything without some help at this point",

And the starfish are going to die pretty soon if they don’t get back in the water, which means they’re pretty much all going to die. The two guys are walking, and every few steps, one of the guys bends down and he picks up a starfish and he throws it back in the water. And five steps later, he does it again, and again, and again. After like the 10th one, the one guy says to him, “What are you doing?” And he says, “Well, if these starfish don’t get back in the water, they’re gonna die.” And he goes, “Have you looked and seen how many of them there are? You can’t possibly make a difference.” And he throws another one in the water, and he says, “Well, it made a difference to that one.”\nTom’s response to the story:\nIn the end, medicine is individual. It’s the beauty of our profession. And it’s a huge privilege to have the opportunity to affect one person. And in the end, you close the door and it’s you and the patient, whether you’re in Nuba mountains, whether you’re here in New York. And that’s an incredible privilege. And I think if we keep that focus, just one person at a time, I think people can kind of relax a bit. You can see that what you’re doing for that one person. . .I think people look at Africa and say, “What you’re doing is a drop in the ocean.” I really like that story because when you’re there, you don’t see a drop in the ocean. You see a person. You see a life. And you see somebody that can laugh, and can cry, and can play, has aspirations, and is a living, breathing human being. You think, “Man, we helped this one person.” That’s a huge thing, you know? But I think that helps to stave off some of the burnout and the cynicism. This is a very individual thing, so one person is really a big deal. It’s everything to that one person, that one person’s family. And I think we really have to keep that in mind, especially with this growing realm of cynicism and sort of negativity that we see now.\nPeter sums it up:\n“For people on the front lines, I don’t think there’s a human being on this planet who throws more starfish back in the water than you.”\n",
