Vamsi is currently focused on finding clinical treatments for the 300-some identified rare mitochondrial disorders, but in this work there is a wealth of potential implications for longevity and chronic disease. In this conversation, Vamsi elucidates how the latest research could give insight into conditions related to aging, including but not limited to Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, cancer, and much more. We also explore some of the most exciting potential therapies for mitochondrial diseases such as hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), how exercise affects the mitochondria, the use of hyperbaric chambers for cancer therapy, and the mechanisms by which metformin might confer longevity benefits in a non-diabetic individual. \nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#66 - Vamsi Mootha, M.D.: Aging, type 2 diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease – do all roads lead to mitochondria?\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#66 - Vamsi Mootha, M.D.: Aging, type 2 diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease – do all roads lead to mitochondria?\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#66 - Vamsi Mootha, M.D.: Aging, type 2 diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease – do all roads lead to mitochondria?\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t",

In the process, protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, and oxygen is reduced to form water.

And then you can dissipate that battery to basically catalyze the formation of ATP, which most people know is the energy form that used to power muscle when you exercise.

[1:22:00]\n\nAnother signature of time is inflammation within muscle cells \n\nMuscles become more inflamed as they age\n\n\nWhat is drawing inflammatory cells into muscle as we age? \n\n\nA recent paper used STING pathway to block the ability of a cell to sense breakdown in nucleic acid\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Mitochondria as regulators of innate immune response. Image credit: (Sun et al., 2016)\n\n\n\nThe hypothesis:\n\nmtDNA is bacterial in origin and a loose fragment of bacterial DNA in a cell would produce an immunogenic reaction (the immune system interpreting the mtDNA is foreign) \nWith increased mitochondrial damage in a cell results in elevated exposure of the mtDNA, eliciting an immunogenic response \n\n\nTo test the hypothesis, STING pathway was utilized – blocking the ability of a cell to sense general nucleic acid (independent of nuclear or mitochondrial origins)\n\n\nAnother study finding supported inflammation in response to mtDNA and formulated peptides \n\nFractionation identified that sterile crush injury (in which skin is not broken but there is a massive inflammatory response) inflammation was in response to mitochondrial derived molecules \n\n\n\nProtein Translation: Eukaryotes and Bacteria\n\nIn eukaryotes, protein translation begins with methionine residue \nIn bacteria it is a modified molecule called formylmethionine\n\nit is a signature of a bacterial derived protein \nmitochondria, with bacterial origins, have 13 proteins that begin with formylmethionine \n\n\nHumans have receptors to detect formulated peptides as a screen for infection \n\nIf mtDNA remains in the mitochondrion, they are protected from immune-detection and response\nIn certain injuries mtDNA can escape and incite an inflammatory response  \nIn the two examples – either by mitochondrial damage or acute injury – there is an inflammatory response due to the exposure of mtDNA, interpreted by the immune system as bacterial \n\n\n\nExercise and mitochondrial health: Is there an optimal exercise strategy to slow the aging process? [1:27:00]\nIf the aging inflammatory phenotype is not beneficial, could preventing or rejuvenating broken mitochondria slow the aging process?\n\nExercise is one of the best ways to turn over bad mitochondria and induce mitochondrial biogenesis \nBut exercise does a lot of things, so positive mitochondrial impact does not adequately answer the aging-mitochondrial health relationship \n\nIs there an optimal exercise strategy for mitochondrial health?\nAt the center of the optimal exercise question is understanding the role of exercise in mitochondrial health\n\nThree types of (loose) exercise buckets being \n\n\nstrength training\naerobic training requiring maximum mitochondrial output with minimal generation of lactate\nanaerobic training that demands ATP and favors the lactate production pathway \n\nMore about exercise…\n\nEach form of exercise are beneficial but it is hard to differentiate cardiometabolic benefit versus protective due to other factors associated with a given age profile (frailty, for example, in older age guarded against with weight-bearing exercise)\nQuantity and quality of exercise also matters\nAs it pertains to exercise, Peter is most interested in understanding how exercise can be optimally tailored, or prescribed, to impact all causes of mortality \nAlthough the proven relationship is not yet clear, there are predicted non-linear dynamics of mitochondria as a function of both age and exercise\n\nSuspending use of skeletal muscle leads to lean mass and mitochondria loss:\nMeasurable VO2 max degradation after 10 days of hospitalized bed rest, which takes about six weeks to recover\n\n\nThe programs that turn on mitochondria during exercise are elaborate\n\n 17 different inputs into the system through exercise may all be necessary, with the right dynamics, and the right off rates to induce mitobiogenesis \nThe ragged-red fiber of muscle disorders represents an accumulation of poorly functioning mitochondria\n\nOnly a two to three of necessary inputs may be adequate to produce more malfunctioning mitochondria, but all 17 inputs may be necessary to produce healthy mitochondria\n\n\n\n\nThe PGC-1 alpha program turns on mitochondrial biogenesis while simultaneously turns on autophagy programs – turning over bad mitochondria while creating more healthy mitochondria\nMany diseases are ultimately reduced by exercise \n\nWhat autophagy means in the context of mitochondria [1:36:15]\n\nWith proper exercise regimes, there have been observed transcriptional programs with multiple inputs that will turn on all 1,000 proteins to produce more mitochondria and induce old mitochondrial turnover",

An example of a lactate performance curve.

[1:48:15]\n\nWhen Complex I is blocked, the body senses it and there is a homeostatic response \nBlocking the Complex may turn on 15 of the 17 inputs needed to induce mitobiogenesis and other parts of the cell as well \nExperiments (1,2,3) in worms did RNAi screens to look for genes that would lead to a longevity phenotype when disrupted\n\nOne of the gene sets most associated with a longevity phenotype was the mitochondrial electron transport chain \nHowever, one of the gene sets associated with a reduced lifespan was the mitochondria electron transport chain\nThe subsets were distinct – 90 genes total are required for the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation\n\n\n\nWhy do the loss of some genes lead to longevity and others lead to decreased lifespan?\n\nOne hypothesis has to do with the strength of the allele: gently blocking the ETC (as metformin may do) rather than significantly inhibiting the ETC encoding\nmetformin may block the ETC such that it elicits a homeostatic response that is net adaptive \nVamsi submits that metformin is beneficial for a subset of the population who have type 2 diabetes\nThere are rare cases with drugs related to metformin, like Phenoformin, that can result in fatal lactic acidosis \nAn experiment evaluating the cross product of exercise and metformin – like that similar to the Ron Kahn study – would help inform whether the addition of metformin offers incremental benefit or counteracts the benefit of optimized exercise, sleep, and nutrition\\\n\nHypoxia as a potential therapeutic option for mitochondrial disease [1:52:45]\n\nThere have been observations where too much oxygen can be damaging \nIn some rare mitochondrial disorders studied\n\n ATP levels are defended by glycolysis (i.e., not a disorder of energy deficiency) \nthere are high levels of unused oxygen observed (despite high energy output a high level of oxygen returns to the lungs)\n\n\nVamsi’s lab now investigates ways to limit or reduce the delivery of oxygen \n\nUsing hypoxia chambers in mouse model studies in which air is diluted with nitrogen (21% oxygen reduced to 11%)\nIn some of the models with mitochondrial disease there has been a measured benefit \nIn an example: \n",
