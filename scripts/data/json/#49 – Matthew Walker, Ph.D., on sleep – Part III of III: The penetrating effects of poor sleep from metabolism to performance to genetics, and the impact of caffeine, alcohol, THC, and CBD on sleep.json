Of course, this speaks to why many hormones are necessary to drive the metabolic derangement, because also the cortisol level would maybe even oppose that. In isolation, what you just described would actually oppose re esterification of fatty acid.” \nMatthew: “Yeah, but in my mind, I think what’s striking though it starts to tell you that individual cell types need sleep.”\n\nWhat is the communication vehicle telling the phosphorylation to be less efficient?\n\nWe don’t know the intracellular mechanisms making this happen\nBut extracellular signals are clearly making intracellular functions maladaptive or less efficient\n\nEpigenetic changes with insufficient sleep, and the reversibility of lost sleep [18:00]\n“We often think of the impact of a lack of sleep on things like behavior, like driving, or making food choices. . . but there is something about a lack of sleep that will get even into cells themselves and alter intracellular functioning. If a single factor (sleep) can have its impact all the way from complex cognitive issues like decision making, all the way down to something like intracellular function, my goodness you need to look out if you’re depriving yourself of that one function.”\nEpigenetic changes\nPNAS paper\n\nGroup of healthy adults limited to 6 hours of sleep a day for 1 week (About the typical sleep adults get on avg.)\nThey found a change in the activity of 711 genes compared to when the subjects got 8 hrs of sleep (epigenetic change in 3% of their genome, only about 20,000 genes in our genome)\nAbout half of the genes were upregulated and half downregulated\nDownregulated (impaired) genes were ones associated with the immune system\nThe ones upregulated genes were associated with tumor production, long-term chronic inflammation, and stress / cardiovascular disease\n\n⇒ Losing sleep is like doing a genetic test on yourself\n\nPeople feel uncomfortable about genetically modified embryos, CRISPR, GMO, genetically modified foods, etc.\nBut you’re performing a similar experiment on yourself by not getting enough sleep\nAnd if you don’t let your children get the sleep that they need, you may be inflicting inadvertently a genetic manipulation on them as well\n\nAre sleep deprivation effects reversible with adequate sleep?\n\nSleep is not like a debt that you can repay (can’t make it up later, e.g., on weekends)\nThe damage from lack of sleep doesn’t seem to be reversible\nHowever, that doesn’t mean that from this point forward, it’s a waste of time to start sleeping better\n\nEvidence that fixing sleep (even in later life is a great thing): Sleep apnea study in older adults\n\nAdults with sleep apnea were given a CPAP to ensure they got enough oxygen\nRoughly half of the group complied with treatment and the other half did not\nThe ones who complied held off Alzheimer’s disease by 10 years\nSo correcting your sleep can actually change your risk of dementia\nIt’s a hopeful message: it’s never too late to start sleeping better",

    "content": "\nIt’s hard to know what sleep was the direct cause of the slowing of cognitive decline\nIt could be that sleep is the influencing factor ⇒ because you’re sleeping, that you start to eat better, exercise more and better, have more energy to make healthier choices, etc.\n\nSleep’s impact on exercise performance, appetite, and food choices [28:15]\nPhysical activity and food choices\n\nWhen you are underslept, you are less likely to be motivated to be physically active\nAnd when you do convince yourself to exercise, \n\nLess force pressure you can generate\nA reduction in the time it takes you to reach physical exhaustion up to 30% (E.g. if you normally reach physical exhaustion at 10k then you’ll reach it at 7k)\n\n\nWith enough sleep…\n\nyou will make better food choices\nlower your caloric intake\nincrease calories expended\nmore motivated to be active\nand work out more intensely\n\n\nAll of these things benefit cognitive decline, so if sleep is not ultimately the thing that is transacting the cognitive benefits, maybe is it the root cause \nThat said, it may be playing some direct part, though, given what we’ve found about sleep and protein pathology in Alzheimer’s\n\nIt’s never too late to start sleeping better\n\nIf you have been sleep deprived in the past, don’t think that your fate is sealed\nJust like people with T2D can improve by making changes to diet and exercise\nAnd how long-time smokers can improve just by quitting (also parallels because people who quit smoking may then be motivated do make other positive health changes)\n\nNo hope for a randomized, prospective trial\n\nUnethical to majorly deprive people of sleep\nAlso can even ethically deprive people with sleep apnea of CPAP\n\nSo how can we show benefits of correcting sleep?\n\nOnly way we’re going to be able to show the importance of sleep in kids is by having them sleep more\nKids of all ages sleep about 2 hours less per night than they did 50 years ago (no ethics committee would approve a study that would make kids lose 2 hours of sleep for a month yet we did it as a society)\nFuture studies will probably not be of sleep restriction but of sleep interventions and extensions\n\nDiabetes and sleep apnea\n\nPeople with untreated sleep apnea have far higher rates of diabetes\nWhen they are treated, their diabetic profile improves markedly\nBut so do their food choices, their exercise, etc. so unclear if it’s a direct benefit of sleep improving cellular processes or if it’s more a higher-order issue (when well-rested, you eat better, etc.).\n\nSleep and appetite regulation\n\nThis paper shows that subjects limited to 4-6 hours of sleep per night for 1 week will have: \n\nDownregulated leptin (the satiety hormone that signals to your brain that you are full and don’t need to eat anymore) is turned down\nUpregulated ghrelin (a hunger hormone signaling the body to eat more) is ramped up\n\n\nPeople sleeping 6 hours a night will eat extra calories during the next day\n\n\nFigure 1. Sleep loss and obesity. Image credit: Why We Sleep\nPeter struggles with food choices when sleep deprived\n\nWhen flying from NYC to California, he has to wake up at 4am\n“That is unquestionably one of the worst eating days of my life if I let it be.”\nTakes a ton of planning a brief moments of discipline to overcome the crazy cravings he has under those sleep deprived conditions (i.e. wants pizza for breakfast)\nTricks he’s learned\n\nWill make sure to have a good filling breakfast before getting on the plane\nDo not eat ANYTHING on the plane\nWhen land in CA he will have a filling snack (avocado and macadamia nuts)\nWon’t eat again until dinner which he will have early at 5pm\nThen goes to bed at 8pm\n\n\nMatthew: “So imagine someone like you [Peter] who has the knowledge that they have about sleep and then has this maniacal discipline to be able to fast for long periods of time. Even you with that arsenal of benefit in place can struggle under the weight of sleep deprivation. No wonder the majority of us non-demigods of control will implode so quickly.”\n\nJocko Willink \n\nPeter: “I’d love to see what Jocko would do under sleep deprived conditions with respect to food.”\nMatthew: “I would love to have a conversation, just an honest frank conversation about sleep with him.”\n\nType of food\n\nIt’s not just that you overeat when you are underslept, it’s also the food profile that suffers\n\nStudy looking at food choices when sleep deprived: \n\nSubjects sleep 4-5 hours a night for a week\nLet them eat anything they want from a buffet, they not only eat more calories but also worse foods (pizza, cookies, and ice cream instead of protein, nuts, and leafy greens) \n\nBrain scan study looking at reactions to food\n\nSubjects with restricted sleep were shown pictures of different food while in a brain scanner\nThe prefrontal cortex of the brain, which keeps hedonic desires in check, is impaired by sleep deprivation\nAnd the more primitive areas of the brain like the amygdala “erupted” in response to desirable foods\n\nDecision making, workplace production, leadership qualities, physical attractiveness, and more [43:15] \n“Essentially, you’re losing impulse control networks within the brain.”\nThere are places where controlling impulsivity is critical yet sleep deprivation is common:\n\nThe military\nAviation\nStock markets (Michael Lewis has talked to Matthew about how common sleep deprivation is on Wall Street)\n\nWork from Chris Barnes at University of Washington suggests that employees who are sleeping 6 hours or less:\n\nFirst, these employees select less challenging problems\nSecond, they produce fewer creative solutions to the problems they do select\nThird, employees working in teams just slack off and let others work (social loafing)\nFour, they became more deviant and less ethical (they falsified data and reimbursement claims, they claimed they’d done work other people had actually done)\n\nStudy looking at leadership qualities and sleep deprivation\n\nLooked at the sleep of a business leader\nFound that less sleep he had, the less inspiring and charismatic his employees found him\n“Even though they knew nothing about the sleep of that leader, it was evidential in their behavior.”\n\nSleep’s impact on physical appearance, dating, and mating\n⇒ Sweden study of the perceived attractiveness of people in a rested state vs. a sleep deprived state\n\nTook a picture of people under two conditions, full night sleep and sleep deprived\nThen they asked neutral judges to rate their appearance\nThe unslept picture was consistently rated as less attractive, more sickly and tired looking\nSo there’s some scientific proof of “beauty sleep.”\nIf you are trying to find a mate or be intimate, you won’t look your best if you’re sleep deprived\n\nThe broken water pipe analogy [49:30]\n“There is truly no aspect of a human being’s wellness that isn’t eroded by a lack of sleep. Lack of sleep is like a broken water pipe in your home. . .it will leak down into every nook and cranny of your physiology.”\n\nSleep impacts the macro (complex diseases, leadership qualities, and physical appearance)\nSleep impacts the micro (intracellular pathways, phosphorylation of AKT) \nLike leaking water, sometimes it’s gushing, and other times it’s a slow drip.\n“There are few things in your biology or your psychology that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation and get away unscathed.”\n\nEvolution didn’t prepare us for sleep deprivation\n\nIn an evolutionary sense, we’ve kept this strange thing around for half a billion years\nSleep is a ridiculous proposition and makes no sense on the surface\nWhile you’re sleeping you can’t get food or mate or protect yourself or care for your children\nWe’ve had time to prepare for starvation (ketosis) and excess food as we evolved as a species\n\nSee this paper by Rick Johnson on genetic changes in metabolism of fructose allowed us to fatten up in the fall when fruit was sweeter, which was a little bit of preparation for what we do with excess nutrients in the modern era\n\n\nBut only in the last 150-250 years (and particularly the last 40) has there been a new pressure to reduce sleep\n\nThe negative effect of caffeine, alcohol, and high carb meals on sleep quality [53:30]\n“We know for a fact that 10 million American adults in the past month have swallowed some kind of a sleep aid.”\nAlcohol \n\nAlcohol is probably the most misunderstood “sleep aid”\nBut alcohol does 3 things to sleep: \n\n1) it’s a sedative so works like sleeping pills… you might lose consciousness more quickly, but you’re not “falling asleep” faster\n2) alcohol fragments sleep so you wake up many more times during the night; often so brief that you don’t remember but they have an impact on your physiology\n3) alcohol blocks REM sleep, so you wake up unrefreshed and unrestored\n\n\n\nCaffeine\n\nPeople often take caffeine (“adenosine-reducing substance”) to stay awake\nShould not need caffeine before midday ⇒ your peak alertness should be around 11 or 12\nMatthew notices that many people sleep on a plane at 10am when they should be getting to their most alert state\n\nHow caffeine works:\n\nAdenosine builds up like a sleepiness signal and when you have a lot, it tells you to go to sleep\nCaffeine blocks adenosine receptors in the brain ⇒ it’s hitting the “mute button” on sleepiness\n\nHow long does caffeine last in your system?\n\nCaffeine has a half-life of 6 hours\nAnd a quarter life of 12 hours\nSo if you drink a full cup of coffee at noon, quarter of that caffeine is still in the brain at midnight\nIt’s like drinking a quarter of a cup of coffee right before bed\nEven for people who say they sleep just fine after consuming caffeine, one study showed that 200 mg of caffeine before bed resulted in a 20% reduction in deep sleep (the same as aging you 20 or 30 years to get the same drop)\n\nAre there variations in people’s responses to caffeine?\n\nPeter says caffeine has no effect on him, when he’s tired, it will NOT wake him up\nSome people are more sensitive to it than others ⇒ There is variation in the genes that are associated with the enzyme that decomposes caffeine \nBut… it is unclear whether people who are less sensitive to caffeine also have less reduction of their deep sleep.\n\nUsing the Oura ring to see the effects of alcohol\n\n[Peter discloses that he is an investor and advisor in Oura] \n“There is no greater behavioral tool to show you the deleterious effects of alcohol than this ring.”\nMost people’s sleep is affected with just one or two drinks\nFor Peter…\n\nA single drink 4-5 hours before bed does not have an effect\nBut, 2 drinks 4-5 hours before bed, or just a single drink a couple hours before bed and “my sleep is shot”\n\nResting heart rate 6-8 beats higher\nHeart rate variability is compressed by 20%\nRespiratory rate is increased by 2 breaths/minute\nBody temperature up by .3-.6 degrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Oura ring results from Peter showing HRV\n⇒ This is bad news for people who enjoy a night cap\n\nYou need your heart rate to decrease\nYou need to drop your core body temp by 2-3 degrees F to initiate sleep\nBut alcohol raises your core body temperature, so you get more fragmented sleep, more awakenings, and you disrupt REM sleep\n“On every one of those levels, that’s exactly what we see in a scientific evidence.”\n\n⇒ Alcohol makes you have to pee more in the night\n\nAlcohol inhibits vasopressin\nSo you urinate disproportionately more than you’re consuming because it inhibits an anti-diuretic hormone\n\n⇒ High carb meal before bed\n\nA meal high in “bad” carbohydrates (i.e. bowl of cereal) can have a harmful effect on sleep quality similar to alcohol\nPeter has seen this consistently in himself\n\nThe efficacy of THC and CBD as sleep aids [1:05:30]\nReview of the literature on THC and CBD ⇒ Cannabis, Cannabinoids, and Sleep: a Review of the Literature. \nTHC\n\nTHC is not a good sleep aid for a teenager (because their brain is still developing)\n\nDoes THC help sleep in adults?  ⇒ “No. I don’t think I’d feel comfortable in suggesting that it’s a pro sleep compound.”\nWhat about different strains (sativa vs. indica)? ⇒ Not enough data to differentiate among strains\nWhat does THC do for sleep?\n\nTHC does make you fall asleep faster (reduces sleep latency)\nBut like alcohol, it blocks REM sleep\n\nTHC tolerance\n\nWith regular use of THC…\n\nyou start to lose the sleep latency benefit\nAnd if you try to quit using it, many people get “rebound insomnia” \n\n\n\nCannabidiol (CBD)\n",

I think we’ve got enough evidence to suggest that those two are probably not coincidental, but are significantly interrelated.”\n\nIt goes both ways ⇒ Mental health affects sleep, but poor sleep also affects mental health\nDeprive people of sleep…\n\nPeople without psychological problems can develop depression, anxiety, poor mood, etc.  \nOne single night of sleep loss can induce clinical anxiety in a person who does not normally have it\n“In the past 25 years, I have not been able to discover a single psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal.” says Matthew\n“Sleep is essentially mental first aid.”\n\n\nGive someone anxiety…\n\nTheir sleep suffers\nLike Peter’s patient above, curing mental problems and you can correct sleep problems\n\n\nPsychiatrists used to think poor sleep was a symptom of a disorder, but maybe they should have considered whether it was a cause\n\nHow long does it take to develop issues?\n\nIt may take some issues a long time to develop (dementia)\nBut others not long at all (memory consolidation and anxiety)\nAfter about 16 hours of being awake many things start to go wrong, but mental health seems to be one of the quickest to fall apart\n\nHow sleep impacts memory, and Matthew’s current and upcoming projects [1:24:00]\nWhat have you been doing during your sabbatical year?\n\nStill the Director the Center for Human Sleep Science at Berkeley\nAfter book published, been doing public speaking and media appearances\n\nCheck out Matthew on CBS This Morning:\n\n\nBrain simulation company that has just gone public\nThere is research showing that you can boost the size and amplitude of deep sleep brain waves with electrical stimulation\nHoping to do that for the elderly and people with dementia to see if we can retain some of their learning and memory by increasing deep sleep\nYou place a device on your head that measures the brain waves and then sends electrical voltage into the brain\nIt’s essentially trying to “sing in time” with the deep sleep waves, trying to boost the size of the slow waves (which are diminished 50 to 80% in older adults)\nMatthew has already been able to demonstrate in young healthy adults that it can almost double the amount of memory benefit that you get from sleep\nThis this Berkeley News article for more about the mis-timed brain waves of older adults\n\n\nFigure 3: Compared to young adults (left), image shows how sleep spindles in older adults (right) peak too early in the slow wave cycle, leading to forgetting.

It was great to try and help shape that mission.”\nSleep’s impact on athletes: Looking at Formula One drivers [1:32:45]\nSleep really matters in Formula One car racing (or any high speed car racing, really)\n\nF1 drivers are subject to incredible jet lag having to travel across the globe for races\nSleep deprivation is going to affect margin of error and reaction time, which are essential in racing\nIf there is one gold standard measure of insufficient sleep, it’s not only just your response time, your basic reaction time, but it’s the number of times that you miss a response\nThis is called a lapse, or an error of omission (You omitted a response that should have been happening)\nSix hours of sleep for a week can drop your reaction time by as much as 300-400 milliseconds which in F1 racing can be the difference in being first and out of the race completely\n\nPeter’s observations in his racing simulator\n\nEven after one alcoholic drink, he drives worse in a simulator\nNot legally drunk (.02-.03 BAC) even though I am not drunk and my blood alcohol is very low\nAnd not just reaction time ⇒ His spatial coordination goes down, “which I think is a bigger problem” \n\nThings affected by insufficient sleep in drivers/athletes\n\nSpatial attention: Matthew says something called “spatial attention” goes down very quickly under conditions of sleep deprivation\nQuick decision making: When other racers are on the track, it becomes strategic and you have to make multiple decisions in split seconds, and sleep affects critical components of that\nJudgement: It’s incredible how much your judgment can be impaired when others are on the track probably due to sleep’s impact on impatience and impulsivity (can lead to irrational thinking)\nPhysical fitness: \n\nIt’s a physical sport too, and when your physical performance is mismatched to your natural circadian rhythm (like with jet lag) you will not be able to perform your best\nMost world records are broken at the Olympics during the peak of most circadian rhythm (about 1 or 2 in the afternoon)\n\n\nAs an F1 driver, if you’re shifting dramatically among time zones, you are losing a competitive advantage\nWe may be at maximum saturation with engineering and technology; it’s humans themselves that are important.  Athletes are paying attention to diet, nutrition, and mental health, but sleep is a factor too.\n\n“A team could spend 10 million on trying to shave off .1 of a second in a car, which would be heroic as an engineering accomplishment, yet you could be shaving off point .4 or .5 by way of human error by way of this thing called insufficient sleep, or mismatched circadian rhythm.”\nWhat separates the top professional athletes?\n\nPeter says it’s the ability to be consistently exceptional\nPeter, for example, can have one exceptional lap in a racecar\nBut the pros must do 70+ in a row for more than 2 hours without making a single error\nThat is a ton of focus and concentration for a long period of time (more so than most other sports) ⇒ in neuroscience they refer to this as the “time on task effect”\n\nTime on task effect\n\nThe longer you do something, your sustained attention will wane for pretty much any cognitive task\nThe longer you apply yourself to a task, the more insufficient sleep shows\nFor example, for the first 30 seconds they perform as if they are rested, but at about 4-5 minutes in you really see a difference in performance if they are sleep deprived\nThe biggest effect of sleep deprivation in terms of time on task is in sustained attention and sustained spatial attention so paying attention to these effects would be a benefit to racers\n\n\nFigure 4.

Image credit: Why We Sleep\nTranslating the science to clinical application [1:57:00]\nPeter:\n“[An understanding of sleep] is probably the single biggest deficit within the toolkit of most physicians.”\n“Few people are more critical of the absolute dearth of rigor in the nutrition field, but I think this is worse. It’s not the dearth in the quality of the research, it’s the dearth in the translation of that research to clinical application.”\n“I think your work has had a greater impact here than anything I’m aware of, and I wish you all the continued success. I think you could argue part of our humanity depends on it.”\nMatthew:\n“I am on a mission to try to reunite humanity with the sleep that it is so desperately bereft of. . .but the research has not been translated to the clinical practice. . .and that’s part of the work that I do with trying to be a sleep advocate.”\n“Early on in my career, I don’t think I did a very good job at communicating science, the importance of sleep to the public through the science, and that’s what I’ve been desperately trying to course correct with [Why We Sleep].”\n",
