    "content": "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter describes what it means to exercise with the goal of longevity in mind, including his personal goals, exercise framework, and how he is optimizing for what he refers to as the “Centenarian Decathlon.” He explains the various types of cardiovascular training and how to partition your time between intensity levels (i.e., zone 2 training vs. zone 5 training) to optimize cardiorespiratory benefit. Additionally, Peter dives deep into questions around VO2 max, such as why it’s critical for longevity, how to improve it, and the value in starting VO2 max optimization early in life.\nIf you’re not a subscriber and are listening on a podcast player, you’ll only be able to hear a preview of the AMA.

after the recent exercise content on The Drive\nToday will be some rapid fire questions going a little deeper on exercise topics\nIf all goes to plan we’ll cover all four pillars of questions that have come in\nIt should be a good well rounded AMA on all things exercise\n\n \nPeter’s exercise goals, and the Centenarian Decathlon [4:00]\nThe Centenarian Decathlon is simply a mental model for how Peter thinks about training\n\nIn Peter’s long experience with training, something became very clear: Specificity matters\nBut people confuse specificity with narrow, that’s not the case\nYou can be broadly trained and broadly conditioned, but with specificity and focus—that’s really what the Centenarian Decathlon is all about\nYou can be narrowly focused with great specificity, that’s what certain types of athletes are doing.\n\nFor instance, if you’re the best golfer in the world, there are some really, really specific things that you need to be doing\nYou’re training is basically focused on enhancing those very, very specific movements and probably some training to counterbalance the asymmetry there\n\n\nSo it’s very difficult to be successful in a physical endeavor if you are not pursuing some sort of objective\nThe “I’m just going to work out” strategy doesn’t really produce great results over the long haul\nAnd we’re going after a really hard problem—which is to be in the last decade of your life, what we call the marginal decade, and be incredibly robust physically\n\nWhat does that look like to be physically robust in the marginal decade? \n\nImagine a 90 year old who’s functioning like a 70 year old, but that is going to require a lot of preparation \nWhen you think about the inevitability of decline of muscle mass, strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, you have to be training for that with the same degree of focus and specificity that a person is training for to be an exceptional athlete in their 30s or 40s\nThe Centenarian Decathlon basically forces us to be specific in what our metrics are in that last decade of life, and it allows us to “backcast” from there\n\nForecasting from wherever you are today will almost without exception fail to get you where you need to go, because you’ll end up missing the mark by slipping underneath it\nInstead you want to start with where you need to be at the very end and work your way backwards\n\n\n\n \nPeter’s exercise framework, and how he tracks his MET hours [8:30]\nHow Peter’s training has changed over the years:\n\nIf you look at how he exercises today and compare it to how he exercised 8 years ago (time trialing on a bike) or 15 years ago (marathon swimming), there is no overlap compared with today\nToday’s training is really focused on something different which are these 4 o 5 buckets:\nZone 2\nZone 5\nStrength\nStability\nRucking (“I include rucking in there because it is so physical…and the psychological benefit of it”)\n\nEnergy expenditure per week:\nYou can identify energy expenditure by how many METs are required for each activity\nHow much time you spend in each gives you MET hours per week. \nAnd then you can get a sense of where your energy is going\nThat’s probably the purest way to understand energy expenditure across those domains, says Peter\n\nFigure 1. Peter’s MET hour per week. \n\nZone 2 is cycling for Peter — zone 2 is somewhere between 220 and 235 watts\n\nYou can use a calculator to tell you how many METs that is, so that’s 11 METs\nIf I spend four hours a week there, 11 x 4 = 44, so that’s 44 MET hours per week\n\n\nZone 5 is done by cycling or stair climbing, and that’s about 16 METs\n\nThat’s really pushing the intensity, but he’s only spending half an hour a week at that intensity therefore METs is 8 MET hours per week\n\n\nStrength is lifting weights and that’s about an average of five METs but it depends greatly on what type of lifting being done\n\nPeter’s best estimate is he’s probably averaging about 5 METs, which is really not that labor intensive, but you multiply that by 6 hours per week there’s 30 METs\n\n\nRucking – Peter puts 55 or 60 lbs in his rucking pack\n\nAt a 0% incline grade that is about 4.8 MET\n5% grade is about 7.5 METs\n10% grade is about 10 METs\nPeter estimates he’s averaging 6.5 METs, and he does 3 to 4 hours per week for a 20 MET per week score\n\n\nTotal METs is about 100 MET hours per week of activity\nNOTE: Notice the relative amount of zone 2 to zone 5 — much more time spent in zone 2 than zone 5 \n\n \nHow to partition your time between low and high intensity exercise to optimize results [13:15]\nWhat do we know about whether moderate intensity exercise is as good as vigorous intensity exercise?\n\nThe reality is both are important\nAnd Peter notes that he is now talking about this through the lens of assuming a person’s objectives are somewhat in line with his\nThis is a big assumption, which is do you want to be 84 years old and kind of able to do anything?\n\nSilly example to explain his goals:\n\nPeter and his wife just visited Italy (Rome and Tuscany) for a wedding\nThey had 4 suitcases that they had to lug all around and load them overhead into planes and trains\nIt was very hot, walking 7 miles per day, and overall it was a very physical trip\nAs a 50 year old, that trip didn’t phase Peter – but Peter wants to have this same vacation at 75 years old \nIf you actually look at the energy requirement, the VO2 requirement to do all the stuff I talked about, we’re abutting into the 30 mls per minute per kilogram range\nAnd so there’s a certain amount of strength, stability, and fitness you would need to be able to have that same vacation when you’re later in life\n“If what I just described is aspirationally, directionally where you want to be, you will need a combination of high and low intensity aerobic training, plus a lot of strength training.”\n\nHow much time should people spend on low-intensity versus high-intensity to produce optimal results? [18:30]\n\nMost people are surprised to learn that even the world’s absolute best of the best are spending on average probably 70 to 80% of their training volume in low intensity training\nWhen you’re talking about cardiorespiratory fitness, the best of the best are professional cyclists, cross country skiers, and they are distance runners (and perhaps swimmers)\nIf you look at their training periods, you have to understand that they’re all broken up into different phases\n\nIf you’re Tadej Pogačar and you’re training for a grand tour win, your preseason is the winter into the spring, you’re in season the summer, and then your postseason is in the fall.\nIt’s safe to say that athletes at that level are spending about 80% of their time, if not slightly more in what we call zone 2 — meaning lactate below two millimole\nSometimes people have a hard time understanding this because zone 2 isn’t that physically challenging, however, their zone 2 is really at a higher level\nTo put this in perspective… where Pogačar or any of the top cyclists in the world are in zone 2, which means their lactate is below two millimole, and they can stay there for hours and hours and hours at a time\n\nAnd when Peter was at his fittest as a cyclist, he could only spend one hour in that zone\nAnd where today he’s probably have a hard time spending 10 to 15 minutes in that zone\n\n\nSo their ceiling is so much higher, but again, to their physiology, they’re spending most of their time at a very low place\n\n\n\nWhat Peter advises his patients: \n\nPeter tells patient that basically 80 to 90% of their training volume from a cardio standpoint should be at zone 2, with the remainder being at zone 5\nAnd you can do as much time in zone 1 as you’d like, but we’re not counting that towards your training volume, because you don’t need the active recovery the way the athletes do.\n An age old adage that applies: “If you want to build a really big pyramid, you have to have a really wide base.” \n\nThe base of the pyramid is your zone 2 capacity, the wider the base of your pyramid, the higher your zone 2 capacity\nYour VO2 max, which is your maximum aerobic output, is the peak of the pyramid\nif you want to have that high peak, if you want that massive engine, you have to have a huge base\n80/20 is kind of the rule of thumb, which is 80% of your time building the base, 20% shaping the peak\n\n\n\n“If your objective is to live longer and live healthier, you just can’t go wrong with an 80/20 split of zone 2 to zone 5.” —Peter Attia\n \nZone 2 exercise: ideal training methods and how to determine your zone 2 level [23:15]\nModes of zone 2\n\nPeter says bike is his preference, however, treadmill is best for most people starting out\n“We have some patients whose backs and necks won’t really in the short run at least allow them to sit on a bike for that long”\nRowing is a great exercise, but truthfully it’s quite technical. So if you don’t have the technique, you’re going to hurt yourself on a rowing machine for 45 minutes\nTypically Peter would suggest if people have access to a treadmill, that’s the easiest way to go\nThe biggest impediment to zone 2 is that it’s much easier to do indoors than outdoors and therefore it’s nowhere near as enjoyable\nBut the reality of it is the efficiency with which I can do this on a trainer is unparalleled\nWalking outdoors, generally, isn’t going to cut it because for most people you need some elevation change, meaning an increase, you need to be walking uphill to make it work\n\nSo I’m basically just trying to manipulate weight and elevation change on a treadmill\n\n\nFor a person who is just starting, the treadmill is probably the safest and easiest.\nPeter likes the bike the most because it has even less impact, but again, for some people they’re so inefficient in that position that it becomes counterproductive\nAt the outset, the goal is just to increase compliance and get some of that muscle memory going\n\nBeginners can estimate the right pace on a treadmill as such:\n",

    "content": "\nGenerally have people get to the velocity that is going to be their maximum efficiency, and you’ll know you’re past that, when you feel like you want to start running. \nWhen you feel like to walk any faster, I might as well start running, that’s your maximum point\nWe don’t want you running just because of the impact—it’s 8:1 versus 3:1 application of body weight force to knee\nOnce you get to that maximum point, you increase the grade or elevation of the treadmill\nWe can do this off rate of perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate, and lactate\n\nHow to know if your in zone 2 without a lactate meter [26:30]\n\nThere’s the RPE test, and then there’s the heart rate guidance\nUse heart rate as the boundary conditions, but ultimately until you get lactate tested, you’re probably going to have to rely on rate of perceived exertion\nHeart rate guidance we provide people is triangulating between a couple of numbers\n\nFor those who don’t know their true max HR:\n\nIf a person doesn’t know anything, they don’t know what their maximum heart rate is, they’ve never done anything before, then Peter likes for them to use Phil Maffetone‘s guidance which is 180 minus your age (The MAF 180 Formula)\n\nYou’re 50 years old, 130 is probably your zone 2\n\nif you’re really deconditioned, you might be subtracting 10 from that\nIf you’re superbly conditioned, you might be adding 10 to that.\n\n\n\n\nUsing himself as an example, Peter’s 180-age puts him at 130 but he adds about 10 to 15 to make his zone 2 HR approx. 140-145\n\n⇒ See episode of The Drive with Phil Maffetone for more\nIf you know your maximum heart rate:\n\nyou’ve had a CPET or VO2 max test. Or you’ve exercised enough to know\nThen another rule of thumb is if you’re pretty deconditioned, I would say start at about 70 to 75% of maximum heart rate\nIf you’re relatively well conditioned probably start at closer to 78 to 80% of maximum heart rate.\n\nUsing rate of perceived exertion: \n\nultimately you default into this RPE state, which is once you lose the ability to talk out loud, not whisper, literally have a discussion with somebody on the phone, you’re out a zone 2\nif you’re speaking to somebody on the phone or standing next to you with great ease, you’re below zone 2\n\nFor very deconditioned patients:\n\nSo a person who is wildly deconditioned will have a resting lactate that’s almost two\nlactate is actually a useless proxy for someone who’s very deconditioned, because the minute they start moving their lactate will go from 1.5 to 2.5, but yet they’re barely feeling it\nSo in those patients we actually don’t want to use lactate. Lactate doesn’t really kick in until a person’s quite fit\n\nHow your zone 2 threshold changes with conditioning [29:30]\nBasically, when you first start doing zone 2 consistently, you will see improvements in your efficiency and therefore your zone 2 threshold may be at a higher output of work\nHowever, at some point you will plateau and the only way to meaningfully increase your efficiency is to add more and more volume of zone 2 work\n \nRucking as a versatile mode of exercise [31:45]\n\nIn terms of what zone you are in while rucking, Peter says “it’s above and below and in.”\nFor example, Peter is in zone 1 when on flat areas, he’s above zone 2 when walking on a hill, and when going downhill he’s probably zone 1\nAt the end of the ruck, his average HR might have been a 130 (therefore zone 1), but that exercise was anything but zone 1 — it’s more like interval training\n\nimportance of staying in zone 2 without interruption [33:00]\nIf you go out for a four hour bike ride and your bike computer comes back and tells you spent one hour of that four in zone 2, that’s not the same as spending one hour straight in zone 2\nThere’s something about that form of exercise that requires staying in that zone and just letting the body crank through that metabolic pathway without interruption\nRucking indoors?\n\nRucking on the treadmill is a fantastic way to get zone 2 and do so at a lower speed, frankly\nIf you’re challenged by speed or challenged by elevation, by all means put a little poundage on\n\n \nZone 5 exercise: modalities of training, time per week, and other considerations [34:30]\nModes of zone 5\n\nDoing your zone 5 via the same modality you do your zone 2 will lead to better crosspollination\n\nif you’re doing the majority of your zone 2 on a bike, then doing your zone 5 on a bike will make you better\n\n\nThat said, Peter likes to do zone 5 on the stair climber\nFor the purposes of what we’re talking about, Peter likes to get people off the bike for at least some of what they’re doing, because life is basically handled off a bike\nIf your only form of fitness is on a bike or a rowing machine, you’re missing a little bit of the necessary impact\nTherefore, I also think doing some of your zone 5 in that capacity as well, which again could be done on a treadmill with a ruck\nCould be done with a ruck sack outdoors, if you can find a long enough hill or could be done on a stair machine\nPeter does zone 5 once per week on Saturday\n\nCan you do zone 2 and zone 5 on the same day?\n\nPeter recommends you do your zone 2 first and then your zone 5 on the same day\nZone 2 makes for a great warmup for your zone 5 (it’s hard to do zone 5 without a big warmup)\n\nNote: Peter’s zone 2 protocol is four days per week, and it’s 45 to 60 minutes depending on the day\n \nThe importance of knowing your VO2 max, and methods for estimating it [38:15]\n⇒ For more on VO2 max, check out AMA #27\nHow to determine your VO2 max?\nGold standard is indirect calorimetry test \n\nYou’re in a lab and they’re putting a mask over your face, and they’re measuring with as much precision as is possible\nThis is still an inexact science of course, but they’re measuring the rate of oxygen consumption and CO2 production\nThose two metrics are what allow you to calculate all the variables of interest.\nO2 consumption of course is all you need to calculate VO2 max\nBut CO2 production gives you not just how much CO2 you’re making, but it allows you to calculate the respiratory quotient, which then allows you to understand fuel partitioning and total energy expenditure\n\nBut just as with zone 2, there are other ways to estimate your VO2 max:\n\nIf you have a really advanced sports watch, they’ll often have a feature on there that will sort of estimate your VO2 max based on how fast it thinks you’re moving, what your heart rate is, and then how much your heart rate recovers when you stop (not sure exactly how accurate these are)\nRunning based tests are also common such as where you run a given distance and then take the time that you ran that distance in, multiply, divide it by something and that’ll give you a VO2 max.\n\nHow fast you can run a mile, assuming you’re running it all out, can be used to predict your VO2 max.\nAnd those running based tests are reasonably accurate\n\n\n\n-So do you have to go and do a test? “No”\n-Is it something that’s worth doing a couple of times? “Yeah”\n-But is it something you should be doing a couple times a year? “No”\nUsing METs for VO2 max:\n\nSome of the machines (treadmill or a good stair climber) will tell you how many METs you’re working at\nSo they’ll tell you you’re at X many watts or  X METs and once you know how many METs you’re at, you can multiply that number by 3.5 and that tells you your VO2\nIf you get to a point where you’re like, “This is my maximum MET, I can hold this for a minute.” Well, if you know that number, if that number is 15, you multiply 15 by 3.5, that would be an estimate of your VO2 max\n\n\nFigure 2. Methods to estimate your VO2 max.\nLooking closer at one method: The Cooper method\n\nThis has a pretty high Pearson correlation coefficient, the R squared is about 0.93, meaning it’s pretty close to an actual measured VO2 max\nThis one’s one of the easiest to calculate (not actually do)\nRun as far as you can in 12 minutes\nMeasure the distance that you cover in 12 minutes, so you do it in miles, multiply that by 36 and subtract 11.3\nSo if you can run two miles in 12 minutes, so you’re able to run a six minute mile times two, multiply that by 36 is 72, subtract 11.3, your VO2 max is about 61 milliliters per minute per kilogram\nThese are pretty accurate ways to assess your VO2 max\n\n*One other point about testing your VO2 max: \n\nYou have to do the test in an activity that you are comfortable doing.\nwhatever you pick to do this test in whether it be at the lab or whichever one of these metrics you use, make sure it’s the thing that you’re used to doing\nWhen we send our patients to the lab, unfortunately, you only have two choices, it’s treadmill or bike\nWe really make sure that they are in the one that they are more comfortable in. Otherwise, the test can also grossly underestimate their capacity.\nIf you’re going to go through the hassle of doing the test, spend a bit of time doing that thing before the test\nGet comfortable being at full level of exertion\n\n \nTraining methods for improving VO2 max, and realistic targets for improvement [46:00]\n⇒ For more, see episode of The Drive with Mike Joyner\nHere we have pretty clear evidence\n\nThere’s a sweet spot in the intervals that you want to be using—you want them to be longer than what most people think of as hit intervals\nIf you do something like a Tabata, you will increase your VO2 max, however it’s not the “best” for Vo2 max\n\nSo what is a Tabata? It’s an interval that looks as follows:\nIt’s about 20 seconds of all out work followed by 10 seconds of rest repeated eight times\nSo it’s a single four minute interval where you do 20 seconds of work, 10 seconds of rest repeated that for four minutes\nSo this is the quintessential high intensity interval workout\nAnd those types of workouts absolutely increase VO2 max\n\n\nBy the way, rucking increases VO2 max\nThere are infinite way to train to increase VO2 max\n\nThat said, nothing does it better than about the four to six minute interval at about a one to one ratio of rest to recovery\n\nPeter typically prescribes four by four intervals for patients\nYou do four minutes of about as hard as you can go for four minutes, followed by 4 minutes rest in between\nThe goal is to roughly maintain intensity and a lot of times even try to slightly increase what you can do for each 4 minute interval\nThink about doing these on a bike, you’re always doing it by wattage: So you’d go four minutes at basically as high a wattage as you could hold for four minutes, and then you’re doing completely nothing for four minutes\nAnd then you just repeat 4 to 6 times\nPeter would do this for six sets, twice a week\n\nStudies showing longer interval training increases VO2 max:\n\nLinear increase in aerobic power induced by a strenuous program of endurance exercise | Journal of Applied Physiology (RC Hickson et al. 1977)\nVO2max Trainability and High Intensity Interval Training in Humans: A Meta-Analysis | PLOS ONE (AP Bacon et al. 2013)\nHigh-intensity interval training in patients with lifestyle-induced cardiometabolic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis | British Journal of Sports Medicine (KS Weston et al. 2014)\nMeta-analysis of the impact of interval training on VO2 max: VO2max Trainability and High Intensity Interval Training in Humans: A Meta-Analysis | PLOS ONE (AP Bacon et al. 2013)\n\nWhat is a realistic target for increase in VO2 max that someone could get? [48:45]\nLet’s say you have a patient who comes in. They haven’t been really exercising. They’re at 35, is it realistic in a year they could maybe get to 45, 55. How do you talk through that with patients?\nThe answer to this question depends on a couple things:\n\nWhen we talk about VO2 max, the implicit thing we’re baking into this is that we are talking about it normalized per weight\nAll the numbers these calculators are spitting out, they’re all weight adjusted, that’s totally baked into them\nMeaning it’s in milliliters of oxygen per minute per kilogram\nBut it’s important to understand when you sit on that bike and do the test or when you’re in the treadmill doing that test, that indirect calorimeter doesn’t care how much you weigh—It’s giving you liters per minute of oxygen consumed\n\nSo when you’re trying to boost your VO2 max, technically you’re trying to do two things:\n\n1 – You’re trying to increase how many liters per minute of oxygen you can consume while 2 – minimizing your body weight\nAnd so when Peter says his VO2 max 8 years ago was 70, it’s also important to understand he was 10 kilograms lighter than he is today\n\n“Even if today I could do the same volume of oxygen, call it 5.2, 5.3 liters. My VO2 max would be much lower than it was before, just on the basis of the fact that I’m 10 kilos heavier.”\n\n\n\nPeter likes to separate these metrics for people:\n\n“How much can you increase in absolute amounts in the oxygen consumption in liters per minute?”\n“And how much weight could you lose while doing that?”\n\nSo how much can you expect to boost your VO2 max?\n\nLike all things, the lower you start at, the more you can increase it\nIf you took the fittest cyclist in the world at their peak, a year late you’re going to get much more VO2 max out of them\nIf you take someone who’s completely deconditioned, you can squeeze a lot of juice out of that\nOne study (Hickson et al. 1977) had an average VO2 max pre-training ~38 ml/kg/min, and after 10 weeks of training was ~ 55 ml/kg/min (approximately 17 ml/kg/min change in 10 weeks under very strenuous dedicated training)\n\nAt the end of their 10 week training program , VO2max was continuing to increase, but the training was so arduous that all of the participants declined to continue (6 days/wk – 3 days of cycling HIIT 5*5 mins at VO2max followed by 2 mins of active recovery at 50-60% VO2max and 3 days of 40 mins of running)\nIt’s a small study of healthy, relatively young participants (ages 20-42), who were mostly not training in any dedicated way\nCeiling on VO2max will be age and training dependent\n\n\nMike Joyner talked about this in the podcast—he said you could get 10 to 20% of a VO2 max boost if you train specifically and consistently\nThe weight loss/fat loss component also can increase your VO2 max\n\n \nRelationship of VO2max with age and the required fitness levels for daily life activities and exercise [52:30]\n\nFigure 3. Relationship of VO2max with age and the required cardiorespiratory fitness levels for daily life activities and exercise. [Data compiled by Jayson Gifford from the 2020 ACSM’s guidelines for exercise testing and prescription]\n\nOn the Y axis here, you’re looking at VO2 max\n\nAgain, whenever you see numbers that are so big like 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 you know you’re looking at it normalized by weight\nIf you’re looking at absolute VO2 max in liters per minute, you’re going to look at two, three, four and five liters\n\n\nOn the X axis you see age\nAnd then you see three curves, a green one, a black one, and a red one\n\nThe green one shows a high fitness individual\n\nSomeone who is in the top 5% of VO2 max for their age\n\n\nIn the black curve you look at somebody right in the middle of the bell curve. \n\nThis is somebody at the 50th percentile of fitness for their age\n\n\nAnd the red curve is the lowest level of fitness.\n\nThese are people at the 5th percentile, so the bottom 5%\n\n\n\n\nIt now shows various activities and explains what VO2 is necessary\n\nRemember VO2 is ventilation rate of oxygen, VO2 max is what is the maximum ventilation rate of oxygen\n\n\nWhat this is showing is what is the VO2 for various activities\n\nAt the top it’s showing you to run at 10 miles per hour, which is a six minute mile and it’s telling you that’s about a 57 VO2 max",

I certainly want the optionality.” says Peter\n\n“Just line up for me all the 90 year olds who are saying, ‘I wish I had less muscle mass. I wish I was less strong. I wish I was less fit. I wish I could climb fewer stairs.’ These words have never been uttered in the history of our species.” —Peter Attia\n \nThe training necessary to maintain an elite VO2 max throughout life [58:45]\nFor someone wanting to have an elite VO2 max (i.e., top 2.5 percentile), can you do that if you’re not training more than 75 MET hours per week?\n\nPeter says he doesn’t think you need to be training 75 MET hours per week to just have a VO2 max that’s on that top, top trajectory\nHOWEVER, you will need to be training at least 75 MET hours per week, if in addition to training to have that level of cardiorespiratory fitness, you also want to have the strength/stability that matters\n“If I’m mapping out the time and energy that goes into the stability training, the strength training, the aerobic base and the peak, it’s hard for me to see doing this under 75 MET hours per week.” says Peter\n\nYou can get a sense as to why VO2 max decreases with age when you think about the three things that contribute to VO2 max:\n\n1 – Maximum heart rate, which is a huge contribution to cardiac output\n\nSo cardiac output is heart rate times stroke volume. So with each beat of the heart, you’re pumping that stroke volume out around the body, and that’s a big part of what’s delivering oxygen to the muscle\nMaximum heart rate declines with age, it’s reported to drop roughly linearly\n\n\n2 – Lean body mass of course is a contributor \n3 – Then of course cardiovascular training\n\nWe’ve definitely looked at studies where under 75 MET hours per week, you can achieve very high VO2 maxes. \n\nInternally, the team looked at this and did some analyses looking at some of the studies. And we’re looking at people that are achieving top 5% VO2 max, training 60 MET hours per week total\n\nThe amount of time this take really just comes down to how much other training do you want to put in for these other activities (strength/stability)\n\nPeter says, “In my view, the answer is it’s pretty hard to get there below 75 [MET hours per week}, if you’re going to devote 60 [MET hours per week} to your cardiorespiratory fitness.”\n\n \nThe value in starting early: the compounding nature of fitness [1:01:45]\nValue in starting early\n\nThere’s no area in which compounding plays a greater role than in this arena\nIt’s even more relevant than in wealth accumulation\nEverybody understands if you want to retire at 65 and live a life of leisure that follows, you have to work really hard before you’re 65 and save a lot of money AND that money needs to be compounded (i.e, you need to generate a return on that money)\n\nIf you start saving at 25, it’s a very different proposition than if you start saving at 45 or 55, if your goal is to retire at 65\n\n\nAnd what that example doesn’t even take into account is a windfall\n\nif you’re thinking about this through a financial lens to say, “Well, okay, I’ll save probably not as much as I should save, but maybe I’ll work a little bit later, or maybe I’ll win the lottery, or I’ll get an inheritance\n\n\nBut the reality of it is with exercise here is no lottery equivalent. There is no inheritance of money or equivalent. Everybody is on the same footing.\nEverybody is going to have to grind their way through the savings return compounded over time formula to get the benefits when they’re done\n\n“Time, intensity, and specificity are going to be necessary components to give you the optionality to be able to be as physically active as possible when you’re in the final decade of your life.” —Peter Attia\n",
