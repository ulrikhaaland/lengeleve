    "content": "\nThe fourth thing we look at are the two metrics of muscle mass: appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI)\n\nThese are two different methods, to triangulate on the same sort of thing, which is basically how much muscle mass do you have for your height\nThe ALMI is calculated by looking at the lean mass in your arms and legs in kilograms, dividing that by your height in meter squared\nThe FFMI takes the total fat-free mass in your body and divides that by your height in meter square\nFFMI is a much bigger number than ALMI\nThe absolute numbers aren’t what matters, what matters is where do you show up on the nomogram for your age and your sex\nPeter wants his patients to be north of the 75th percentile for ALMI and FFMI\n\n\n\n \nImportance of tracking data over time to see trends [10:15]\n\nPeter has kept a spreadsheet for better part of 12 years where he logs his DEXA data\nHe keeps track of the various things happening in his life during those phases\nThere’s a bunch of variables, such as:\n\nThere’s the passage of time\nMany changes in nutrition from very strict types of diets to fasting to completely unrestricted eating\nThere’s dramatic changes in the type of exercise he’s been doing\nThose are really the fundamental three changes\n\n\nTracking trends\n\nNot only does Peter track his DEXA data, but he does the same with his blood labs\nHe wants to see how does this number compare historically as opposed to looking at this number in isolation\nIt might be a pain to do this, but there’s high value in being able to look at stuff historically to monitor changes\nIdeally you can take your raw data and present it in graphical form and then include that along with all the historical data in tabular form\n\n\n\n“Trends matter. You’re treating what you see, but you’re mindful of the trends.” —Peter Attia\n \nDEXA scans in 2011: swimming, lifting, and a carb-restricted diet [12:45]\n\nFigure 1. Peter’s historical DEXA scan data.\n\nWhat you’re looking at is a relatively straightforward spreadsheet that simply records the data going back to May of 2011\nThe first DEXA scan Peter ever has was the same day that he did a hydrostatic dunk test\nOn that particular day, Peter completed a hydrostatic dunk test and it said he was 16% body fat which didn’t seem correct\nHe decided to go and pay the extra cost for a DEXA which showed is body fat to be 9.3% which was more in line with what he felt\nWhy was there such a discordance between them? \n\nUnclear, but perhaps he’s someone who can’t get a lot of air out of his lungs and therefore wasn’t giving a good enough underwater weight relative to above water weight\n\n\n\nDEXA scan results from May 2011\n-As you can see, when looking at his DEXA on 5/3/11:\n\nBody weight = just under 179.6 lbs\nLean mass (muscle and organs) = 155.9 lbs \nFat mass = 16.8 lbs\nBMC (bone mineral content) = 7.0 lbs\nFFM (Fat Free Mass), aka the sum of lean mass and BMC = 162.9 lbs\n% body fat = 9.3%\nVAT is unknown — unfortunately, this is back when they just didn’t have the software to show VAT\n\nThey probably gave segmental information on their reports, but he wasn’t paying attention to it at that time\n\n\nA couple years ago Peter started paying attention to ALMI and FFMI, but they didn’t have the data back then so all it could tell you was fat mass index\n\nagain, Peter doesn’t really pay much attention to that metric, but he does record it and what my fat free mass index was, and we’ll talk about that\nAnyway, you can see he doesn’t have his ALMI data until 2014\n\n\n\n–So, what can we say looking at those May 2011 numbers?\n\nAt 38 years old, his 9.3% BF put him in below the third percentile (very lean)\nFFMI of 23.4 at that age, it’s above the 97th percentile\n\nThat’s the highest line in the nomogram\n\n\n\n-The important question here is: what was he doing at the time?\n\nExercise:\n",

A lack of protein intake?\n\nPeter says he was definitely not getting as much protein then as he is now, and that played a factor in the loss of muscle\nIn the 3+ years Peter was in ketosis, he was tracking his blood level of beta-hydroxybutyrate every single day\nThe mean level over those three years was like 1.73 millimole was the BHB level\nYou can loosely say that a BHB level of about 0.5 or greater being the threshold of ketosis so there would be no ambiguity that at 1.73, he was well into the keto zone\nThe reality with keto is that it’s very difficult to get there if you’re consuming sufficient protein",

    "content": "\nIf you’re hitting one gram of protein per pound of body weight, you are invariably kicking off some of that protein into gluconeogenesis, which is effectively raising glucose and kicking you out of ketosis\nIn fact, Peter has trouble staying in ketosis in 2011 and it was because his protein intake was too high\n\nMore about his keto days:\n\n80% of his calories came from fat back in those days\nPeter did not see a rise in your lipid levels or apoB levels—a response that a number of people have with keto\n\nSome people who get profound inflammation as well, but he didn’t have any of those things\n\n\nPeter did an oral glucose tolerance test sometime around 2012 or 2013\n\n“It was comical how well I disposed of glucose” and it was also “very bizarre”\nBecause in theory when your carbohydrate restricted, you can sometimes have this paradoxically weird OGTT where your muscles become so insulin resistant in a physiologic response to the restriction of carbohydrates\nThey’re basically doing that to say, “hey, I want to make sure that every one of those 50 grams or whatever of carbs you eat today is going straight to your brain. I’m not going to let the muscle take any.”\nDespite that, Peter’s fasting glucose that day was about 90\nAfter taking 75 grams of glucola at 30 minutes, it went from 90 to 110 or something like that\nHis insulin barely went above 10 or something\nThose would be VERY insulin sensitive numbers\n\n\n\nA need for humility\n\nThis is an example of where we need to have a little bit of humility around this\nAt the time, Peter says that “I very naively assumed my experience with ketosis is the experience [for everyone]”\nHe was crushing his workouts, his body comp is good, his labs are good, everything is good\nSo why wouldn’t everybody do this?\n\n“Now just even thinking that or saying that just seems so dumb”\nThe reality is that there’s actually people who go on ketogenic diets and their lipids go through the roof or they become actually quite insulin resistant or they just gain weight like crazy\n“If you think about the Dunning-Kruger effect, I would argue that this was sort of me at the peak of mount stupid, in terms of relatively little expertise, but a high degree of confidence.”\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Dunning-Kruger Effect\n \nBlood biomarkers for evaluating metabolic health [25:15]\nMetabolic health markers\n\nPeter mentioned that body fat percentage is very low in importance \nMore important is: How is your metabolic health?\nNick asks Peter if he can elaborate on what markers Peter thinks are important in understanding metabolic health\nFor instance, if someone is going to try a new nutritional strategy, what can they monitor to see if it’s having any other effects potentially that are negative outside of maybe their weight on a scale?\n\nPeter’s response using himself as an example:\nLipids\n\nPay attention to lipids, both advanced and simple lipids\n\nTriglycerides \n\nTGs are always something he’s paying a lot of attention to\nBack when Peter was an “unhealthy guy” circe 2009 (post residency) his triglycerides were always north of 150 milligrams per deciliter\nDuring his subsequent keto days, his TGs ranged from as low as 11 or 12 milligrams per deciliter for a fasting triglyceride to maybe as high as 35 or 40\n\nFasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin response, homocysteine, C-reactive protein\n\nAlso during keto days, his fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin response, homocysteine, C-reactive protein were all in good shape\nHe didn’t pay too much attention to hormones at that time, but he doesn’t recall any issues\n\nTestosterone\n\nPost residency (before keto days), he has really, really low testosterone (5th percentile)\nAfter he began his health journey, his free testosterone bounced back in a big way, solidly into the 30th to 40th percentile \n\nUric acid\n\none number that was persistently elevated back in the keto days, was his uric acid which was “through the roof”\n\nHe didn’t really understand why at the time, but today he would argue that that’s probably because beta hydroxybutyrate is competing for the same transporter in the kidney that uric acid is\nAnd anything that raises ketones is going to probably raise uric acid",

    "content": "\nHe would only figure this out many years later when he started doing those really, really prolonged fasts (7-10 water-only fasts)\nDuring prolonged fasting, his ketones levels were getting very high and he was also seeing uric acid levels get really high\nWhile some of that may be due to DNA and RNA turnover, he thinks more of it just has to do with this substrate mix up problem—basically trying to make room for keto excretion in the place of that and having to hang on to more uric acid\n\n\nHigh uric acid typically suggests less metabolic health, but again, Peter thinks there’s an explanation for it that is distinct from the normal reasons why elevated uric acid is a marker for bad metabolic health\n\nLiver enzymes\n\nIn terms of his liver enzymes during ketosis, they were at good levels (always in the twenties)\n\n \nDEXA scan in 2020 after several years of regularly engaging in time-restricted feeding and prolonged fasting protocols [28:45]\nA long gap in Peter’s DEXA data\n\nTake a look at the gap between the timing of that February 2014 DEXA and then the December 2020 DEXA\nThat’s almost a seven-year gap (Peter isn’t really sure why he went that long between scans)\nNevertheless, he finds it to be super interesting to see the Dec 2020 scan compared to the 2011-2014 data\n\nTotal body weight change\n\nTotal Body weight only increased 0.8 pounds from 2014 to 2020\nOne might see this and say “Wow, this guy barely ages. What a beacon of health!”\nHowever, let’s take a closer look started with what changed over those years\n\nChanges to activity level\n\nPeter stopped cycling competitively — no more time trials, etc.\nHe also had one or two years where he was being “completely aimless and meandering in my exercise” doing everything from bootcamps to running to doing my own workouts\nBu he never stopped exercising and his training volume only went down slightly\n\nSo what really fundamentally changed?\n\nThe answer is he started doing time-restricted feeding (TRF) and prolonged fasting\nFrom 2014-2016, he was doing a ton of TRF such as OMADs (one meal a day)\nThen from 2017-2020 is when introduced fasting protocols\n\nFrom 2017-2018 do a seven day of water-only fast once a quarter\nBy 2019, he changed to three day water-only fasts once per month\n\n\n\nWhy did Peter do so much fasting over those years?\n\nThere was the belief that the net benefits of fasting made sense\nA lot of good things happen when you’re not eating—\n\nOur bodies evolved some remarkable mechanisms by which to be efficient with nutrients in their absence\nAnd we’re very good at recycling parts\nWe’ve had several podcasts where we talk about autophagy and what happens when nutrients are scarce\nSo the motivation was “this is a really healthy thing to be doing and this is a great part of my longevity toolkit”\n\n\nTo be fair, Peter is not trying to totally discount the benefits of fasting, the point Peter is making is that it’s possible to take a good thing too far\nIn Peter’s case, he admits that it was hard to notice changes when they are happening subtly especially when using a crude metric like total body weight \n\nI.e., “My scale says it’s all good. My weight hasn’t changed in seven years, that’s got to be good.”\n\n\nWhat he needed was better metrics for seeing changes inside his body — this brings us back to the DEXA scan\n\nPeter’s DEXA scan from December 2020\n\nFigure 4. \n\nFirst thing you’ll notice is total body weight barely budged\nThe more important change would be his body composition:\n\nFat mass basically DOUBLED from 14.3 pounds to 27.6 pounds (13.3 lb increase)\nHis lean mass dropped from 150 to 137.5\nThat translated to an increase from 8.4% up to 16.1% in body fat percentage\n\n\n\nPeter’s wake up call \n\nOverall, Peter wasn’t totally shocked that his BF% increased (he could tell he was a little softer)\nAnd to be clear, 16.1% BF for a 47 year old is not high (he was still in the 12th percentile aka leaner that 88% of people that age)\nHis visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was 113 grams and that is VERY low (3rd percentile)",

You are wasting away.”\nAnd combining Beth’s advice with Peter’s 2020 DEXA results, he decided to shift all of his focus towards putting muscle back on\n\nThree fundamental changes for Peter between Dec 2020 and Feb 2022\n\n1 – He stopped fasting altogether\n\nBetween December of 2020 and February, 2022, there was not one single day he went without eating\n\n\n2 – Protein consumption became the only macronutrient in consideration when it came to his nutrition\n\nHe adopted the goal of hitting one gram per pound of body weight\nSo at the time he’s eating 170 to 180 grams per day spaced out throughout the day to where he’s getting no more than 40 or 50 grams in a single sitting in order to get the maximal utilization in muscle protein synthesis (see AMA #40)\nThis basically meant Peter was eating a lot and eating often (at least 2 good sized meals and pure protein snacks mixed in throughout the day)\nIn terms of getting protein in isolation, Peter prefers eating venison jerky, Carnivore Crisps, and pure protein shakes\n\n\n3 – He added a day of lifting weights (more on this below)\n\nFast forward to August of 2021 for his next DEXA scan…\n\nTotal body weight is up from 172 to 176 (4 lbs)\nLean mass, however, has gone up 7 lbs \nFat mass has gone down 2.5 lbs\nBody fat % has actually gone down from 16.1% to 14.1%\nHe has a bit more VAT but still really low (about the 3rd percentile)\nAnd a “big recovery” on ALMI and FFMI\n\nALMI is back to 9.5 (85th percentile)\nFFMI is now 21.8 (97th percentile)\nFor Peter, there’s always a discordance there but he considers ALMI to be the more valuable indicator for him\n\n\n\nMore about Peter’s third fundamental change — more lifting\n\nHe went from lifting three days a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday; where each day was a whole body workout\nTo going four days a week; Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday; where two days upper body, two days lower body",

If it’s in front of me and I want to eat it, I’m eating it. There’s no consideration. That was it.”\n\n\n\n*Quick question from Nick:\nWhat have you seen with patients who maybe haven’t had surgery and maybe let’s say they don’t work out as much as you, but they are in the gym three days a week. But then summer rolls around and they’re traveling and they aren’t able to work out for two or three weeks. Do you see the same amount of muscle loss in a short period of time, even for people who maybe aren’t at your exercise level?\n\nNo, it’s definitely a function of lean mass because remember a lot of that you’re losing is glycogen and water as well\nIt’s a bit misleading to say we lose that much muscle mass — in the early days of that, it’s a ton of water weight\nSo the more lean mass you’re starting with, the more you can lose\nAnd the more inactive you are at a baseline, the less of a delta there will be\nThat said, Peter has a patient who had the identical surgery to him about two months later and he had the exact same experience weight wise\n\nRoughly speaking, he lost 10 pounds and he hit his nader six weeks post-op\nPeter’s not aware of literature that makes that case, but it would be a very interesting topic to look at what’s the average weight loss and then regain in body comp change, status post hip surgery, knee surgery, shoulder surgery, et cetera\n\n\n\nBack to Peter’s temporary “zero restriction” diet\nReferring to the months between his March 2022 surgery and his next DEXA scan in December 2022…\n\nPeter says it’s strange to go deep into his own weird psychology\nBut there’s a part of him that knows that he’s not going to eat this way for the rest of his life, so he made the decision to just enjoy this period of time\nAnd he could really sense the stress eating\nFor instance, he’d be overwhelmed at his desk with 100s of emails and getting “peppered by book edits”\nHe could just feel his anxiety rising\nIn those moments of late-night stress he would would walk down to the pantry and get himself a bowl of mini-wheats and “inhale them”\n“It’s sort of funny to think back at what I was doing” says Peter\n\n\nFigure 5. DEXA from 12/6/22.\nDEXA scan results in December 2022\nChanges to total body weight:\n\nNine months post-surgery and six months post weighing 172 pounds, Peter now weighed 196.3 lbs\nThat is 10 pounds more than he weighed preoperatively (Feb 2022)\nAnd that’s about 23 lbs more than he weighed at his absolute low point post-op\n\nTwo pieces of good news:\n\n1 – Of all that 10 pounds that he gained since February, two of them were muscle\n2 – His VAT was unchanged (down slightly, but within the margin of error and still under the 10th percentile)\n\nBody comp changes:\n\nLean mass went up slightly\nFat mass went up a lot (from 27 to 34 lbs)\nBody fat increased from 14.4 to 17.4%\n\n\nFigure 6.\n",

I was very pleasantly surprised that it was only 17%.”\nRemember, this is all relative:  Peter has patients who live at 25, 30% BF and they’d give anything to be at 17%.\nThe whole purpose of this discussion was to talk about the trajectory over a decade plus time and how changes in diet, fasting, protein, training and let’s not forget underneath all of this is age\nFor Peter, “age doesn’t explain what happened in the last six months. Let’s make no mistake about it. The last six months is clearly in an experiment in ‘eat as much as you want and see what happens’.”\n\nRecent blood work for Peter:\n\nPeter was pleasantly surprised at the results\nTriglycerides were about 45\nFasting insulin was about 7 – he’d prefer to be a 5 or 6 at the most\nHis testosterone remains normal at 11 nanograms per deciliter for free testosterone\nWhat about the liver enzymes? Did that go up at all with added fat?\n\nThey did go up a little bit, but he had switched to a different statin (from Pravastatin to Crestor), so it’s hard for him\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of statins is they’re so commonly interfere with liver enzymes at a low normal level that sometimes it makes it a little bit harder to interpret if there’s anything else going on\n\n\n\n \nPeter’s nutritional and training approach following his most recent DEXA scan [59:15]\nBFR\nPeter mentioned earlier that he added blood flow restriction to his training: Does he think BFR has been hugely helpful in gaining more muscle mass?\n\nIt does make a difference\nIf you go back to December of 2020 when Peter was “rock bottom” in terms of his muscle mass, and fast forward to February 2022…\n\nHe gained 15 pounds and all of it was muscle\nFat mass went from 27.6 down to 27 \nLean mass went from 137.5 to 153\nBody weight went from 172 to 187\n15 pounds up and a little more than 15 of that was lean mass\n\n\nSo how did that happen?\n\nThat was a lot of training\nA lot of protein \nA lot of BFR\nAnd he did dial back his zone 2 time from about 4.5 hours per week to 3.5 hours per week (though he probably added some zone 5 time)\n\n\n\nWhat is Peter’s plan going forward after his latest DEXA scan in December 2022?\n\nPeter is going to try something nutritionally for the next four months that he’s never done before\nUp til now, he has done it all in terms of calorie restriction (CR), dietary restriction (DR), and time-restriction (TR)\nPeter has done CR in the extreme version (i.e., 7 day water fasting), but he’s never done straight calorie macro tracking as a form of CR – which is his plan for the next 4 months\nPeter sent Layne Norton his latest DEXA results and ask for Layne’s help\nPeter’s goal is to lose 10 lbs and have all of it be in the form of fat\nLayne’s view is that this is possible if done slow enough and with proper macro tracking\n\nTracking macros with Carbon app\n\nPeter is going to use the app called Carbon (Layne’s app)\nit’s a great database in terms of foods \nhas a built-in coach\nYou plug in your body weight, your goal (lose 10 lbs), and the timeframe (4 months), and that you want to preserve muscle mass\nThe app then spits out calorie targets and it’s asking questions like:\n",

    "content": "Do you want to be low carb? Low fat? Balanced? Keto?\nPeter selected balance and protein as the biggest goal\nThe app has Peter at 184 grams a day for his protein target\nTotal calorie goal is about 2700 to 2800 a day\nIt also gave him fat and carb goals but within the first four days, he realized he was always under his carb goal and over his fat goal (Peter was defaulting to 30% protein, 35% carb, and 35% fat)\nPeter just told the app that that’s what was happening and it adjusted it\nTo be clear, the only thing Peter is paying attention to is calories and protein\nHe enters my body weight every day and every week the app is making adjustments\n\nOverall, Peter says…\n\n“I’m happy to be doing this is its good for me to have an experience with this because this is one of the three strategic levers that we want to use with our patients”\n“I want to be able to say, guys, I have experience with all of them, I can speak to the challenges of them”\nAnd not to be overlooked is how much the technology today is better than it was a long time ago\n\nSo your protein hasn’t changed now doing CR compared to six months ago?\n\nIt’s the same says Peter\nHe’s still trying to get 45 to 50 grams of protein four times a day\nBreakfast is usually 8 eggs (4 whole, 4 egg whites) with toast and butter\nHe supplements with a shake comprised of 24 ounces of almond milk, 50 grams of protein, and frozen strawberries\nSalad recipe is typically chicken, olive oil and balsamic vinegar (and other veggies)\nDinner is where Peter has the most variability but tracking it in the app is easier than he thought it would be\n\n \nA rundown of the various nutritional methods of energy restriction [1:06:15]\nFor more on this, check out AMA #40 \n***\n3 Nutritional methods of energy restriction \n1 – caloric restriction\n\nWhich means if you’re consuming 3,000 calories a day right now, we’re going to cut that down to 2,500 calories per day. We’re not going to pay attention to when you eat those calorie\nWe’re not even really paying attention to what those calories are, but there’s going to be an energy deficit.\nSo that has the advantage of being agnostic to when you eat and agnostic to what you eat\nIt has the challenge of being more complicated with monitoring all your intake \n\n2 – dietary restriction\n\nThis basically means “make something a bogeyman, and never eat it”\nThe dietary restriction approach effectively means: we’re going to restrict something but we’re not going to limit when you eat or even explicitly talk about how much you can eat\nBut by restricting something that you can eat, you’re going to default in to eating less.\n\n3 – The final way is time restricted feeding (TRF)\n\nThis means we’re not going to ask you to count how many calories you’re eating and we’re not even going to tell you what not to eat\nWe’re just going make the window in which you eat narrower and narrower\nAnd if we make that window small enough for most people, they will probably eat less\n\nPros and cons of each method:\nCR is restricting energy deliberately\n\nwhat’s the advantage of this?\n\nthe most direct way to solve the problem\nother advantage is it is the one that is completely agnostic to what you eat and when you eat it\n\n\nwhat’s the downside? \n\nit requires work, you have to actually do the tracking\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to DR\n\ndepending on what you pick to demonize, i.e, whatever you make your boogeyman, that’s going to determine how easy or how hard it is and also how effective it is\nthe more restrictive the diet, the more likely it is to be effective at reducing energy intake\nthe danger of DR is its pretty easy to still gain weight, still take on excess energy because you can still overeat through it\nit can be somewhat socially restricting depending on what you pick\n\nTR is conceptually the easiest\n\nTR is basically just don’t eat anything outside of your designated eating window\nthe big drawback is you can really get into a problem pattern around protein\n",
