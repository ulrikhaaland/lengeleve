In certain areas, one can have a ton of tumor without it being fatal. And in other areas you have very little room for that. It’s a volumetric. It grows by the cube, by the radius multiplied by itself three times. And that is, of course, non-linear. It grows much faster. The number of cells in a mass are much more than just the linear increase in the diameter of the lesion.”\nPeter notes, this is the part that is hard to understand\n\nWe do a good job with linear thinking\nWe don’t think exponentially very well\nThe point here is, we are flying blind from a diagnostic standpoint when the cancer cells number from 0 to 1 billion cells\n\n\nMetastasis of cancer is ultimately what ends of killing patients; when the cancer spreads\nIf the cancer is localized, a surgeon or radiation oncologist can cure the patient \nOnce the cancer has spread to many places in the body, it cannot be removed or you can’t radiate it all\n\nThe problem is what’s called micrometastatic disease or microscopic disease that has spread elsewhere in the body, you could have dozens or even hundreds of these micrometastatic deposits in different organs; and these are all under 0.5 cm\n\nThe detection of micrometastatic disease is beyond the limits of our imaging methods; we can’t see them all\nMax thought he could potentially get a handle on it if he had a test that could measure in the blood the contributions from all these dozens of micrometastatic deposits\n\nThis may provide higher sensitivity\nThis was his motivation to work on liquid biopsies\n\n\n\n“I had no idea how I was going to do that when I started it”‒ Max Diehn\n \nHistory of blood-based cancer screening and understanding the predictive value of tests [25:30]\nThe history of blood-based tests for cancer\n\nPeter notes, there are a couple areas where blood tests for specific proteins are being used for cancer screening; they’re not great\n\nPSA levels for prostate cancer\nCEA levels for colon cancer\nCA 19-9 levels for pancreatic cancer\n\n\nWhen Max begin thinking about developing a blood-based test initially for lung cancer, he thought of these examples\n\nThese examples above are all protein biomarkers\nProteins made by cancer cells that are shed into the blood where they can be measured in a non-invasive fashion\n\n\n\nShortcomings of protein biomarkers\n",

You try to push sensitivity, but that never is meaningful to report if you don’t also report on specificity.”\n Specificity is the inverse of sensitivity, for patients that don’t have cancer it is the report that their test is negative\n\n It’s the reporting of true negatives \n\nSensitivity and specificity are connected, you can push the sensitivity higher if you ignore the specificity  \n\n \nCurrent state of lung cancer and the need for better screening [32:45]\nWhat is the current state of lung cancer? \n“It’s the number one cause of cancer death”‒ Max Diehn \n\nOutcomes in breast or prostate cancer are actually much better; we can cure a large fraction of these patients\nThe vast majority of patients with lung cancer, historically, cannot be cured\n\nThis is why lung cancer is the #1 cause of cancer-related death\n\n\nThe incidence of lung cancer is going down in men and now also in women due to a decrease in smoking\n\nSecondly treatment have gotten better\nScreening is slowly getting better\n\n\nWhile smoking is by far the largest risk factor for lung cancer, it’s not the only risk factor\n\n“Anybody who has lungs can get lung cancer”‒ Max Diehn \n\nLung cancer can develop as a result of: pollution, radon gas or other things in the environment, genetic associations\nIf we could magically make smoking go away, there would still be lung cancer\n\nThe 2 major types are small cell and non-small cell lung cancer\n\nNon-small cell lung cancer involves adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell\n\nAdenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer in the non-small cell subtype\nWhen a non-smoker gets lung cancer, it’s usually adenocarcinoma\nSquamous cell carcinoma also makes up a significant fraction of non-small cell lung cancers\n\n",

They have… a high tumor burden.  And so, the tests are optimized for that; they work well for that.”\n\n\n\nLiquid biopsies have an 80% agreement with a traditional biopsy; they’re a good test for this problem \nLiquid biopsies are not designed for early cancer screening or detection \n\nThey are not designed for situations where the levels ctDNA are many logs lower \n\nThey’re not designed for this question of is the patient cured or not after treatment \n",

Even the GRAIL test… doesn’t screen effectively for prostate because you’re just not getting enough cell-free DNA in the circulation.” \nThe development plan for GRAIL was initially focused on breast cancer but they pivoted to other cancers because the early results in breast didn’t go well\n\nWho is the next group of patients Max wants to develop a liquid biopsy for? ",
