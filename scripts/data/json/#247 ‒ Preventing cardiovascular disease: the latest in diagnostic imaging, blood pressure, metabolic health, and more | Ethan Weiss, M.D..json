    "content": "\nEthan uses an analogy with his patients‒ a calcium scan is like a satellite image of your heart\n\nIt gives you a sense of any damage that has occurred over your lifetime\nIt also gives you a nice adjunct indicator of your overall risk of dying from a heart attack\n\n\nOne of the nice things about a calcium score is it’s very, very low in radiation\n\nEven CTAs are low now (we’ll talk about that later) \n\n\nThe calcium scan is also a very inexpensive tool; some places do these scans for ~$200\n\n(But you can still find some places still charging $2,000+ for the same scan)\n\n\nThe calcium scan is a low-risk procedure; it doesn’t require dye\nAnd it provides great insight, especially the first time it’s done \n\nEthan did a “full 180” on the utility of calcium scans \n\nWhen he first started his cardiology practice in the early 2000s, he thought calcium scans were annoying, and he didn’t know what to do with them \nObviously there’s epidemiologic value in understanding the risk of different populations\nNow he finds value in many contexts and even in individual patients\nA calcium scan doesn’t have value for everybody; in a 25-year-old, it is probably not worth anything\nCalcium scanning is now a tool that he uses regularly\nPeter explains this to patients as a 2×2 of young versus old and zero versus non-zero calcification (see the figure below) \n\nThere are two areas where the scan provides insight (shown in blue below)\n\nOlder people (70+) who have zero calcification\nYoung people (45 or 50) who already have calcification\n\n\nAnd there are two areas where the scan does not provide insight (shown in white below)\n\nIf a 40-year-old has a calcium scan of zero, you haven’t really learned a lot\nFurther, if a calcium scan of zero in a 40-year-old is accompanied by other risk factors, Peter would not be dissuaded from aggressively treating those risk factors\n\n\nSimilarly, when an 80-year-old has a calcium scan of zero, you might be less inclined to push for aggressive measures\n\nEven though there could be false negatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. 2×2 for interpreting calcium scan results, with informative results highlighted in blue.\n\nPeter has spent some time in the literature on this and learned that a calcium scan is a relatively imprecise measure\n\nThe thickness of the slices that are used in that scan are significantly greater than the slices that are used in the CT angiography\n\n\n\n \nPeter’s historical CAC scores, CTA results, and how one can be misled [10:45]\n\nWhen Peter was in his mid 30s (2008/2009), he had his first calcium scan\n\nAt the time, his doctor thought he was crazy because he was 35 and exercising at least 24 hours a week\nPeter has a family history of horrible ASCVD, so this scan made sense to him\n\n\nHis calcium scan showed he had a score of six\n\nHe had a single foci of calcium in his LAD (left anterior descending artery)\nNobody seemed to care because his lipids were not that bad\n\nHis LDL-C was about 120 mg/dL\n\n\nBut this changed his life and interest in this field forever\n\n\nFast forward to 2016 (6-7 years later), he had a CT angiogram and a calcium scan \n\nThe calcium scan showed a score of zero\nThe CT angiogram (which is at much finer resolution) found a tiny speck of calcium in the proximal LAD; no other findings\n\n\nThe remarkable radiologist Bob Peters explained that this is not uncommon, “That little speck you had six years ago can easily be missed”\n\nIf you had five calcium scans, half of them would miss it because it’s just too small, but now in the CTA, we can see it\n\n\nPeter repeated the CTA very recently in 2022\n\nHe’s partially interested in the progression of soft plaque\nThis time the calcium score came out as two and the CT angiogram was identical to what it was in 2016 (6 years earlier)\nSo you could certainly believe that if he had a CTA in 2008 or 2009, it would’ve looked similar\nAnd you could argue that for basically the same lesion, the score was six, then zero, then two (in that order) \n\n\n",

What different information do different scanners provide? \n\nDifferent scanners provide different resolution\nThe amount of radiation exposure is also different\n\nPeter notes this can be 10x different; some scanners expose you to 20 millisieverts (up to 40% of your annual allotment for radiation, which Peter thinks is too much)\n\n\nEthan points out another layer of complexity‒ how these different tests are applied and getting the information\nWhen Peter orders these CTA scans, he gets beautiful images‒  they’re 3D reconstructed and then they’re 2D sectioned \n\nYou’re looking at the lumen, the tube of the artery\n\n\nIn both a CTA and calcium scan, that little speck of calcium shows up in the wall of the artery\nYou’re also looking for soft plaque, but soft plaque doesn’t show up anywhere in the calcium score\n\nSo you can have a significant burden of cardiovascular disease without any calcium; that’s the thing that might gets missed a lot and that shows up in that 15% of people who have a zero calcium score\n\n\nAnother possibility is that where the calcification is placed is not problematic; it’s just that it’s a harbinger of whatever it took to get there\n\nDo you look at patients with a high burden of soft plaque and no calcification as having even higher risk?  \n\nEthan thinks a high burden of plaque is a problem, period",

How successful are the algorithms used to analyze the pressure drop? \n\nThe question in Ethan’s mind is‒ do the physics make sense?\n\nAnd he doesn’t understand the physics\n\n\nCan you make a calculation in a meaningful and reproducible way?\n\nTo Ethan, this is a distraction, he wants to identify asymptomatic people who are at higher risk \n\nIs there a group of these people who are special and might show a benefit from stenting?\n\nThis is something that no other group of patients has ever shown in the history of interventional cardiology\n\n\n\nWe’ve been doing this for a long time, looking for a group of people (outside of the acute MI setting) who would benefit from a stent being placed in their artery, and we’ve had a hard time trying to do that \n\nIn a sense, COURAGE was the beginning of the end of this; that trial was conceived of and executed by a group of interventional cardiologists who wanted to demonstrate the superiority of stenting over medical therapy\n\nIt was designed that way and all the bias was weighted towards getting that outcome, but it did not get that outcome\n\n\nAnd there have been dozens of studies since then, and there’s nothing that screams, “Hey, look, our job as preventative cardiologists or thoughtful internists should be to go looking for people who might benefit from a stent in the absence of symptoms.”\n\nEthan agrees with what Peter said earlier, if everybody got truly optimal medical therapy, if we didn’t have barriers to using all these tools in everybody, this disease would largely be controlled \nQuestioning the value of stenting \n\nEthan believes there is something else going on that’s residual (Peter may be an example)\nBut the quality of medical therapy today is so good that it’s going to be hard to demonstrate the value of stenting people\nThat assumes that stenting doesn’t do something harmful (which is an open question)\nEven before there were great PCSK9 Inhibitors, why wouldn’t opening an artery lead to improved outcomes outside of the acute MI setting?\n\nThis question has always plagued Ethan, even as a cardiology fellow\n\n\nYou’re opening up a severely blocked artery and restoring blood flow back to the heart; it doesn’t make sense that there are not more improved outcomes\nThere are lots of explanations for why that might be\n\nEthan speculates that the process of going into the clogged artery, blowing up a balloon inside it, and deploying a stent, might push the contents of that plaque downstream\n\nMuch like what happens when you break up a beaver dam in a stream; it goes downstream and causes its own set of problems\n\n\n\n\n\nHas a study been done on people who were asymptomatic at the time of being stented (they were not an acute STEMI), who then go on to have subsequent events, to determine the location of the plaque? \n",
