    "content": "Erin Michos is an internationally-known leader in preventive cardiology and women’s cardiovascular health. In this episode, Erin discusses current trends in cardiovascular disease (CVD) through the lens of female biology and the observation that major adverse cardiac events in both sexes are on the rise. She walks through risk factors including LDL-cholesterol, apoB, and Lp(a) and makes the case for the importance of early preventative measures. She explains various interventions for reducing risk including a discussion of statins, GLP-1 agonists, PCSK9-inhibitors, and drugs that lower Lp(a). She goes in-depth on female-specific factors that contribute to CVD risk such as pregnancy, grand multiparity (having five or more children), oral contraceptives, menopause, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Additionally, she explains her approach with patients as it relates to the use of hormone replacement therapy and provides advice for people wanting to lower risk both through lifestyle changes and medications.\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#230 ‒ Cardiovascular disease in women: prevention, risk factors, lipids, and more | Erin Michos, M.D.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#230 ‒ Cardiovascular disease in women: prevention, risk factors, lipids, and more | Erin Michos, M.D.\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#230 ‒ Cardiovascular disease in women: prevention, risk factors, lipids, and more | Erin Michos, M.D.\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n",

He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other.

Does it surprise you that this doesn’t get more attention?”\nIt surprises Erin, and she’s concerned that we’re reversing these trends\n\nRecent trends in cardiovascular disease \n\nThe first statin, lovastatin, was approved in 1987\nThat along with efforts in smoking cessation and blood pressure treatment, there was a significant decline in cardiovascular disease mortality in men",

The way our jobs are structured to be more sedentary and long commute times, having access to safe places to exercise and having time to do so, and the increased stress levels in life. I mean, there’s so many social determinants of health that have led to this problem.”\n\nThere are huge parts of the country that are food deserts, where there is not access to fruits or vegetables\nThere are also food swamps, where only cheap and easy, highly processed packaged foods are available\n\n\nAs individuals, we do have some responsibility for our life choices\nErin contends that larger issues should be placed in regulation and policy on a population level \nOnce an individual is obese, it’s much harder to lose weight\n\nIt’s far more complicated than just calories in, calories out\nThere are all kinds of hormonal regulations\n\n\nThe good news is we do have some new pharmacological agents that are beneficial in weight loss, that do not have cardiovascular harm like some of the older weight loss drugs\n\nThese may actually be cardiovascularly beneficial\nWe know the GLP-1 receptor agonist, at least in patients with type 2 diabetes, reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and stroke\n\n\nErin is part of an outcome trial ongoing right now with the GLP-1 receptor agonists in persons who are overweight and obese, but without diabetes \n",
