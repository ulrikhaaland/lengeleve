Actual and predicted acute myocardial infarction (AMI) counts for the week after the spring daylight savings time (DST) time changes. Source: (Sandhu et al., 2014)\n⇒ Other examples involving daylight savings:\n\nIncrease in car accidents\nIncrease in suicide attempts\nAnd Federal judges hand out harsher sentences on Monday after spring and are more lenient in the fall\n\n⇒ Furthermore…\n\nThe effect lasts for roughly 3 days\nIn the northern hemisphere, you’d predict the opposite if sleep weren’t important because more sunlight. . .but despite this, the lost hour of sleep still has big effect.\n\nStudy: Short sleep duration and incident coronary artery calcification.\n\nStudy tracked healthy adults without signs of CVD\nBy the end of the study, those getting 5 hrs of sleep or less had a 200-300% increased risk of coronary artery calcification\nThe study controlled for factors like exercise, smoking, BMI, snoring, etc.\n\n⇒ What is the mechanism?\n\nWith lack of sleep, the body becomes much more driven by the sympathetic nervous system (the fight or flight branch of the nervous system ratchets up)\nThis means more adrenaline release, high spike in cortisol levels,  and blunting of growth hormone (all factors leading to atherosclerosis)\n\nOther disease pathways affected by sleep deprivation\n\nLack of sleep increases blood pressure (hypertension)\nHaving an ApoE4 gene is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s, but one study showed that if you are normotensive (normal blood pressure), you don’t necessarily have an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, but if you are hypertensive, then your Alzheimer’s disease risk is far higher\nIt’s like revving an engine in neutral; eventually the gaskets will blow\n\n“If there is one central, common pathway through which we can understand almost all aspects of the deleterious impact of insufficient sleep, it is through the autonomic nervous system, and specifically an excessive leaning on the fight or flight branch of the nervous system.”\nFuel partitioning and dieting while sleep deprived [16:45]\nDietary changes when you are sleep deprived:\n\nInferior fuel partitioning\nHyperinsulinemia\nImpaired glucose disposal\nA tendency to probably eat more crap\n\n⇒ Peter says: “I’m at my worst when I am sleep deprived. It’s so hard to avoid junk food. Whereas probably the single greatest tool in my arsenal to eat well, is to sleep well.”\nFuel partitioning\n\nThe energy balance of organism (regulation and input) – how much to eat and how the body uses it – is affected by sleep\nRQ (respiratory quotient) goes up when sleep deprived\nRespiratory quotient going up implies that under the same level of exertion, you would preferentially go after glycogen for ATP, as opposed to fat\n\nThis signals a metabolic inefficiency\n\n\n\nDieting while sleep deprived\n\nThis great study showed that dieting when underslept (6 hrs or less) was much less effective in terms of fat loss\nIf underslept, 70% of what you lose is from lean muscle mass (the body holds onto fat)\nA big reason for this above is the high levels of cortisol (stress hormone) and insulin\n\nSleep and the reproductive function: testosterone, sperm count, FSH, menstrual cycles, and fertility [19:45]\nTestosterone in men\n\nMen who only get 5-6 hrs sleep have testosterone levels of men 10 years older\nMen who sleep 5 hrs a night have smaller testicles\nMen who sleep 6 hrs or less have fewer sperm and their sperm have more deformities in the sperm\n\nFSH and LH in women\n\nOne experiment showed:\n\nWomen who sleep 5-6 hrs have a 20% reduction in FSH (a critical part of the reproductive pathway) \nThey also have a 30% higher rate of abnormal menstrual cycles \n\n",

A few hypotheses…\n\n1) Is it an increase in the rate of mutagenesis? Do you experience, on a per unit of time basis, a greater insult to the genome?\n2) If the rate of mutagenesis does NOT increase, is it then that over time the accumulation and the expression, the phenotype of that, becomes more problematic?\n3) Is it that our immune system, specifically the adaptive immune system, is weakening and the balance starts tipping in favor of cancer? ⇒ Lowering the volume of natural killer cells (like the CD4 and CD8 cells)\n\nWhen posing this question to experts on the topic, Peter says they mostly stay that they suspect it’s all of the above, but they all agree that the weakening of the adaptive immune system is almost assuredly playing a role in why we get cancer more as we age\n\n\n\nSleep gets worse as we age, and therefore our immune system gets worse\n“One of the most dramatic changes with age, and the most sizable and robust physiological changes with age that we see, is that your sleep gets worse.

One Monday he was pre-call, worked 5 am – 7 or 8 pm, then volunteered to cover the ER that night.  Tuesday he was on call, slept 1 hour, left to go home at 6 pm on Wed when he had been up since Mon morning. On the drive home, every time he came to a stop sign he could not keep foot on clutch and kept stalling, decided he could not get on the freeway. Went to a park that was open air drug market, slept in the park from 6 pm to 2 am and awoke with rat bites on arms\nPeter’s residency story #2: He took an extra shift to cover for someone else.

Peter’s guess is that the cultural norm in those countries has a different mentality towards handing off patients. Overnight change of rule didn’t work in US because people in charge did not train under those rules and did not know what it meant to hand off a patient in those conditions\n\nToo important not to change\n\n“We’ve been able to put people on the moon, and that was non-trivial, but we solved it. I think we can also probably solve continuity of care, and protect both patient and doctor alike.”\n“I don’t mean to trivialize the problem…I really appreciate how hard that is…but what I would also love to try and just make sure that we don’t lose sight of the end outcome here…rather than get perhaps distracted by how difficult the problem is.”\n\nThe sleep needs of children, the travesty of early school start times, electronics at night, and advice for parents [1:04:45]\n“We will look back in probably 20 years with shame that we were having schools start at 7:30 in the morning.”\n\nMatthew argues that school starts way to early which is impacting the sleep of children\nHe understands that it is very difficult change to make with buses, parent work schedules, etc. \nBut urges that we don’t lose sight of end outcome; it’s a very difficult problem but still needs to be solved – there’s too much on the line\n\nEvidence\nWhen you delay school start times:\n\nGrades improve and attendance improves according to a Seattle study\nBehavior problems drop\nLife expectancy up due to reduced car crashes\n\nChanged school start time from 7:35 am to 8:55 am start time change\nCar accidents dropped 70% among 16-18 year olds",
