It is the common thread that links all of these chronic diseases.”\nHowever, on mortality tables, it doesn’t really show up individually as a huge source of death.\n\n3 | Vascular component to Alzheimer’s disease\n\nThis is a huge component\nSee podcast with Francisco Gonzalez-Lima for more on this\n\n4 | Inflammatory component to Alzheimer’s disease\n\nEnormous component, says Peter\n\n5 | Toxins related to Alzheimer’s disease\n\n“There’s almost assuredly a component that revolves around toxins and other things like that.”\n\nBlood tests for the deterministic genes:\n\nYou can test for the deterministic genes pretty easily (PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP)\nHowever, that’s usually just to confirm a strong suspicion after seeing a strong family history of getting AD\nHistory of AD:\n\nAlois Alzheimer diagnosed the first patient\nIt was a woman in her 50s that had early onset AD and she most likely had one of the deterministic genes\n“And this could be a real tragic case of medical history that our entire understanding of a disease, which is predicated on this incident case, has nothing to do with 99% of the diseases that people actually get.”\n\n\n\nThe punchline when it comes to Alzheimer’s disease: \n\nWe get pretty darn good information from the blood\nWe get the relevant genes\nWe get all the vascular stuff\nWe get all the metabolic stuff\nWe can’t get as much good info about the inflammatory stuff\nAnd we’re pretty bad at getting the toxins because truthfully we just don’t know\n\n“But overall we get a pretty darn good way to handicap someone’s risk of Alzheimer’s disease.” ",
