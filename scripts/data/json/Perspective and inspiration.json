So we’re back to square one on form.\nI’ve told her she needs to do 500/week of bodyweight squats, and once she hits about 10,000, she might be ready to do some light goblet squats.\nAnyway, recently I was looking at Twitter and saw this video. Some of you may have seen it, also.\nI said, “Hey Olivia, I want to show you something,” and she came over. I said, “What do you notice about this?”\nOlivia: She’s a girl?\nMe: And?\nOlivia: She’s young?\nMe: And?\nOlivia: She’s strong?\nMe: AND???\nOlivia: Oh my god….\nMe: Please don’t ever complain about me asking you to do 500 squats per week with your bodyweight on two good legs. Deal?\nOlivia: Deal.",
