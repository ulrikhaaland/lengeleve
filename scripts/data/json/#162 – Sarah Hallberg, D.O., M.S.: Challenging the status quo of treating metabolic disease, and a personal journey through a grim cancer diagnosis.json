As such we’ve decided to republish her episode on April 3, 2022 to honor her, her amazing work, and her courageous cancer journey.\n\nSarah Hallberg was the Medical Director at Virta Health and a physician who spent nearly two decades treating patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. \nIn the first half of this episode, Sarah discusses how she became a huge believer in the efficacy of carbohydrate restriction for the treatment of type 2 diabetes through her research and clinical experience. Sarah challenges the common beliefs about the role of dietary fat and carbohydrate on the plasma makeup of fatty acids and triglycerides. She also expresses the importance of understanding early predictors of metabolic illness—highlighting one particular fatty acid as the most important early predictor—before finishing with a discussion about how doctors might be able to personalize patients’ metabolic management in the future.\nIn the second half of this episode, Sarah tells the personal story of her own lung cancer diagnosis (skip to the second part of her episode on youtube here). She talks about dealing with her grief, deciding to continue her work while prioritizing her family, and how she devised a plan to extend her survival as long as possible.\n\nSubscribe on: APPLE PODCASTS | RSS | GOOGLE | OVERCAST | STITCHER\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t#162 - Sarah Hallberg, D.O., M.S.: Challenging the status quo of treating metabolic disease, and a personal journey through a grim cancer diagnosis\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Peter Attia Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#162 - Sarah Hallberg, D.O., M.S.: Challenging the status quo of treating metabolic disease, and a personal journey through a grim cancer diagnosis\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t#162 - Sarah Hallberg, D.O., M.S.: Challenging the status quo of treating metabolic disease, and a personal journey through a grim cancer diagnosis\n\t\t\t\t         \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tmore\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 50%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 75%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Normal\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 125%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 150%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: 175%\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Double\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n  Speed: Triple\n  \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Back 15 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n  Forward 60 seconds\n  \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nCurrently Playing\n\n\t\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n  Download\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n  More\n  \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nWe discuss:\n\nHow Sarah discovered the profound impact of carbohydrate restriction for reversing obesity and type 2 diabetes [3:15];\nPrediabetes and metabolic syndrome: prevalence, early signs, and the importance of treating early [16:00];\nOverview of fatty acids, how they are metabolized, and understanding what you see in a standard blood panel [29:15];\nThe relationship between diet composition and metabolic markers [35:15];\nWhy palmitoleic acid is such an important biomarker [48:15];\nThe best early indicators of metabolic disease [1:00:00];\nPersonalized management of metabolic illness [1:07:00];\nSarah’s cancer diagnosis and the beginning of her journey [1:15:15];\nThe emotional impact of a devastating diagnosis [1:27:15];\nSarah’s plan to extend survival [1:36:45];\nSarah’s aggressive treatment plan [1:47:30];\nLife-threatening complications and the return of her cancer [1:59:00];\nSarah’s reflections on her approach to life with chronic cancer and balancing her time [2:11:00];

It was astronomical, hundreds of units of insulin.”   \nMost clinic patients had some kind of metabolic disease and T2DM was the most common \n\n\nTo get institutional support for the clinic, she gave presentations to all the departments in the med center explaining the scientific evidence behind carb restriction\n\nSurprisingly, she got no pushback\neven got fellow members of the ambulatory quality committee to unanimously pass an amendment saying that all patients with metabolic disease should at least be provided the option of trying a low carb diet\n\n\n\n“As we were seeing these huge changes of … patients just resolving their diabetes, I became really angry because I was like, ‘Where is this? Where’s this in the guidelines? How come I’ve never heard of this before?’ I mean, I hate to be overdramatic, but it truly is quite miraculous for a disease that everyone thought was chronic and progressive, to see people recover from it is quite astounding.” —Sarah Hallberg\nEarly studies by Sarah\n\nConducted an early unfunded study of metabolic improvements with carb restriction\n\nAlso looked at economic advantages because not requiring medication saves money for both the individual and the healthcare system as a whole (expanded on in a later paper)\n\n\nSarah has discussed the results of her research at the National Lipid Association and in a popular TED Talk that has been viewed more than 7 million times\nShe met Steve Phinney at a meeting of the Obesity Medicine Association, which “really changed the course of my life”\n\nPeter has been trying to get Steve on the podcast \nPeter reached out to Steve when he began implementing some of the low carb principles\nPeter had a pre-print copy of Steve and Jeff’s 2011 book The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living (“which might have more highlights and post-its in it than any book I own”)\n\n\nLike Sarah, he kept thinking it couldn’t be true because it seems counterintuitive\n\n ",

That means there’s been a problem for a long time already.” says Sarah\n\nPeter has male prediabetic patients who, after their blood glucose comes down by an average of 10 mg/dL, will say they have better erections \n\nThis shows that microvascular damage occurs long before you meet the criteria for diabetes\n\n\nPeter says HbA1c is far too crude a metric for metabolic disease\n\nLooking at microvasculature in the eye might be a good screening tool for disease because it’s one of the earliest warning signs\nBetter to use an individualized metric rather than population-based guidelines that can be misleading in an individual\n\n\nSarah says a key question is if can intervene at that early stage to make it better and allow patients to avoid diabetes-related eye disease\n\n \nOverview of fatty acids, how they are metabolized, and understanding what you see in a standard blood panel [29:15]\nOverview of fatty acids\n\nDiving into the “nerdy” science of fatty acids, which Peter has discussed on his podcast many times before\n\nSaturated fats: no double bonds, every carbon fully saturated with hydrogen\nMonounsaturated fats: have one and only one double bond (un-saturation)\nPolyunsaturated fats: at least two double bonds\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Chemical Structures of fatty acid types. Image credit: Näak\nC16 saturated fat\n\nWhat’s interesting is that you can ingest one form and turn it into another\nThe PRC16 saturated fat palmitoleic acid is a very common one in the human body\nPeter wants to discuss: What is the fate of this very common fat found in our body?\n\nSaturated fatty acids in general\n\nWhen saturated FAs are incorporated into TGs, correlated with insulin resistance and adiposity (fat)\nLikely due to an increase in the liver making lipids on its own (de novo lipogenesis) and to an increasing amount of lipids coming back to the liver\n\n\nFigure 2. Increased VLDL saturated FA content, insulin resistance, and de novo lipogenesis. Image courtesy of Sarah Hallberg\n\nSeems like a high amount of saturated FAs in TGs would suggest an increase in saturated FA consumption\n\n“And this is the problem with a lot of things in science in general, and nutrition science is no different, is that just because it seems to make sense doesn’t mean it’s the way things actually work.” —Sarah Hallberg\nPeter clarifies a technical point…\n\nIn a standard blood panel, VLDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol add up to the total cholesterol, but TGs are independent \nThese amounts are all found within the lipoproteins: \n\nVLDL cholesterol is the amount of cholesterol ester contained within the very low density lipoproteins, \nLDL cholesterol is the total content of cholesterol ester found within the low density lipoproteins, etc.\nCheck these values after patient has fasted because we want to eliminate what’s in the chylomicron and the immediately absorbed triglyceride from the gut\n\n\nWhen we measure a triglyceride, for all intents and purposes, we are basically measuring the 90% of triglycerides that are captured within the VLDL \n\nIf your TGs are 150 mg/dL, 90% of that 150 mg/dL is within your VLDL cholesterol (small amount in virtually nonexistent IDLs and trace amounts in LDL and HDL)\nWhen fat is made in the liver (de novo lipogenesis) and then exported, the conduit is the VLDL particle\n\n\n\n \nThe relationship between diet composition and metabolic markers [35:15]\nThe next important question: If there is a high saturated fatty acid content within the TGs in the VLDL, is it from consumption?\nLooking at studies to help us answer this question:\n\nIn a study by Brittanie Volk, researchers provided all food to subjects with metabolic syndrome so they could keep track of exactly what they were eating\nStudy had six feeding phases\n\nfirst was < 50 g carbs/day with 84 g of saturated fat (which “blows away any guideline”)\nEvery three weeks they increased the carbohydrates in the diet\nIn 6th feeding phase, 346 g carbs/day with 32 g of saturated fat\nSubjects ate the same amount of calories per day in each phase (isocaloric)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The six feeding phases used in the Volk study. Image credit: Volk et al. 2014\n\nFound that the saturated fatty acid content increased over the feeding phases\nIt was actually higher with the lower saturated fat intake\n\n\nFigure 4. Cumulative changes in (A) body mass and fat mass, (B) fasting lipoproteins, (C) insulin resistance, and (D) blood pressure in feeding phase study subjects. Image credit: Volk et al. 2014\n\nFigure 5. Plasma fatty acid responses across feeding phases. Image courtesy of Sarah Hallberg (adapted from Volk et al. 2014)\n\nThe increases in C14 and C16-1 were statistically significant\nDid not have high levels of serum saturated fatty acids when these participants were consuming a high saturated fat diet\n\nNo increase – remained about the same with a trend to higher serum saturated fat in the low fat phase\nYou are NOT what you eat\nFatty acids are stored in the TGs, cholesterol esters, and phospholipids\nPeter notes that “regardless of where you look, you see no association between dietary saturated fat and fatty acid composition with respect to saturated fat”\n\n\nC16-1 is palmitoleic acid, which significantly rises when there is less saturated fat and more carbohydrates (refer to table above)\n\nAnother trial in 2008 had similar results (41:45)\n\nComposition of diets\n\nCompared low saturated fat diet to a low carbohydrate, high saturated fat diet over 12 weeks\n12 g saturated fat a day vs. 36 g with the low carb diet\nBoth were restricted to ~1500 calories a day\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Composition of diets in the 2008 study. Image courtesy of Sarah Hallberg (based on data from Forsythe et al. 2008)\n\nShowed a significant decrease in saturated FAs with the low carb diet\n\nWas also a drop in the low saturated fatty acid intake group\nbut not nearly as much of a drop as with the carbohydrate restricted group \n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. A low-carbohydrate, high-SFA diet decreases serum SFA levels. Image courtesy of Sarah Hallberg (based on data from Forsythe et al. 2008)\n\nPalmitic vs. palmitoleic acid\n\nPalmitic acid is C16:0 \nPalmitoleic is C16:1n-7 \nThey look almost the same except that palmitoleic acid has a double bond at the end seven position \n\n\nPalmitoleic acid (16:1) is not a saturated FA, but it’s still important here\n\nin the high saturated fatty acid group, it drops significantly, whereas in the low saturated fatty acid group, it actually increases\neven more statistically significant than the change in the serum fatty acids\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Palmitoleic acid decreases with a high SFA diet and increases with a low SFA diet. Image courtesy of Sarah Hallberg (based on data from Forsythe et al. 2008)\n\nLooking at the results below (very low carbohydrate arm on the left and the low fat arm on the right):\n\ntotal saturated fatty acids dropped 5% between the low carbohydrate group and the low fat group\nbetween the low carbohydrate and low fat diets, a more significant decrease in palmitoleic acid with the low carbohydrate higher fat diet \nboth of these groups of patients started out with quite elevated triglycerides\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Comparison of changes in SFA levels between a high-SFA and low-SFA diet. Image courtesy of Sarah Hallberg (based on data from Forsythe et al. 2008)\n\nIn the very low carbohydrate diet group:\n\naverage triglyceride at the start of this study was ~211 mg/dL (very high)\nAt the end of 12 weeks, decreased to ~104 mg/dL, so fell by about 50%\n\n\nIn the low fat diet group:\n\naverage triglyceride at the start of this study was ~187 mg/dL (also very high)\nAt the end of 12 weeks, decreased to ~150 mg/dL, so fell by about 20%\n\n\nFor 16.0:\n\nboth groups saw a slight reduction, but it was statistically more significant in one group than the other\nThe low carb group had a 12% reduction versus 5% in the low fat group\nThe difference was even greater because the low carb group also had a significant reduction in total TGs, where the FAs are\n\n\nThe reverse was true for 16:1:\n\nthe low carbohydrate arm decreased more in the triglycerides\nBut the low fat arm decreased too even though we associate low fat with an increase in TGs\nIn this study the subjects’ diet was restricted to about ~1500 calories / day, so the drop in the low fat group makes sense in this context\n\n\n\n \nWhy palmitoleic acid is such an important biomarker [48:15]\nThe role of palmitoleic acid in fat metabolism\n",

Variation of plasma triglyceride across quartiles of palmitoleic acid levels. Image credit: Paillard et al. 2007\n\nOne of the first steps in the conversion of fatty acids is the conversion of palmitic acid into palmitoleic acid\n\nenzyme that converts it is SCD1 (also known as delta-9 desaturase because it de-saturates the number nine carbon from the delta end)\nit is bundling and packaging fat to leave the liver\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Structures of palmitic and palmitoleic acids. Image credit: Metagenics\n\nWhy is the body converting serum saturated fats into something else? \n\nseems counterintuitive \nsaturated fat seems safer because it’s inert, so there’s no chance a reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be formed out of it\nwhy would the liver convert the fat before exporting it?\n\n\nNutrition recommendations have been low fat and high carbohydrates for so long\nAs carbs are absorbed in the intestine as glucose, feed into the pancreas through glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), and the pancreas produces more insulin\n\nInsulin feeds into the liver via SREBP-1, SCD1 increases\nFructose also comes in through GLUT5, glucose through GLUT2\nThey’re all feeding into this by slightly different mechanisms to increase SCD1\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Liver processing of carbohydrates. Image credit: University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Biochemistry\n\nAnother way to look at it:\n\nHave increased levels of palmitic acid in the liver\nGet increased SCD1 activity, which increases POA and ultimately VLDL\nIf block SCD1, decrease POA and VLDL\n\n\nWhen you consume high carb diet, this pathway is activated, elevating saturated fat and ultimately VLDL\nIf liver is taking in palmitic acid, first step is to go through SCD1, which adds a double bond\n\nUltimately increases lipogenesis\nincreasing the amount of lipid within cholesteryl ester and TG and exporting from the liver\nIs protective in a sense because the liver is likely trying to export as much fat as it can and TGs are an efficient place to store it\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13. The effect of SCD-1 on lipid metabolism. Image courtesy of Sarah Hallberg (adapted from Paton & Ntambi 2008)\n\nWhen exceed export capacity of liver, develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is “truly an epidemic at the moment”\nPeter believes that obesity is a protective mechanism: “I think that obesity is not the cause of metabolic illness, but the result of it”\n\nObesity-induced inflammation is a problem too\nBut Peter thinks that “everything we’re talking about here is the body’s aim to protect itself from an abundance of nutrition”\n\nLiver is making too much extra fat because carb consumption exceeds the body’s tolerance\nMost efficient response is to turn carbs into fat and send it via VLDL to the adipose tissue\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe best early indicators of metabolic disease [1:00:00]\n\nSarah points out that, given this process, it would be ideal to know what each individual’s carb tolerance level is \n\nLow carb works at population level, but want to tailor it to each individual\nIncreasing POA might be the marker that indicates when someone has consumed carbohydrates above their individual tolerance\n\n\nPOA changes occur before someone becomes obese\n\n“It’s so important for other providers to be looking at themselves in the mirror and asking themselves, ‘What are the biases I hold against patients who come to me struggling with their weight? And what do I really know about the science?’ And what really one must conclude is that this is not their fault.” —Sarah Hallberg\n\nObesity is a very visible consequence of things that already occurred\nIt makes patients vulnerable to bias in healthcare and is part of our battle for health equity\nPeter says it’s really problematic that we’re using an HbA1c > 6.5 as the marker of when someone starts being closely followed medically\n\n“that literally is happening 10, 15, maybe 20 years after there were early, early molecular warning signs”\nWe need to figure out how to use other, earlier markers like palmitoleic acid\n\n\nIn Peter’s practice he uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in non-diabetics to hold them to a very high standard\nThe extent of the association between palmitoleic acid and TGs on African American patients is not well understood; we don’t know if they fail to synthesize C16-1 the way white patients do because there has not been a good trial\n\n“One of the problems that we have in research in general is that we tend to focus on white people. And actually, worse, middle or upper middle class white people. So there are a lot of questions with this in specific populations.” —Sarah Hallberg\n\nThere are some studies coming out looking at POA as a predictor for future diabetes and other problems\n\nA paper from the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children (PANIC) study looked at POA in children to see if it indicated future health problems\nAnother study found that POA levels at age 50 correlated with C-reactive protein levels at age 70\nData show that POA is a predictor of future medical problems even in people who were healthy when their POA was elevated\n\n\nIt’s obviously important to work with patients to help them reverse their disease, but would be even better to identify patients at high risk for future disease while they’re still healthy to help them stay that way\n\n \nPersonalized management of metabolic illness [1:07:00]\nPeter’s approach\n\nPeter says he thinks “the future of medicine has to be coming up with tools that allow us to take broad sweeping population-based insights and very quickly target individuals”\n\nUse early biomarkers to figure out when to intervene even if glucose and insulin are still normal\nThe key is to figure out the right intervention for each individual patient\n\n\nBoth Peter and Sarah have found that patients with hyperinsulinemia and elevated glucose generally respond well to carbohydrate restriction\n\nIn his practice, Peter focuses on the role of glucose disposal and non-insulin-dependent glucose disposal through exercise\nSleep, exercise, and nutrition are key, as is understanding the role of cortisol\n\n\nPeter says, “I think the good news is if you get this one right, you get a leg up on every chronic disease. So your risk of heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, all go down. And so it’s worth this enormous effort to continue pushing on these questions”\n\nSarah’s approach\n\nRestricting carbs to low levels can reverse the disease process, restoring normal glycemia and getting patients off of medications\nBut if widely use markers like POA, might not have to do as much restriction in some patients\n\nIt’s much better than telling everyone they have to eat very few carbs indefinitely\nSarah has seen patients who spent years on ketogenic / very low carbohydrate diets who were able to gradually re-introduce some amount of carbohydrate back in the diet without metabolic problems\nAfter have reversed diabetes, can slowly reintroduce carbohydrates as long as they have functioning β-cells\n\n\nAre some β-cells only dormant while others are permanently destroyed?\n\nWe don’t completely understand this yet; seems like sometimes after a period of resetting the system can get functioning β-cells again\nWould be ideal to be able to tell individuals how many dormant vs. dead β-cells they have to set realistic expectations (e.g., one will eventually get off insulin, another will not)\n\n\nSomeone with no insulin production capacity can still get a lot healthier even if they can’t get off insulin\n\nNot yet known why some people can start to eat some carbs again (though not anywhere near what they used to) and others cannot\nbut the answer seems to be related to β-cell function\n\n\nPeter thinks patients need to understand that insulin, “while an amazing and important hormone, is not benign”\n\nReducing the amount if insulin you need is always an improvement, even if you can’t come completely off of it\nEven without considering economic advantages, still a huge advantage to reducing the negative effects of hyperinsulinemia\n\n\nDiabetes management leads to more and more insulin \n\nPeople gain more weight when they go on more insulin\nNeed to tell patients that, although they need to take insulin to avoid complications, hospitalization, and death from too high blood sugar levels, they are more likely to die on insulin\n\n\n“That would have changed the approach a lot of patients want to take, and if providers were forced to look at it that way when they’re staring each individual person in the face, maybe they would treat it differently as well”\n\n \nSarah’s cancer diagnosis and the beginning of her journey [1:15:15]\n\nPeter and Sarah met through Virta, a company which is scaling up a way to treat patients with T2DM remotely\n\nVirta was founded by Steve Phinney, Jeff Volek, [and Sami Inkinen] in 2014\nSarah is the Medical Director at Virta and Peter is a small investor and at one point he was an advisor\nAbout a month after seeing Sarah looking healthy at an advisory meeting in June 2017, Peter heard that she had been diagnosed with cancer\n\n\n\n“I’ve been someone who’s taken care of themselves to the max all my life; eaten well, I’ve kept my weight at a normal weight. Even nine months pregnant, I would have still been considered normal weight. Exercised like crazy, competed in half marathons, triathlons, Olympic distance. I did everything right. Never smoked, never drank to excess.” —Sarah Hallberg\n\nOn June 30th, 2017, Sarah was on a business call when suddenly she couldn’t talk\n\nEnded up in the trauma bay of the hospital where she works\nIt brought up bad memories of the time her daughter was there for a traumatic brain injury (although her daughter fully recovered)\n\n\nFound a large brain tumor and multiple tumors in her chest, had urgent brain surgery the next day\nSarah was being irrational because she had always been healthy and taken good care of herself and could not believe this was happening to her\n\nSarah had treated patients with lung cancer and knew that it meant suffering\nhad the thought that she should move to Oregon because physician-assisted suicide is legal there and she wanted to spare her family\nHer cancer had widely spread and was Stage IV even she had exercised and felt fine the day before\nShe was concerned about her family watching her suffer and wanted them to remember her as she was\n\n\n“Cancer changes you. So I’m not that person. One of the many things is sometimes, at this point in time, I mourn that person, because I liked her”\n12 to 14% of people who get lung cancer are not smokers\nLung cancer is broadly divided histologically into two types\n\nSmall cell carcinoma\nNon-small cell carcinoma, of which there are 3 subtypes:\n\nLarge cell carcinoma\nAdenocarcinoma\nSquamous cell carcinoma\n\n\nmany non-smokers who get lung cancer have have the adenocarcinoma type of non-small cell carcinoma\n\n\ngiven the prevalence and lethality, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women than any other cancer by far\nStage IV means that a cancer has spread from its original location\n\nin Sarah’s case it spread to the brain (“a particularly devastating place for this cancer to grow”)\nmedian expected survival is around 8 to 12 months\n\n\nLung cancer in non-smokers is increasing at an alarming rate\n\nHits people in their prime and is more common in Caucasian and Asian women\nIt also seems to affect people who are thin or athletic for unknown reasons\nIt’s odd that it’s impacting a population “who have presumably done everything right” and thus might think they are not at risk\nNeeds a lot more publicity beyond one article that was published in The Guardian\n\n\nPatients tend to have either epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven cancer or echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) positive cancer\n\nSarah has the EGFR type, specifically the exon 19 mutation:\n\n\n\n",

The colored circles represent amino acids.  Exon 19 is a section of the gene that codes for EGFR amino acids 729-761.  Here the amino acids in the red box are missing as a result of the gene mutation.\n\nfor cancer driven by EGFR, you can target therapy with a class of medications called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)\n\n\nFigure 15. Action of TKIs. Image credit: Vanderbilt University Center for Knowledge Management. The circle on the left represents a normal cell.  The circle on the right illustrates how a TKI (erlotinib) prevents EGFR from turning on other proteins and pathways, thus reducing cancer cell growth.\n\nThese drugs do not cure the cancer (it always comes back), but they can make it go into remission\n\n \nThe emotional impact of a devastating diagnosis [1:27:15]\n\nSarah’s brain mass had to be removed because of the seizure risk, but they did not remove the tumors from her lungs\nAs she recovered from the brain surgery she felt “overwhelming grief to the point of not being able to think”\nas a mom she thought about it through the lens of what it would mean for her children, who were 7, 12, and 14 at the time and needed her \n\n“And so the grief is overwhelming … What I quickly realized is, I’m going to break my children’s heart and there’s not a thing I can do about it. And to have that realization, because it comes quick and have to sit with that, is a grief I can’t even explain.” —Sarah Hallberg\n\nShe was in denial and walked 7 miles the day she was discharged from the ICU to prove that she was healthy\nShe found out later that her kids had discovered her in the basement, so there was no option not to tell them\n\nAll kids go through a stage of worrying that something will happen to their parents, and now their mom has been diagnosed with advanced cancer\nSarah and her husband decided to always tell the kids the truth so they wouldn’t be worried that they would suddenly get terrible news\nKids mostly chose not to discuss it, but the lines of communication were kept open\n\n\n“Over time, in grief, you learn to accept many things”\n\nShe had her husband dreamed of retiring to a farm and had joked about wanting to die instantly in a car crash at an old age\nShe could accept things like that she wasn’t going to retire, “but you can’t accept that you’re not going to be a mom. Impossible”\n\n\nPeter’s practice recently had a situation where a patient had been advised to have a major, risky surgery that was unnecessary \n\n“And we realized, the asymmetry of knowledge in medicine is so overwhelming that it’s not even just about money or education outside of medicine. A smart person still has a hard time digesting medical literature”\n\n\nSarah’s case really comes down to how to treat her specific mutation\nSarah was able to, as Peter puts it, “partition her grief and problem solving brains” and go back and forth between them\nYou have to accept that it’s terminal, but you can also ask what you can do to control when it’s terminal\n\nShe understood that she would not have a normal life expectancy\nShe was 46 at the time, and first she hoped to make it to 50\nNow her 50th birthday is approaching and she wants to make it 11 years when her youngest child will graduate\n\n\n\n \nSarah’s plan to extend survival [1:36:45]\n\nShe tried to figure out a path for extending her survival\n\nNeed primary tumor out but she’s considered inoperable\nTKIs work well but only for a short period of time\n\non average 8 months, longest would be 24-30 months\nincreases the risk of mutation and the tumor becoming resistant to TKIs\n\n\nHer largest tumor was 6 cm, which is very large (but asymptomatic in her case)\nUsually do not operate on patients with metastatic cancer (the brain is an exception because could save her life acutely)\n\n\nThe TKI eliminated all of her small tumors within weeks \nTwo remaining tumors in her brain were treated with stereotactic radiation\n\nSarah did not have nausea from the radiation, but she did have side effects from the TKIs\nSpecialists were surprised by her unusual reactions, like losing all her hair when that doesn’t typically happen with TKIs\n\n\nFound a surgeon who would take out the primary tumor in her lung to decrease the risk of developing a mutation that would keep her from responding to the TKIs\n\nRight lung has 3 lobes that drain into lymph nodes into an area called the mediastinum \n\n\n\n\nFigure 16. The lungs and mediastinum. Image credit: WNY Urology\n\nPlanned to take out her right upper lobe, but she knew there was also a possibility that it had spread to the mediastinum\nIf the surgeon found that any of those lymph nodes contained cancer, it would be futile because it had already escaped the lung\nSo Sarah knew that there was a chance she could wake up with a huge scar and chest tubes but the cancer still there, and that’s what happened\nShe doesn’t remember, but in recovery she was hysterically crying that she was a mom and this couldn’t happen to her\n\n\nWas depressed but would not give up\nWent back to work at the clinic the same month she had brain surgery\nA few weeks before her diagnosis, she had been selected to be an Aspen Health Innovator Fellow as an innovator in the healthcare\n\nHad committed to four weeks of leadership sessions over the next two years\nWondered why she was leaving her kids for a week when she had terminal cancer\nBut when she got on the plane, she decided her kids would be better off if she chose to go out and live instead of feeling sorry for herself\n\n\n\n“And so that was the moment, sitting on that plane seat, crying. … Deciding, I just chose to live. This was a moment, I made my choice now I got to stick with it. And that’s how I’ve tried to live my life since then. Because I had a platform, I had done what I feel was a lot of good for a lot of people and it wasn’t finished.” —Sarah Hallberg\n\nBefore her diagnosis, her family was joking that Sarah and her husband should buy lottery tickets so they could retire\nHer then-13-year-old son said, “‘You can’t retire, Mom, you’re doing so much good for the world. How could you even think of it?’ … That is a defining moment of my life. … That weighed heavily on my decision to get on that plane and to continue doing what I’m doing”\nShe is now focused even more on health equity after her experiences as a cancer patient who is privileged: “I didn’t realize the stark differences until I became a patient”\n\n \nSarah’s aggressive treatment plan [1:47:30]\n\nPeter doesn’t like language like “beat” cancer and “never give up” because it makes it sound like patients who don’t survive cancer somehow gave up\n\nIt’s not true and it doesn’t make sense\nHe likes Sarah’s framework of finding a way to co-exist with your cancer for as long as possible\n\n\nSarah has exceeded all odds and Peter wonders how she has stayed in equilibrium\nAfter her surgery, they found another brain tumor\nThe first-line TKI had failed\n\nShe was switched to the newest TKI, called osimertinib (Tagrisso), right before the first Aspen leadership conference\n\n\nAs a mother, she couldn’t accept just waiting for the cancer to come back, so she sought out very aggressive treatment\n\nShe knows she was lucky to have the means to travel around the country seeing different doctors\nMet another physician-mom with slightly younger kids who had the same “I refuse to accept this” attitude\n\nThey joined together and found a medical team with a new approach\n\n\n\n\nCurrent thinking is to put people on the highest dose possible of one thing, keep going until it doesn’t work anymore, then do the same with the next thing\nThe team’s new approach is to change up the treatment all the time to stay ahead of mutations \n\nIn February 2019 she went through the regular cycles of chemo\nBegan anti-estrogen therapy immediately after finishing the chemo\nBesides the EGFR mutation, she had a very specific mutation for which there was a breast cancer medication (palbociclib), because the mutation was the same for both\nput into early menopause with medications like Lupron and fulvestrant and then started palbociclib\nremained on Tagrisso / Osimertinib throughout her treatment\nafter 8 weeks of palbociclib went on a single agent, low-dose chemo called cisplatin\n\nshe was tired and nauseous all the time but learned to manage\n\n\n\n\nShe continued to travel for work (“I could tell you some really crazy stories of things I had to do while traveling to accommodate how I was feeling that nobody knew about at the time”)\nafter 8 weeks of cisplatin she switched to gemcitabine (Gemzar), which is used in both lung and pancreatic cancer\nthere is no standard chemo regimen for lung cancer, and nothing she tried was outlandish\nShe had radiation on her primary lung tumor\n\nTagrisso had stopped shrinking her primary tumor in March 2018, almost a year before she began chemo \nSince it couldn’t be surgically removed, it was irradiated\nUnlike the brain radiation, she did not tolerate the lung radiation well\n\nShe had bad chest pain a day or two before leaving on a trip to hike the Inca trail\nShe decided not to tell anyone because “what a better place to die, than surrounded by your family on the Inca trail in all the beauty of the Andes mountains”\nThe trip was an amazing experience for her family\n\n\nHer family returned home and she went on to Switzerland for a conference, where the pain started to get really bad and felt crushing\n\nShe was having a rare complication that impacted her bones\nbut she declined treatment because the only option was long-term opioid therapy\n\n\nBut after radiation she had no evidence of disease (NED) for a long time\n\n\n\n \nLife-threatening complications and the return of her cancer [1:59:00]\nLife-threatening complications from Gemzar\n\nConventional wisdom says that Gemzar is easy compared to Cisplatin\n\nbut Sarah had the opposite experience\nShe once threw up in a plant in her yard as she left for chemo\n\n\nWent to a conference in San Francisco and felt too short of breath to walk\nThe day after she flew home she went in for chemo but her liver and kidney numbers were sky high and she had pancytopenia\n\nNormal hemoglobin is 13 or 14, hers was in the low sixes, so she was severely anemic\nHer platelets were 23, which means her blood was not able to clot\n\n\nSent her home from chemo, but her physician friends admitted her\n\nshe had a thoracentesis to drain all the fluid from around her lungs that was making her short of breath  \nTransferred to the ICU in the hospital\nWas put on BiPap (a kind of ventilator)\n\n\nHad multiorgan failure (respiratory, liver, kidney) caused by the Gemzar\nShe got great care and a year later she has no persistent failures even though she was near death\nSarah was in the ICU for a long time\n\nShe was on plasmapheresis and had atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), an immune system disorder with which over 70% of patients either quickly die or are on dialysis\nshe had kidney biopsies, was put on a new medication, did outpatient plasmapheresis, and significantly improved\nshe got infusions every 8 weeks, so no one would put her back on chemo\n\n\nPharmacogenomics: using a patient’s genetic profile to predict their response to different drugs\n\nSarah had her genes analyzed and discovered that she had a genetic mutation that didn’t allow her body to break down Gemzar\nIf you get aHUS from Gemzar, it’s typical after months of treatment, but she got it within 4 weeks\nHer dose was like a megadose for her because she couldn’t clear it\n\n\n\nThe return of her cancer [2:05:45]\n\nCancer came back a year later, in September 2020\n\n“Here I am, a physician, able to grasp really difficult concepts, able to read and scour the literature and know what I’m looking for. Able to call … any time, someone to help me sort through something I didn’t understand or help maybe refer me to someone, I had all the resources in the world. … By the time I was diagnosed with cancer, I was an expert patient advocate, expert, hardcore. One of the other advantages I had is it didn’t take much to switch that and to … advocate for myself.” —Sarah Hallberg\n\nGot into a clinical trial on December 30, four months after cancer recurred\n\nAt the time this seemed like forever, but later she realized many without her advantages would die during that time",
