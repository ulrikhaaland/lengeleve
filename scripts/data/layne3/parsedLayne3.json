Afterwards when he feels good after a meet is the most dangerous because he tends to go right back into training. The smart thing to do is take some time to train for fun, keep that core strength, but move  towards accessory movements and things that don’t beat you up so much for several months. Then you could re-enter more of a building/ accumulation phase. Where the volume is going up, but the weights still aren’t super heavy. In those last 3 months, at the end of his training in preparation for competition, he ramps up to more heavy weights. He’s mostly hitting heavy singles.",

The 3rd thing that stands out is muscle mass. But when you look at the data, you realize muscle mass is tightly associated with strength. For listeners whose eyes are sort of glazing over as they talk about powerlifting, it’s worth pointing out that even if you never do a heavy squat, heavy bench press, or heavy deadlift, you have to be strong. These associations show up over and over again in studies. They use measures like grip strength, bench press, leg extension. It becomes important for people to understand how to train for power. Layne notes, “The principles are pretty much the same, it’s just the level to which they’re applied.

Layne was at a powerlifting meet where they had a Tendo unit on the bar and were measuring bar velocity as they asked them to rate their RPE after each attempt. They found that RPE, as validated by velocity data, was a pretty good measure in that population of powerlifters, because they’ve taken so many sets near failure. Layne’s summary: “You do need some experience going really hard and really close to failure. But once you have that experience and you understand what that feels like, then you can estimate better. You’re probably better off staying a few reps shy of failure and accumulating volume that way, just because going to failure is just so incredibly fatiguing.”",

  "content": "For a person who is not planning to go to a power meet, is there a need for them to go below four reps in training? Probably not, you can get plenty strong even doing sets of 10-15. Now you will not be as strong (even per cross-sectional area) as somebody who trains for strength, because strength is a specific skill. Layne’s best squat was 668 lbs. 6 months out from this, he was able to squat with added weight. But he has not added much more lean body mass. He was practicing the skill of a one rep max (which allowed him to do better on the one rep max). Mostly at 90% for singles, sometimes 95%. His RPE was 8-9. This teaches you how to grind through a lift. Interestingly, the more advanced somebody gets (in terms of strength), the slower their one rep max velocity will be. Research studies show this all the time, somebody who’s kind of new will come in, they will absolutely smoke a weight, then you put 5 lbs on, and they get stapled. Because they don’t have that grind capacity. They don’t know how to do it. Part of it may be psychological, but part of that’s probably physiological too. They haven’t trained their body to recruit all the fibers that it can get. Layne’s summary on strength: Lean body mass and strength are very closely tied together. But when it gets to those finer levels of strength, it’s kind of just practicing the actual one rep max. So when it comes to getting strong, you can absolutely get strong doing sets of 10, 15, because you’re increasing your lean body mass. Do you need to do sets of 3, 4? No. But don’t count them out because a lot of people actually just do really well with variety.",

It may provide a little bit better strength gains, but that’s probably just because people peak better when you’re periodizing things. People tend to like periodization better because they’re varying their repetition and are not as bored. “So you never want to poo poo the psychological effects of those things… Adherence is the most important thing.”‒ Layne Norton.

And we think the reason is each myonuclei can only control protein synthesis for a certain area. The muscle fiber can only grow as big as it has myonuclei. So the more myonuclei you can donate, the greater your potential is. One reason we think that men have more lean mass than women is during puberty hormonal difference emerge, and exposure to testosterone increase the number of myonuclei. This gives men a greater overall potential for lean mass. Up until puberty, males and females tend to have similar amounts of lean mass. So now when you talk about taking exogenous levels of testosterone, now you’re donating even more myonuclei, and so, you can reach a higher ceiling. Layne thinks this is the strongest argument against the crossover of transgender sports for people who were previously male but now identify as female, you can’t get rid of the long term benefit conveyed by the fusion of those myonuclei.

  "content": "Compare it muscle memory‒ if you have trained before but stop training, you can gain back muscle much faster than it takes to build it. This is true even for people who have stopped training for years. Animal study found muscle growth boosted by previous exposure to testosterone. There was a mouse study where they gave the animals testosterone and resistance trained them. One group received testosterone and the other did not. Both groups gained strength and lean mass, but the group getting testosterone gained more. Then they had a washout period, for a long as it took both groups to get back to their original lean mass number. They had both groups train again, without drugs in either group. The group that originally had testosterone gained muscle significantly faster than the other group. Our best understanding is it’s probably these myonuclei that got fused through that extra testosterone that confers that long-term benefit, and that’s how we think about max potential. Do we think that occurs only during a critical window of development, or does that happen if you’re 40 years old and you’re taking exogenous testosterone? We don’t really know because there’s no data on this. Layne speculates that if you have a certain level of testosterone through puberty and now you’re an adult and you maintain that as your natural state (you don’t get too obese or too underweight). You’ve probably fused the amount of myonuclei that you’re going to fuse (at least from testosterone). Now if you start taking testosterone exogenously, you’ve ramped that up another notch. And now you can fuse more myonuclei. Anecdotally, this would make sense because drug use in bodybuilding has continued to go up, up, up.

  "content": "Creatine (or phosphocreatine) can act as a high energy phosphate donor to regenerate ATP and allow you to perform better. Creatine is also a really powerful osmolite that pulls water into muscle tissue, which in and of itself may actually be anabolic. But regardless of the mechanism, we do know that when you take creatine, you see improvements in lean mass. If you look at anything that improves hypertrophy, a big portion of it is water. A more hydrated cell may be better able to carry out its function. So if the function of a myofibril is contractile, release, contract, release, and it has more water, it seems logical that it’s going to be better at clearing metabolic waste and recruiting fuel, which would at least be 2 things that would factor into its ability to do that.",

A recent meta-analysis showed that taking 5 g of creatine a day increases lean mass, strength, and performance. It's hard to compare taking creatine on lifting days versus non-lifting days, but the benefits come from accumulation, so it's key to saturate the muscle cell. Creatine loading can cause bad GI irritation, but it's a trade-off for faster saturation. There's no need to cycle creatine because there's no benefit to coming off as long as intramuscular levels of creatine are not falling.",

  "content": "If you’re going to press your dumbbells, one school of thought is to press them as quickly as possible. Because the mass is fixed, so any speed of lifting is acceleration because you’re moving against gravity. But the faster you can do it, the greater the force. At some point, the weight becomes so heavy that you increase the effort more on the mass variable than on the acceleration variable. So you can manipulate mass and acceleration to reach maximal force. An extreme example is a one-rep max. But as Layne pointed out earlier, the more elite a powerlifter becomes, the slower it is. So the emphasis is on mass, which is what you get scored on. How do we think about the mixing and matching of the mass versus the acceleration in an effort to optimize force? (on the concentric)",

  "people": "Layne Norton, Peter Attia",
  "content": "For hypertrophy, force is probably less important. It’s more about having enough sufficiently hard sets, however you slice that. The idea of time under tension training was very popular. In the initial research, one study had people doing curls, something around 6 second eccentric, 6 second concentric, to failure. Another group did the normal cadence and match the number of reps in the first group. They found the group doing slow eccentrics and concentrics gained more muscle. If you were going at a normal pace, how many times could you do 30% of a one-rep max (30, 40, 50)? A couple studies recently came out looking at fast eccentrics versus slow eccentrics and found there was a little bit better outcome with fast eccentrics with respect to muscle mass. See the selected links section at the end. Peter notes, “The only time I’ve ever done a fast eccentric is on my Exerfly machine because you’re forced to. It’s pulling you down so quickly that you’re screaming down and you’re coming to a stop. Outside of that it never occurred to me to do an eccentric quickly.” If he’s doing eccentric deadlifts, he’s trying to come down as slowly as possible, thinking that it is more time under tension. Layne thinks the time is part of the lift as well. You don’t want to take it too extreme and dive bomb a squat when there’s no tension on the bar. Consider a bicep curl. Have 2 people curl the same weight, using the same speed on their concentric. 1st person does a 2 sec concentric and 2 sec eccentric. 2nd person does a 2 sec concentric and a 6 sec eccentric. Will the 1st person produce more hypertrophy? Layne thinks it might be better. If you think about mechanical transduction and the force (the mechanical tension being applied to a muscle) when you’re getting to that point where the muscle is stopping and then having to come the other way, if it’s fast, that’s probably more tension at that specific point. So we just don’t know enough about this stuff right now to really be able to say for sure. But there is benefit from slow movements for people who have pain or don’t want to use a heavy weight.",

When you’re dealing with that super slow protocol, you’re kind of pushing a little bit more on that metabolic stress as opposed to the mechanical tension portion of it. But there still is mechanical tension. If you’re doing super slow, you might have a light weight, but you also have a really long time that you’re under that light weight accumulating metabolic stress and mechanical tensions.

Still, there was a 30 mg/dL reduction in total cholesterol in the low saturated fat group. Peter’s interpretation now is that a 2-year intervention is not long enough. The modifications you can make to cholesterol from diet (in some cases) can be quite small compared to what you can get with pharmaceutical interventions.",

There’s a precedent for this, a drug (triparanol) approved in the 60s lowered cholesterol but increased cardiovascular events (it was withdrawn). Ramsden proposes a series of mechanisms by which that might be the case with at least this polyunsaturated fat. Conversely, there is a lot of epidemiology that says the opposite, that whenever you substitute saturated for polyunsaturated fats, things get better.",

But you do have times when you have energy because you still have to train 2-3 hours a day. The part of contest prep Layne despises is he gets to a point where he doesn’t like training anymore. He continues with it for energy expenditure and to retain muscle. He loses his passion for it, and he’s somebody who loves to train (it’s his favorite thing in the world). He did periodize his nutrition so he would have some higher calorie days on days that were more demanding for training. These were usually lower body training days. As far as getting on stage, one thing he never cuts for bodybuilding shows is water. A lot of people cut water. Layne thinks this is silly because a muscle is 70% water and in your native state you keep more water inside your muscle cell than you do outside your muscle cell. If you begin removing more fluid via a diuretic or fluid restriction/ sodium restriction, you remove it in the same proportion from the subcutaneous layer and the intracellular layer. All you’re going to do is become flatter overall. In the intravascular layer, you get hypertensive. Not cutting water helped Layne with his energy. He was never dehydrated.
