  'Layne Norton holds a Ph.D. in nutritional sciences and is a physique coach, natural bodybuilder and powerlifter, and two-time previous podcast guest. In this episode, Layne discusses his training as a powerlifter and shares training principles that non-powerlifters can apply to improve muscle strength and mass. Layne goes in-depth on creatine supplementation, including the benefits for lean mass and strength, and addresses the common arguments against its regular usage. Additionally, Layne touches on many areas of nutrition, including how his opinions have changed on certain topics. Layne also touches on the subjects of protein, fiber, and fat in the diet, as well as the different tools and dietary approaches for energy restriction.\\\
You do all 3 squats go, then all 3 bench presses, then all 3 deadlifts\\\
The time between can vary\\\
The last time Layne did Worlds was in 2015, and that was a very, very fast meet\\\
That whole meet took just over 2 hours\\\
In his flight, there was only 11 people\\\
The person who has the lightest squat will go first up to the heaviest squat\\\
The same thing happens for the bench press and deadlift\\\
Layne has been at meets where it took as long as 3.5 hours\\\
 Usually you get at least 30 minutes between lifts \\\
They run it so there are no real breaks for spectators\\\
They’ll have 2 flights going at the same time\\\
While the other folks are lifting, you’re warming up and getting ready\\\
What do you do in between? Does it matter what you eat?  How do you maximize your odds?  \\\
Usually between the lifts (squat and bench press) we’ll have 30-60 minutes\\\
Between the actual attempts (1st, 2nd, & 3rd) themselves, Layne will take a drink of water or might eat some candy quickly if he feels like he needs it\\\
For the most part, he’s mentally trying to get himself in the right zone\\\
This is a little tricky, because you can’t keep yourself at that really high level of arousal the entire time\\\
It will wear you out\\\
The trick is to bring the arousal down for 5 minutes or so (to relax), and the start to focus back up\\\
It’s almost like a wave\\\
 Timing is a big thing because when they call “bar is loaded,” you have 1 minute to get the down command for squat or bench press or whatever it is\\\
There can be mistakes where you come out and forget your belt or something happens\\\
So when they say “bar is loaded”, he gets out there very quickly so that if there is anything wrong, so he can address it and still have time\\\
He likes to have 2-3 minutes to get very aroused and amped up\\\
He’ll do visualization and breath work in the last few minutes leading up to his lift\\\
He wants to have his heart rate around 160-170 by the time he goes out to hit his lift\\\
Peter wonders about his blood glucose, he imagines glucose output would be at its max\\\
Layne has never measured this\\\
Perception is important \\\
Layne notes, “Your stress hormones are going to be high… This is a little bit off topic, but I was listening to a sports psychologist talk about how the differences between excitement and anxiety and anxiousness, you can’t almost pick them out. It’s just your perception.” \\\
He relates it to watching an episode of The Ultimate Fighter many years ago where it was Matt Serra versus Matt Hughes\\\
And one of the fighters was vomiting before a match, because he was so nervous\\\
He was over the bucket going, “I can’t do this anymore. I hate the way this feels. I can’t do this.”\\\
And Matt Serra just looked at him and said, “What are you talking about, man? That’s the feeling of being alive. You care about something so much that your body is reacting this way.”\\\
That reframing of things and just accepting and being okay with the anxiety has helped Layne so much \\\
“Ever since then, it completely flipped the way I looked at competition… And now, when I feel those nerves start to kick in, I just tell myself  ‘this is a good thing, this is a good thing. This is your body getting you ready.’”‒ Layne Norton \\\
Have you ever injured yourself in a meet? \\\
Peter notes the stakes in powerlifting are really high and the meet is really short\\\
He wonders if the states are high from an injury standpoint, because you’re pushing at your limit\\\
Layne has not injured himself to the point where he had really bad pain or couldn’t continue\\\
But at the Arnold Pro Meet back in 2015, he aggravated his back pretty badly, a week out\\\
The day of the meet, when he hit his last squat (661 lbs), he rotated a little bit coming up and he could definitely feel it the next day\\\
It was closer to his upper lumbar or lower thoracic, he had a lot of pain there\\\
Typically don’t see people get injured at meets\\\
It does happen, but Layne guesses it’s less frequent than during training\\\
Peter notes the volume of exercise when training probably leaves your more fatigued\\\
Layne agrees\\\
If you’ve done your due diligence to get ready for a meet, hopefully, you’ve dissipated a lot of that fatigue through rest and tapering\\\
However, when you’re in the throes of training and you have high levels of fatigue, maybe you’re just not able to execute the lifts as well (because of that fatigue), and that’s where things tend to happen\\\
Especially if you’re doing multiple repetitions\\\
As you get close to the failure, there is the opportunity to get out of position or make mistakes\\\
Injury is definitely one of the things that is part of the game\\\
You’re going to deal with pain\\\
Layne always tells people “I’m 40 now, and most 40 year olds, 50 year olds, they have pain anyway. So I’d rather be strong and have pain than be weak and have pain.” \\\
How many times a year can you peak for a meet at the top level of powerlifting? \\\
Layne has done 1 per year and 4 per year (high level meets)\\\
4 is way too much\\\
He thinks the sweet spot for him is probably 2\\\
Really, it’s about getting to competition day with enough fitness level, in terms of being able to execute heavy lifts, while dissipating fatigue and being in low enough levels of pain that you can execute \\\
Afterwards when he feels good after a meet is the most dangerous because he tends to go right back into training\\\
The smart thing to do is take some time to train for fun, keep that core strength, but move  towards accessory movements and things that don’t beat you up so much for several months\\\
Then you could re-enter more of a building/ accumulation phase\\\
Where the volume is going up, but the weights still aren’t super heavy\\\
In those last 3 months, at the end of his training in preparation for competition, he ramps up to more heavy weights\\\
He’s mostly hitting heavy singles\\\
Training for strength: advice for beginners and non-powerlifters [13:15]\\\
What can the rest of us learn about strength? \\\
Peter notes the 2 metrics most significantly associated with longevity are strength and cardiorespiratory fitness (as measured by VO2 max)\\\
Risk factors for all-cause mortality include smoking (50% increase), type 2 diabetes (30% increase in mortality), high blood pressure (20% increase in mortality), coronary artery disease, end stage kidney disease, being in the bottom 25% of the population for VO2 max (having a low VO2 max)\\\
Being weak, relative to being strong, is about 250%\\\
Having a very low Vo2 max in the bottom 25% of the population versus being in the top 2.5% of the population is about 400%\\\
The 3rd thing that stands out is muscle mass \\\
But when you look at the data, you realize muscle mass is tightly associated with strength\\\
For listeners whose eyes are sort of glazing over as they talk about powerlifting, it’s worth pointing out that even if you never do a heavy squat, heavy bench press, or heavy deadlift, you have to be strong\\\
These associations show up over and over again in studies\\\
They use measures like grip strength, bench press, leg extension\\\
It becomes important for people to understand how to train for power \\\
Advice for training to get stronger \\\
Layne notes, “The principles are pretty much the same, it’s just the level to which they’re applied. And I think it’s important to point out that there are diminishing returns with strength.”\\\
He doesn’t think the studies are refined enough to pick this out at this point, because they’re not getting a population of powerlifters and looking at their longevity\\\
His guess is that at a certain point, you pretty much get all the benefits [for longevity], and just getting even stronger is probably not going to give you more\\\
Risk of injury is also something you want to avoid\\\
You see this with running, a J-shaped curve\\\
People can take it so far (be it powerlifting, running, or whatever) that being an extremist in their sport can make them more prone to early mortality\\\
As far as strength goes, the most important core principle is progressive overload \\\
When people hear this, many just think “weight on the bar”\\\
So if you are a beginner and start doing squats, you do 95 lbs for 5 reps\\\
Then next week you do 100 lbs for 5 reps\\\
The next week you do 105 lbs for 5 reps\\\
This is 1 form of progressive overload, and for most people coming to the gym, this is their experience\\\
But another effective form of progressive overload is increasing the reps (more on this below)\\\
But when you’re getting started, just putting more weight on the bar every week is a perfectly reasonable way to progress\\\
-Example of how progressive overload works for anyone\\\
People will say, “Well, I’m postmenopausal woman” or “I’m a 75 year old male. It’s too late for me.”\\\
No it’s not\\\
 Now is the best time \\\
When Layne was at the University of Illinois in the Department of Nutritional Sciences, he was right across the street from the Exercise Physiology Department, and they were conducting a study on frail elderly people (who almost couldn’t walk)\\\
They used progressive overload\\\
In the beginning, they were squatting to a really high chair\\\
Their progress was incredible\\\
In 12 weeks, they had people who could squat down to a below parallel chair and come back up (which is really something for a frail elderly person)\\\
“The difference in functionality and their lifestyle is going to be incredible, in terms of what they can do” \\\
So, one aspect of progressive overload is to add weight on the bar\\\
“But nobody’s able to increase weight on the bar forever”‒ Layne Norton  \\\
The longer you get into it, the more nonlinear it’s going to be\\\
The various ways to achieve progressive overload \\\
1 – Adding more weight (as mentioned above)\\\
2 – More repetitions \\\
3 – More hard sets (this is really something you only need to get to, as you get to be more advanced) \\\
Peter notes, “This is one thing that, from one of our earlier discussions, that really started to change my training. I started adding a little bit more sets at slightly lower RPE to net increase volume.”\\\
He was doing a lot more RPE 8-9, but only a few sets before he was really, really spent\\\
So he started doing a little more RPE 6-7 with more sets (more volume)\\\
He felt like this lowered his risk of injury\\\
And it was another way to progressively overload\\\
Layne agrees, “You’re always weighing those 2 things, your stimulus versus fatigue ratio”\\\
Layne is coached by a guy named Zach Robinson, who’s doing his PhD in Mike Zourdos’ lab at FAU\\\
He talks about stimulus versus fatigue a lot\\\
They do a lot of training in the RPE 5-6 area, which some people call easy\\\
When it comes to compound lift, Layne wouldn’t really call it easy, but he thinks about, “How can we maximize our stimulus and minimize fatigue?”\\\
If you’re talking about an RPE 9, how many sets at RPE 9 can you get?\\\
For Peter it’s 1-2 reps before he starts to compromise his form \\\
Layne knows from doing sets to failure of 10 reps, for a free barbell squat he might not be able to get 2-3 reps on his next set because it’s so fatiguing\\\
When we talk about RPEs (a measure for proximity to failure), this is important to point out\\\
How RPE works \\\
RPE has been adapted from running to lifting\\\
It’s on a scale of 1-10\\\
At RPE 10, you have no more reps left\\\
This was your absolute 100% effort\\\
At RPE 9, you could have done 1 more rep\\\
At RPE 8, you could have done 2 more reps, so on and so forth\\\
We know you don’t have to train to failure to grow muscle \\\
Training to failure may even be a bit counterproductive in terms of the fatigue it causes relative to the stimulus\\\
For most movements, you get the most hypertrophy and strength benefits going within a few reps of failure (a RPE of 7 or 8) \\\
If you can do more volume, it may be even more beneficial\\\
The downside is that people are really bad at estimating this, especially if you’ve never actually taken something to failure\\\
Beginners and intermediates tend to underestimate their RPE by about 5, which is pretty incredible\\\
When research makes them take the weight to failure (by yelling at them and encouraging them), on average they’ll get in 5 more reps than they had estimated\\\
The RPE validity in advanced lifters tends to be much more accurate\\\
Layne was at a powerlifting meet where they had a Tendo unit on the bar and were measuring bar velocity as they asked  them to rate their RPE after each attempt\\\
They found that RPE, as validated by velocity data, was a pretty good measure in that population of powerlifters, because they’ve taken so many sets near failure\\\
Layne’s summary: “You do need some experience going really hard and really close to failure. But once you have that experience and you understand what that feels like, then you can estimate better. You’re probably better off staying a few reps shy of failure and accumulating volume that way, just because going to failure is just so incredibly fatiguing.”\\\
Low-rep training, compound movements, and more tips for the average person [23:15]\\\
For a person who is not planning to go to a power meet, is there a need for them to go below four reps in training? \\\
Probably not, you can get plenty strong even doing sets of 10-15\\\
Now you will not be as strong (even per cross-sectional area) as somebody who trains for strength, because strength is a specific skill\\\
Layne’s best squat and summary on strength\\\
Layne’s best squat was 668 lbs\\\
6 months out from this, he was able to squat with added weight\\\
But he has not added much more lean body mass\\\
He was practicing the skill of a one rep max (which allowed him to do better on the one rep max)\\\
What % of his max was he training at?\\\
Mostly at 90% for singles, sometimes 95%\\\
His RPE was 8-9\\\
Considering multiples, would Layne do a 600 lb single, 3 times in a workout? \\\
Something like that\\\
This teaches you how to grind through a lift\\\
A lot of people have never had the experience of really sticking with a lift\\\
Interestingly, the more advanced somebody gets (in terms of strength), the slower their one rep max velocity will be\\\
Research studies show this all the time, somebody who’s kind of new will come in, they will absolutely smoke a weight, then you put 5 lbs on, and they get stapled\\\
Because they don’t have that grind capacity\\\
They don’t know how to do it\\\
Part of it may be psychological, but part of that’s probably physiological too\\\
They haven’t trained their body to recruit all the fibers that it can get\\\
Layne’s summary on strength:\\\
Lean body mass and strength are very closely tied together\\\
But when it gets to those finer levels of strength, it’s kind of just practicing the actual one rep max\\\
So when it comes to getting strong, you can absolutely get strong doing sets of 10, 15, because you’re increasing your lean body mass\\\
Do you need to do sets of 3, 4? No\\\
But don’t count them out because a lot of people actually just do really well with variety\\\
Periodization (the planned manipulation of training variables (load, sets, and repetitions) in order to maximize training adaptations and to prevent the onset of overtraining syndrome) was kind of a big thing for lifting, back in the day, and now research studies show, it doesn’t appear to produce greater gains in lean body mass\\\
It may provide a little bit better strength gains, but that’s probably just because people peak better when you’re periodizing things\\\
People tend to like periodization better because they’re varying their repetition and are not as bored\\\
“So you never want to poo poo the psychological effects of those things… Adherence is the most important thing.”‒ Layne Norton \\\
Adherence to training\\\
Layne always asks people, “Well, what do you enjoy? What’s going to get you to show up consistently?”\\\
There are many ways to skin a cat, slightly less technical lifts that are still going to produce really great gains, in terms of strength and lean body mass\\\
How important are compound movements?\\\
Do you think there is still an essential need for some sort of compound movement, like a hip thruster, at least as a complement, or a leg press? \\\
Peter is asking for the person who isn’t confident they have the technical ability to execute a squat or deadlift\\\
You could mess up something like a hip thruster and hurt yourself, but it’s a lot harder with this exercise\\\
Layne went through a phase where he thought everything learned from the magazines (the “bro science”) was junk, but now studies are coming out that validate some of this “bro science” from 20, 30 years ago\\\
There does appear to be different areas of the leg muscles (the quadriceps for example) that are better activated by, say, a leg extension, as compared to a leg press, compared to a squat\\\
Layne thinks it’s good to have variety \\\
He thinks it’s good to have compound lifts as well\\\
There’s some interesting data that suggests that you don’t have to get as close to failure on compound lifts to still get the same stimulation, compared to isolation exercises (where you do seem to have to get much closer to failure to get those benefits)\\\
See studies listed in the selected links section at the end\\\
How strength training supports longevity and quality of life: bone density, balance, and more [28:15]\\\
If you’re looking at longevity or the quality of life the question is, “What is most analogous to what these people are going to be doing and where they’re going to be needing it?”\\\
If it’s bending over and picking something up, that’s some kind of hinge\\\
If it’s sitting down and standing back up, that’s some kind of squat\\\
You can use variations\\\
For a beginner \\\
Start with no weight and just teach them how to hinge\\\
How to use their hips\\\
How to use their knees\\\
How to track their legs with their feet\\\
How to balance and this sort of thing\\\
Once they’re established with that, have them move on to holding a kettlebell in front of them\\\
Then you can progress with the weight of that\\\
Then progress to something like a safety bar (where they’re not having to worry so much about hands and whatnot)\\\
Next to a box\\\
Eventually take the box away and maybe they can progress to a barbell squat\\\
Layne’s summary: The puritan in me would be like, “Yes, everybody should barbell squat,” but I know that that’s not true. I think the biggest thing is just getting something close and analogous to the things that are going to be important in your day to day life as you get older. \\\
Risk of falls for seniors \\\
When you think about elderly people who fall, the stats are insane, something like half the people over age 65 who go to the hospital for a fall never come out\\\
Peter has seen many studies on this, 30-40% of people over the age of 65 who break their hip will be dead within a year \\\
This is due to infection, immobilization, or they get pneumonia (or something like that)\\\
The benefits of lifting heavy weights for bone density \\\
There was an Australian study of older women who had osteopenia (if not osteoporosis) who were put on a simple lifting program\\\
Peter saw the PI on YouTube discussing their results\\\
He remembers one lady deadlift her body weight\\\
These are women who had never lifted a weight before\\\
And their symptoms got so much better\\\
Layne agrees the best thing you can do for bone density is lift weight\\\
Other benefits of strength and balance  \\\
He also points out that people get very focused on bone density, but what if they didn’t fall in the first place?\\\
What if they had the strength (&/or balance) to catch themselves?\\\
With resistance training, even if you did fall, you’re going to have more muscle mass and you’re probably going to have more bone density‒ these are going to help\\\
You can have all sorts of other interventions to improve lean body mass, but they all work way better with resistance training because you’re creating a need for the tissue\\\
An teleological perspective on building muscle mass \\\
Layne thinks this is something that has been missed in the teleological perspective of this‒ “You have to give your body a reason to lay down tissue”\\\
Muscle is energetically expensive\\\
The body is not going to go, “Oh yeah, we got some extra calories. Let’s just lay down some lean tissue.”\\\
This doesn’t make sense from the body’s perspective\\\
The body wants to keep you alive long enough to reproduce, and once you’ve done that, it’s just trying to prevent you from starving\\\
Over the course of human history, the risk of dying from starvation is magnitudes greater than from diseases from too much nutrition\\\
If you eat more protein you can lay done more lean mass, but it’s going to be minimal compared to what you can build through resistance training \\\
“When you couple resistance training with high enough protein (or any of these other modalities), now you’re creating the turnover in the tissue, that the body has the requirement to lay down that tissue”‒ Layne Norton\\\
Peak capacity for strength as a person ages and variations in men and women [33:00]\\\
Is Layne stronger today than he was at 20? \\\
Yeah\\\
Is he stronger than he was at 35? \\\
Layne has come off his peak a little bit\\\
He doesn’t think it’s a sarcopenia thing but an accumulation of injuries and not being able to train the way he used to train\\\
Peter summarizes Layne answer: Layne’s lower strength compared to age 35 is not necessarily because he’s losing type II fibers with age, it’s more about his capacity to train due to pain\\\
Figure 1. Characteristics of different muscle fiber types. \\\
Does Layne believe he could be as strong now as at age 30 (on a muscle biopsy basis)? \\\
He thinks he probably could \\\
In the literature, you do see differences between young and old, but most of those get ameliorated when you start adding in resistance training\\\
MEN vs WOMEN:\\\
Women can gain lean mass and strength just as much as men \\\
Women have been shown to gain just as much lean mass as a percentage of their starting lean mass\\\
The increase is relative\\\
For example, if one added 10% lean mass\\\
If you’re a male with 70 kg of lean mass, now you have 77 kg (154 lbs → 170 lbs)\\\
If your a female with 50 kg of lean mass, now you have 55 kg (110 lbs → 121 lbs)\\\
The literature shows women can add the same % of lean mass as men, and the same thing for strength\\\
Differences in men and women \\\
There is some evidence that women may be able to tolerate higher training volumes than men\\\
Most of these studies only looked at young adults (20s-30s)\\\
Layne wonders if this is more of a function of having a smaller body and handling less weight\\\
Peter relates, “My wife would tell you that no one can handle a cold less than me, and I think it’s true. I have an insanely high pain tolerance except for when my sinuses are congested and I have a miserable cough, then I turn into a little baby. So there might be something about women just being tougher too.” \\\
Layne has thought about this quite a bit\\\
Take super heavyweight powerlifters an an extreme example\\\
Ray Williams is one of the greatest drug tested powerlifters in history\\\
He’s the first man to raw squat over 1,000 pounds\\\
He was a college football player\\\
On a DEXA, he had 308 pounds of lean mass (and he’s probably over 400 pounds of total body weight)\\\
Let’s say we’re talking about working with 80% of a one-rep max\\\
His 80% is 800 lbs\\\
A female’s, if she’s doing a one-rep max of 300 lbs, 80% is 240 lbs\\\
The % is the same but Layne is not sure you can say the same thing happens with the body because at the end of the day connective tissue is connective tissue \\\
Layne knows very, very few super heavyweight powerlifters who train the main lifts 3-4 times a week\\\
Some of the lighter weight classes do\\\
Layne thinks there’s something about the absolute load \\\
Part of him thinks the idea that women can recover a little bit better might be that they’re just using absolute lower loads\\\
But we’d have to have some more intricate data\\\
Effects of testosterone (endogenous and exogenous) on muscle gain in the short- and long-term [36:45]\\\
Peter adds that men and women have a full log difference in testosterone\\\
He has heard people suggest that testosterone is not important in muscle gain\\\
But, you only need to look at tested versus untested powerlifters and bodybuilders to know testosterone’s doing something\\\
How does Layne reconcile this?\\\
Layne thinks one of the main benefits of testosterone is the increase in satellite cell number, which is going to increase your potential for increasing muscle mass\\\
This is a theory called the mononuclear dominant theory, but he doesn’t want to talk about it like it’s set in stone proven\\\
Satellite cells are quiescent cells that sit on the outside of a muscle fiber\\\
And through various ways (resistance, training, testosterone, whatever), you can get those satellite cells to be donated to the muscle fiber\\\
Muscle fiber is the only cell type that is multinucleated \\\
And we think the reason is each myonuclei can only control protein synthesis for a certain area\\\
The muscle fiber can only grow as big as it has myonuclei \\\
So the more myonuclei you can donate, the greater your potential is\\\
One reason we think that men have more lean mass than women is during puberty hormonal difference emerge, and exposure to testosterone increase the number of myonuclei\\\
This gives men a greater overall potential for lean mass\\\
Up until puberty, males and females tend to have similar amounts of lean mass\\\
So now when you talk about taking exogenous levels of testosterone, now you’re donating even more myonuclei, and so, you can reach a higher ceiling\\\
Layne thinks this is the strongest argument against the crossover of transgender sports for people who were previously male but now identify as female, you can’t get rid of the long term benefit conveyed by the fusion of those myonuclei\\\
He acknowledges this statement might get him in trouble\\\
Compare it muscle memory‒ if you have trained before but stop training, you can gain back muscle much faster than it takes to build it\\\
This is true even for people who have stopped training for years\\\
They gain it back faster than it originally took to build it\\\
Animal study found muscle growth boosted by previous exposure to testosterone \\\
There was a mouse study where they gave the animals testosterone and resistance trained them \\\
One group received testosterone and the other did not\\\
Both groups gained strength and lean mass, but the group getting testosterone gained more \\\
Then they had a washout period, for a long as it took both groups to get back to their original lean mass number\\\
They had both groups train again, without drugs in either group\\\
The group that originally had testosterone gained muscle significantly faster than the other group\\\
Our best understanding is it’s probably these myonuclei that got fused through that extra testosterone that confers that long-term benefit, and that’s how we think about max potential \\\
Do we think that occurs only during a critical window of development, or does that happen if you’re 40 years old and you’re taking exogenous testosterone? \\\
We don’t really know because there’s no data on this\\\
Layne speculates that if you have a certain level of testosterone through puberty and now you’re an adult and you maintain that as your natural state (you don’t get too obese or too underweight)\\\
You’ve probably fused the amount of myonuclei that you’re going to fuse (at least from testosterone)\\\
Now if you start taking testosterone exogenously, you’ve ramped that up another notch\\\
And now you can fuse more myonuclei\\\
Anecdotally, this would make sense because drug use in bodybuilding has continued to go up, up, up\\\
We’re getting to the point where guys aren’t getting much bigger\\\
Last year, there was about half a dozen professional bodybuilders who died \\\
It’s getting to the point where they can’t go any higher with drugs and you’re seeing lean mass start to cap out\\\
To compete in natural bodybuilding you have to test drug-free and take a polygraph that says you haven’t used drugs in 5 years\\\
Peter thinks this timeframe is interesting\\\
In theory they care because you may still confer a benefit 5 years later, even if you’ve been drug free\\\
A polygraph is not always accurate\\\
As an aside, in powerlifting they don’t use a polygraph\\\
The way the water drug testing works is, once you enter the water drug testing pool (so you’ve qualified for some international competition), you could be drug tested at any time\\\
You have to use a whereabouts form to provide your whereabouts\\\
And if they select you to be drug tested and you don’t do it, you can get a strike against you and be out of competition for a certain period of time\\\
Layne thinks there are cheaters but it’s not rampant\\\
There’s simply not that much money in it\\\
The most that has ever been on the line for him in competition is $3000\\\
How Layne is prepping for his upcoming IPF World Masters Powerlifting competition [44:00]\\\
*After this recording, Layne finished in 1st place at the 2022 IPF World Masters Powerlifting Championships\\\
***\\\
Layne is training for worlds, this is his first major international meet in about 7 years\\\
He mentioned yesterday that his back hurt and he really backed off\\\
He also has some knee and hip pain\\\
How do you think about injuries?  How much longer do you want to be loading yourself to the level of basically putting cars on your back and lifting cars off the ground? \\\
Candidly, Layne thinks if he wins Masters Worlds Powerlifting Competition, he’d probably give a hard thought to being done competing \\\
Part of his problem is that he loves to train so much\\\
He never really gave himself time to get pain free\\\
As soon as he started feeling better, he would start pushing again\\\
He has slowly gotten more intelligent because he used to think he was Superman\\\
For example yesterday when he was warming up on squats he was saying, “All right, it’s not happening today. There’s no reason to try and force this” \\\
Previously, his narrative would have been to power through it because that’s what it takes\\\
“I think one of the most important things is knowing when to press the gas pedal and knowing when to back off a little bit. Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.”‒ Layne Norton  \\\
Layne is probably a little bit weird in that he would train for 3-4 hours a day because he just loves to train \\\
He loves the way it makes him feel\\\
He loves feeling strong\\\
The egocentric part of him probably loves to feel like a badass loading up 500-600 lbs in the gym \\\
But he’s gotten to the point now where he’s like, “All right, if it’s there today, we take it. If it’s not there, we take what’s there and then we live to fight another day” because he’s had so many experiences where he’s tried to press on this\\\
The way pain works, the more pain you have, the more pain you’re going to have because you just end up getting fixated and ruminating on it\\\
Research shows that the more you ruminate on the pain, the more you think about it, and the more times you trigger it, the worse it’s going to get\\\
It’s this delicate balance between, I kind of know how far I can press something before I’m making it worse\\\
The research also shows that you don’t want to completely just stop lifting because you detrain \\\
And then when you come back (even if you’re pain-free), you’re more likely to retrigger it because you’ve lost that adaptation\\\
So when you have those pain triggers, you want to find, either a weight amount or a movement pattern or something similar to what you’re trying to do, but at low enough pain that you can start to build back \\\
For example, yesterday he would have done some squats and deadlifts but couldn’t\\\
So today he did some leg press\\\
He’s still going to get some stimulation for his quads (the primary movers of the squat)\\\
He did  a single-leg dumbbell RDL\\\
He was able to do those with no pain\\\
It’s not loading as much as he would like, but he’s still using his hamstrings and lower back, and he’s still gettin in some of that movement pattern\\\
He’s getting a training effect and some adaptation without further triggering that pain\\\
Layne’s workout today \\\
He did some stuff he missed throughout the week\\\
Dumbbell pressing\\\
More single-leg RDLs\\\
Mobility work\\\
Not a lot of intensive stuff\\\
Ideally he would do squat, bench press, and deadlift because it’s completely specific to what he’s going to express on competition day, but those are very fatiguing movements\\\
Anxiety is part of it too\\\
When you know how much you can do and how much you’ve done, you have anxiety about those movements because it’s like you’re being tested and compared to what you’ve previously done\\\
Sometimes just creating a little bit of a variation of that movement where you can just let the weight happen and pick your RPE, and if it’s not a previous set weight, it doesn’t bother you\\\
He’s started using a lot more variations to build that baseline level of strength\\\
And then when it comes to the actual competition lifts, he’s mostly just focusing on doing heavy singles and building his volume through other areas\\\
How many times a week will you do those heavy single workouts? \\\
Once or twice, depending on how he feels\\\
Peter’s experiment to take the psychology out of training \\\
Take a powerlifter and their entire training cycle (6 months building up to a competition) and have them lift without knowing the weight on the bar\\\
Their coach would tell them how many reps to do for every set or to what RPE to go until\\\
It would be completely programmed, but take away the psychology and don’t let the athletes suffer from knowing, “Oh, my god, I should be able to do this many reps”\\\
One day they might get down on a bar and the bar is going to be really light and they will be told, “I think you’re going to get 10 reps here. Let’s see it.”\\\
And they have  no idea what % of their max it is\\\
Layne knows a guy who completed his entire training cycle that way, Bryce Lewis\\\
One of the top lifters in the world\\\
Layne competed against him multiple times\\\
Bryce would have his girlfriend put trash bags over the weights \\\
She was also a competitive powerlifter\\\
But Layne wants to know how much he’s lifting\\\
He also has trust in his coach to know they’re not going to put something on the bar they don’t think he can do\\\
Layne told Peter once that the difference between powerlifting and bodybuilding is in powerlifting, all of your pain is compressed into the gym\\\
In bodybuilding, most of your pain is actually out of the gym\\\
Is there anything you do with your nutrition as you get closer to the meet? \\\
Not really\\\
Layne is sitting very close to the weight class he’s going to compete in so he doesn’t have to make a bunch of changes (he’s 208 lbs)\\\
If he was at 215-217 lbs, then it gets to the point where a weight of 205 becomes a little bit untenable\\\
When he competes, it’s a 2 hour weigh-in (2 hours between weigh-in and lifting)\\\
So if you cut 10-15 lbs, you’re not going to be able to rehydrate and refuel quickly enough\\\
There are organizations where you can weigh-in a day before, and one organization had 48 hour weigh-in\\\
In a way, this makes it more dangerous because people will really cut\\\
For example, Dan Green (a well-known, untested powerlifter) weighed-in at 220 and the next day was walking around at 255 or something\\\
It’s just incredible the amounts of weight these guys are cutting\\\
You see them with IVs and all that kind of stuff\\\
For Layne, he can cut 2-3, maybe 4% of his body weight, but he doesn’t want to go much more than that because with 2 hours, you just don’t have time\\\
Are you taking 5 g of creatine daily? \\\
Layne keeps taking creatine because he can modify sodium and fiber to get some water weight out on those last few days\\\
He tries to be a little bit underweight the day before the meet so he can eat enough calories the day before and not feel like he has to shovel food down\\\
He will go pretty aggressive on Thursday and Friday for a Saturday meet\\\
On Saturday after weigh-in, he has 2 hours to get food down, but there’s also a lot of other stuff he has to do (like warm-up)\\\
He wants his brain to be free to think about the stuff he’s got to do and not thinking about nutrition or electrolytes\\\
For the most part, he’s never really had issues with cramping\\\
He’s never had issued with energy on the meet day\\\
He thinks a lot of that is simply keeping himself pretty close to within striking distance\\\
Your leverages can change based on your weight thickness\\\
The tightness of your belt can change\\\
All that stuff can make a difference in terms of the style of squat you do or how you feel\\\
Layne adds, “Just being able to train in a manner that’s going to be very similar to how I compete, I feel like is a little bit of an advantage for me, compared to people who have to cut quite a bit of weight”\\\
If you had to guess, what would your body fat be at weigh-in? \\\
He calipers at around 8%, so by DXA it is probably 11-12%\\\
In his experience DXA is 3-4% higher than calipers\\\
Creatine supplementation [54:30]\\\
Creatine is one of the supplements Peter gets the most questions about\\\
It’s also one of the supplements that he feels most confident telling patients this is a supplement worth taking\\\
It’s safe\\\
It probably has efficacy\\\
Is Layne okay with a little bit of weight gain because he’s going to pull in more water?  Why is creatine so important? \\\
Creatine is great for bodybuilding\\\
Creatine is a high energy phosphate donor\\\
In muscle, it exists as phosphocreatine\\\
And when you take supplemental creatine, it’ll come into the muscle, and it’ll get a phosphate attached to it (creating phosphocreatine)\\\
Originally, the only mechanism for enhancing performance that we thought of, was it’s role as a high energy phosphate donor\\\
Benefits of creatine‒ people would perform better, people increase their lean body mass and strength, there’s even some cognitive benefits \\\
Layne likes to tell people, “I don’t even know why we’re having this conversation anymore”\\\
It’s incredibly inexpensive for what you’re getting\\\
When he sees people talk about some of these other supplements and they’re not even taking creatine monohydrate, he thinks, “You’re stepping over dollars to pick up pennies because this is just the lowest hanging fruit”\\\
Even at your size and your demand, is there any benefit to taking more than 5 g a day? \\\
Some people have postulated there might be\\\
Layne hasn’t seen really clear evidence for it yet\\\
You could argue that there’s really no downside to taking the extra\\\
However, for some people, creatine can be a GI irritant \\\
Action of creatine \\\
We know creatine can act as a high energy phosphate donor\\\
The energy currency of your cells is ATP\\\
So when you are exercising or just doing anything, in order to drive muscular contraction, your ATP donates a phosphate\\\
The liberation of that phosphate to form ADP and a free phosphate is energetically favorable and it helps drive these muscular contractions\\\
Creatine (or phosphocreatine) can act as a high energy phosphate donor to regenerate ATP and allow you to perform better\\\
Creatine is also a really powerful osmolite\\\
It pulls water into muscle tissue, which in and of itself may actually be anabolic\\\
But regardless of the mechanism, we do know that when you take creatine, you see improvements in lean mass\\\
Some people will say, “Well, that’s just water”\\\
But muscle is 70% water\\\
There’s research to show that even non-contractile mass (just water) may improve strength and contractibility\\\
We’re not sure exactly how\\\
But it could just be a that the volumization of the cell is a benefit\\\
Peter thinks conceptually a more hydrated cell may be better able to carry out its function\\\
So if the function of a myofibril is contractile, release, contract, release, and it has more water, it seems logical that it’s going to be better at clearing metabolic waste and recruiting fuel, which would at least be 2 things that would factor into its ability to do that\\\
If you look at anything that improves hypertrophy, a big portion of it is water \\\
It’s not just all myofibril\\\
Layne thinks regardless of the mechanisms, it’s pretty clear that creatine works and it’s safe \\\
They’ve done numerous randomized control trials, some of them being well over a year long\\\
Concerns about creatine \\\
You get an increase in creatinine, which can be a marker of renal function\\\
Peter recalls a recent article in JAMA which said we should look at cystatin C instead of creatinine to assess renal function\\\
This is a PSA for other docs out there listening and other patients to say, “Please look at my cystatin C as a way to estimate kidney function”\\\
Every time you order labs on somebody and you see their creatinine, it’ll tell you what their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is\\\
Peter just ignores this and only looks at cystatin C\\\
Layne adds that some other things can get a bit wonky from lifting weights, like liver enzymes\\\
He tells people these are markers\\\
If you have liver failure or kidney failure, it’s very, very likely you will have elevated liver enzymes and elevated creatinine\\\
But just because you have elevated liver enzymes or elevated creatinine, does not mean that you necessarily have damage to those tissues\\\
You have to disconnect those two\\\
Layne feels that correlation versus causation is something that’s not taught very well in school because he sees some physicians get hung up on values that are not in the normal range\\\
Instead, just look at the person sitting in front of you who obviously works out, who is in good shape\\\
If you’re concerned about your kidneys, then do a 24-hour urine collection or an ultrasound or whatever you have to do to verify that they’re safe, but Layne doesn’t worry about that kind of stuff\\\
Some people claim creatine can cause hair loss, but Layne doesn’t think the data on that is very compelling\\\
There was a single study in 2009 that showed an increase in DHT from supplementing with creatine\\\
They reported that levels of DHT increased by 56% after 7 days of creatine loading and remained increased 40% above baseline after 14 days maintenance\\\
He’s never seen it replicated or followed-up\\\
Layne adds, the interesting thing we know is that creatine doesn’t affect androgen levels\\\
So where is this increase in DHT coming from? \\\
No randomized control trials has shown that creatine actually causes changes to hair follicles or causes hair loss\\\
Maybe it does, but he would think that if that data existed, we would’ve seen it already\\\
Are there significant benefits from creatine supplementation on non-lifting days? \\\
Such as a hard cardio day\\\
We’re not talking about sprints where there would be a clear benefit for that type of high intensity effort\\\
Layne would guess yes \\\
A recent meta-analysis evaluated different ways of taking creatine and showed if you take 5 g a day, you get increases in lean mass, strength, and performance\\\
If you take more than 5 g per day, you also get increases\\\
But it’s hard to compare them directly because of the way they did the meta-analysis\\\
They looked at taking it on lifting days‒ they saw benefits\\\
They looked at taking it on non-lifting days‒ they also saw benefits\\\
Layne thinks you can probably get away with just taking it on lifting days, but keep in mind the benefits of creatine come from accumulation\\\
So it’s key to saturate the muscle cell \\\
When Peter was a kid reading Bro Science magazines, he remembers taking 30 g a day for a week or something crazy, then taking 5 g thereafter\\\
You would do that for a couple months\\\
Then come off it for a month\\\
Then repeat the cycle\\\
Layne agrees, that was definitely a thing\\\
Research does show if you load it, you will saturate the muscle cell faster\\\
Layne tells people, “There’s no solutions, there’s only trade-offs”\\\
The trade-off with creatine loading is that a lot of people will get bad GI irritation (bloating, nausea, etc.)\\\
If you’re playing the long game, it doesn’t matter\\\
You’re talking about getting the results you want in one week as opposed to three weeks\\\
If you take 5 g a day, within a few weeks you’ll be saturated and you’ll be getting the same benefits \\\
People will ask about taking it just on lifting days\\\
But it’s pretty cheap\\\
It’s easier to forget something when you only do it on certain days; sometimes it’s easier to make it part of the routine\\\
People ask about the timing of when to take creatine\\\
There is very small bit of evidence that it might work better taking it after a workout\\\
But Layne tells people to just take it whenever you would regularly take it\\\
For him, he takes it first thing in the morning\\\
As far as cycling on and off creatine\\\
There is evidence that you reduce your endogenous production of creatine when you’re on it, and that the creatine receptor on the muscle cell down-regulates a little bit\\\
The important thing to keep in mind is this doesn’t mean that your intracellular levels of creatine are falling\\\
Layne doesn’t think there is a reason to come off because they’ve shown that if you do come off, everything goes back to normal and you lose the benefit of the supplemental creatine within a month or so\\\
He thinks as long as intramuscular levels of creatine are not falling, there’s no benefit to coming off\\\
People used to equate supplements with steroids, and you’re supposed to cycle steroids\\\
This is why they think we should cycle supplements\\\
But creatine is not hormonal, and it doesn’t have the same biofeedback loop so there’s no reason to cycle it\\\
How important is rep speed and time under tension? [1:05:30]\\\
One of Newton’s laws is force = mass x acceleration\\\
If you’re going to press your dumbbells, one school of thought is to press them as quickly as possible\\\
Because the mass is fixed, so any speed of lifting is acceleration because you’re moving against gravity\\\
But the faster you can do it, the greater the force\\\
At some point, the weight becomes so heavy that you increase the effort more on the mass variable than on the acceleration variable\\\
So you can manipulate mass and acceleration to reach maximal force\\\
An extreme example is a one-rep max\\\
But as Layne pointed out earlier, the more elite a powerlifter becomes, the slower it is\\\
So the emphasis is on mass, which is what you get scored on\\\
How do we think about the mixing and matching of the mass versus the acceleration in an effort to optimize force? (on the concentric) \\\
Of course, we also don’t want to go to maximum force every time because using a light weight you could move too quickly and injure yourself\\\
Layne points out that strength is basically force\\\
Using the same force, you will move a heavy weight slower than a light weight\\\
Layne’s coach Zach advises doing a heavy single or double followed by back-off sets are relatively light (RPE 4-5) but moving as quickly as possible\\\
Peter’s takeaway: On the heavy weights, you’re going to move slow because they have to, but to keep training strength, you want to move as quickly as possible as the weight decreases \\\
Does this happen with Layne? \\\
It’s hard to tell because he’s never actually done the calculation of force\\\
He imagines there’s a sweet spot where too heavy probably has less force, but he’s not sure where that is\\\
For hypertrophy, he thinks force is probably less important \\\
It’s more about having enough sufficiently hard sets, however you slice that\\\
The idea of time under tension training was very popular\\\
In the initial research, one study had people doing curls, something around 6 second eccentric, 6 second concentric, to failure\\\
Another group did the normal cadence and match the number of reps in the first group\\\
They found the group doing slow eccentrics and concentrics gained more muscle\\\
The problem is, they were using 30% of their one-rep max for 10 reps going really slow\\\
If you were going at a normal pace, how many times could you do 30% of a one-rep max (30, 40, 50)?\\\
Layne’s not saying the study was bad, it simply answered the question it wanted to answer\\\
If you are going to compare them straight up, you need both groups to work to failure to achieve the same level of intensity\\\
 When they do that, they see very little difference between slow lifting and fast lifting \\\
A couple studies recently came out looking at fast eccentrics versus slow eccentrics and found there was a little bit better outcome with fast eccentrics with respect to muscle mass\\\
See the selected links section at the end\\\
Peter notes, “The only time I’ve ever done a fast eccentric is on my Exerfly machine because you’re forced to. It’s pulling you down so quickly that you’re screaming down and you’re coming to a stop. Outside of that it never occurred to me to do an eccentric quickly.”\\\
If he’s doing eccentric deadlifts, he’s trying to come down as slowly as possible, thinking that it is more time under tension\\\
Layne thinks the time is part of the lift as well\\\
You don’t want to take it too extreme and dive bomb a squat when there’s no tension on the bar\\\
Consider a bicep curl \\\
Have 2 people curl the same weight, using the same speed on their concentric\\\
1st person does a 2 sec concentric and 2 sec eccentric\\\
2nd person does a 2 sec concentric and a 6 sec eccentric\\\
Will the 1st person produce more hypertrophy? \\\
Layne thinks it might be better\\\
If you think about mechanical transduction and the force (the mechanical tension being applied to a muscle) when you’re getting to that point where the muscle is stopping and then having to come the other way, if it’s fast, that’s probably more tension at that specific point\\\
So we just don’t know enough about this stuff right now to really be able to say for sure\\\
But there is benefit from slow movements for people who have pain or don’t want to use a heavy weight\\\
A lot of time pain can be tied to velocity, and if you slow down a movement, it won’t be as painful\\\
Layne has used tempo training pretty liberally in some of his training cycles to make it so he had to use less weight but still keep it difficult\\\
Now is this as good as his regular movement?  \\\
Maybe not, but it’s better than doing nothing\\\
“Don’t let perfection be the enemy of progress.  I do think that slow movements still have application for people.”‒ Layne Norton\\\
At the end of the day, the biggest determinant of hypertrophy is just doing enough number of hard sets, however that looks \\\
Validity of super slow rep protocols, and the overall importance of doing any exercise [1:12:45]\\\
A 30-minute, once-a-week workout  \\\
Peter has had a couple patients whose disdain for exercise is so great that the most he can negotiate them doing is one 20-30 minute workout per week doing the super slow protocol\\\
At a specific gym with specific types of equipment, they do 8-10 different machines and they only do 1 set and it’s to failure\\\
The sets are typically titrated to be somewhere between 90 and 105 seconds\\\
If you’re going more than that, the weight is too light\\\
If you’re less than that, the weight is too heavy\\\
They might do 4 simple upper body exercises and 4 lower\\\
So there might be a press, a pull, a bicep, a tricep, a leg press\\\
The reason he negotiates is because otherwise they will do nothing, and he can’t think of any better benefit in 30” once a week than this\\\
The challenge is, it’s’ really hard to go to failure\\\
And it’s hard to do it 8 consecutive times, which is what you asking a person to do in 30 minutes\\\
What is your take on the super slow protocols? \\\
Famous bodybuilders like Mike Mentzer have taken these protocols to the limits \\\
Layne thinks, when it comes to hypertrophy, you have a lot of options \\\
A friend of Layne’s (Jeremy Loenneke) posted a paper on social media looking at isometric contraction, and they were able to show some hypertrophy with a long isometric contraction\\\
Before we used to think that isometric doesn’t grow muscle\\\
Jeremy was on the podcast in 2021\\\
Layne’s claim to fame is he introduced him to BFR (blood flow restriction) training \\\
Super slow is one tool in the toolkit to get some of the benefits from resistance training\\\
The point is to get to the gym consistently \\\
Are super slow protocols as good as compound movements with a free bar and training at a normal pace?\\\
Probably not, but it’s better than sitting at home and doing nothing\\\
Super slow and the physiology of hypertrophy \\\
When it comes to the super slope, we still don’t fully understand how the process of muscle hypertrophy occurs\\\
For hypertrophy we know that you need to progressively overload\\\
But we still have a lot of gaps in our understanding\\\
One of the things we think matters is metabolic stress, this idea that you’re accumulating metabolic byproducts inside the muscle as you work it out\\\
Hence BFR (blood flow restriction)\\\
There is some decent mechanistic data to support this in terms of hydrogen ion accumulation, how that may affect signaling and even calcium release into the sarcoplasm\\\
Layne thinks when you’re dealing with that super slow protocol, you’re kind of pushing a little bit more on that metabolic stress as opposed to the mechanical tension portion of it\\\
But there still is mechanical tension\\\
A lot of people think about mechanical tension just literally as weight on the bar\\\
What people don’t realize is mechanical tension is cumulative, because otherwise why wouldn’t we just load up a heavy single and just do that every time? \\\
That’s the most amount of mechanical tension you can get in terms of a set point in time\\\
So it seems pretty obvious that mechanical tension has to be a little bit cumulative throughout a set\\\
If you’re doing super slow, you might have a light weight, but you also have a really long time that you’re under that light weight accumulating metabolic stress and mechanical tensions\\\
So it makes sense that you would have some of those benefits\\\
Downsides to super slow \\\
Layne thinks the bigger downside is you’re probably not going to get as strong doing that methodology as you are doing a little bit more normal pace\\\
And it may have a little bit less functionality than somebody who’s done kind of more traditional strength training\\\
Peter’s bigger issue with super slow‒  “I don’t think people really can go to failure”\\\
It’s really difficult\\\
It’s easier to do an exercise when you don’t have to go to failure, but you make up for in with volume\\\
The other point is the reason why we exercise\\\
To live well\\\
Peter notes, “I do worry that when we rob people of movements that require more than one plane, movements that require balance and some coordination, we’re not giving them the full benefit of the exercise, of the reason to exercise”\\\
Any exercise is better than no exercise [1:18:15]\\\
Layne thinks when a lot of people get into things, they have “paralysis by analysis”\\\
At a certain point, this is an excuse to do nothing\\\
Just go do something\\\
When it comes to people who have been sedentary, Layne asks what they like doing\\\
If the only outcome you’re going for is perfection, few people are going to be able to hit that\\\
A lot of the conversation boils down to this isn’t as good as this, but it’s still better than that\\\
Do we really need optimal to see a benefit?\\\
“Do people really need optimal to get out of the state we’re in where so many people have type 2 diabetes and have obesity and are dying from heart disease and cancer?  Honestly, if we can get 50% of the way there, we’ll probably see a huge benefit”‒ Layne Norton\\\
Peter adds, when you divide people into quartiles of fitness and strength, the improvement in benefit always comes from moving from the bottom quartile to the next one \\\
You’re going to achieve the most benefit when you go from being in the lowest 20% of the population to the second 20th percentile population\\\
Layne agrees, “One of the biggest failures of the fitness industry, quite honestly, is convincing people that they need to have a shredded six pack and be really muscular to be fit. No, you don’t have to.”\\\
He thinks most people who are lean probably don’t feel that fit\\\
When he was very lean for body building, he had no energy, no sex drive, thought about food all the time, and was miserable\\\
The real sweet spot is probably where you got a little bit of fluff, you’re still relatively lean\\\
Data on steps per day \\\
The step data is pretty clear, there’s a huge inflection at about 8,000 steps per day\\\
You still get benefits by going up to 20,000 steps a day\\\
But the vast majority of benefits (the drop in mortality) is from going from 2,000 to 8,000 steps\\\
Layne doesn’t think there is anything magic about steps, it’s just looking at people getting more active\\\
One of the biggest failures of the fitness industry is the messaging that you need to look a certain way to be healthy\\\
The messaging should be, it’s a very low barrier to be healthy\\\
Even if you just get out and walk for 30 minutes a day, there is so much benefit from that compared to just sitting\\\
Layne advises, “Just doing anything in the gym” \\\
People say machines are worthless, but they are great tools for applying tension to muscle\\\
A free barbell movement might be more functional, but if it’s the difference betweening training and not, then use the machines\\\
Peter doesn’t think most people listening to this (himself included) ever want to be 4-5% body fat\\\
Layne agrees, “You don’t, trust me”\\\
But someone who is 25% body fat would like to be 20% body fat\\\
Navigating social media: advice for judging the quality of information from “experts” online [1:23:00]\\\
How can a person make sense of the never ending sea of experts out there? \\\
A couple years ago Layne had Alan Levinovitz on his podcast\\\
He’s a religious studies expert, he wrote a book on the fallacy of naturalism\\\
They talked about how hard it is for people to identify experts\\\
He said something really insightful, “What you should look for in an expert is the exact opposite of what you probably think you should look for. If somebody sounds really confident, they’re probably not an expert. What you really want to look for is people who sound kind of doubtful and they say things like, “Probably, maybe, possibly.””\\\
And when you speak to true experts, if you ask them a question, the first thing they’ll do is ask you a question back (unless the questions is very contextual)\\\
An expert needs to know the context to be able to answer correctly\\\
For example, if someone asks Layne about his thoughts on X, he’ll reply, “Okay, well as it pertains to what? Hypertrophy or strength or fitness?”\\\
 Credentials help\\\
If Layne sees somebody with a PhD in a certain subject, he’s probably going to give them a lot more leeway if they say something he disagrees with\\\
He will dig a little deeper to see what they said that\\\
But he’s seen some PhDs say some really dumb stuff (even from Harvard)\\\
Credentials are a nice thing, but they’re not foolproof\\\
Peter adds that with Layne’s knowledge background, it’s a lot easier for him to look at someone’s Instagram account and quickly realize this person knows nothing\\\
What are some criteria the average person (who doesn’t have the knowledge base) can use to disentangle this world? \\\
Layne doesn’t think magic words exist\\\
Part of his PhD program was a qualifying exam \\\
This was a 4 hour oral examination in front of 4 professors\\\
When he was prepping for this Dr. Layman (his advisor, who has also been on the podcast) said, “They’re going to push you in whatever subject they start out on until you don’t know, and you need to be able to say, “I don’t know””\\\
They did exactly that\\\
And at the end they said, “You’re actually one of the best students we’ve had the last few years because you knew what you knew and you knew what you didn’t know”\\\
That division puts such an emphasis on not going outside your lane, not speaking about something, not speculating about something that you didn’t know and trying to pass it off like you did \\\
A good metric is if a person is willing to know their scope and not feel the need to comment on every single thing\\\
Advice to avoid (these people probably aren’t experts) \\\
Also avoid people who use tips, tricks, hacks, 5 things to never do, 5 things to always do\\\
Avoid people who use superlatives‒ the best, the worst (that’s not how experts talk)\\\
Layne often says, “There’s no solutions, there’s only trade-offs.  There’s certain tools that make a lot more sense depending on somebody’s goals and where they’re at than compared to somebody else and vice versa.”\\\
Navigating social media \\\
This suggests that social media is negatively selecting, because the flare for showmanship, tips, tricks, and listicles get attention\\\
The algorithm likes things that get a lot of attention even if it isn’t warranted\\\
Social media adds another layer of confusion to this difficult topic\\\
When he scrolls through Instagram, he’s amazed at how much it’s trying to push to him\\\
Social media also acts as an information silo\\\
If you follow a few people and then accounts that are suggested to you, you’re not actually getting broader information\\\
Previously in the ‘80s, ‘90s, and 2000s when you would come across people with differences of opinion you could have a conversation with them\\\
It was not as confrontational\\\
 Now we have whole generations of people who are not used to seeing opinions/ thoughts/beliefs different than their own because they’re in those information silos, and when they get exposed to something different, they just don’t know how to handle it\\\
Layne has seen some really extreme responses to advice on nutrition\\\
He can’t name how many times he’s been called a shill for big meat, big dairy, artificial sweeteners, big sugar, etc. \\\
He just has a different opinion based on the data, but people think he must be a bad person\\\
Peter notes, “You’re an interesting person because your personality on Twitter and your personality on Instagram are quite different, and your personality in real life is totally different.”\\\
How has Layne’s personality evolved on Twitter and Instagram? \\\
Layne just made the decision that he’s not going to get drawn into it\\\
He doesn’t really look at comments on Twitter anymore\\\
Post and ghost\\\
Peter sees enough negative comments to want to eviscerate them with words but 99.9% of the time he refrains from doing so\\\
Layne thinks his styles isn’t for everybody\\\
He has the most vitriol for people who post misinformation and clearly have a pattern of behavior where that is being monetized\\\
He has very little sympathy for those who prey on the desperation and ignorance of people\\\
This probably comes from his experience being bullied as a kid\\\
It also evolved out of his coaching experience, seeing many people come to him feeling broken because they tried so many of these things touted as a solution/ cure, and when it didn’t work for them, they thought something was wrong with them\\\
“Nothing’s wrong with you. You haven’t been executing on principles that work.”‒ Layne Norton \\\
Layne has tried to dial it back a bit because he thinks he took it too far at some point\\\
Now he tries to use it to be funny and get some attention\\\
His best Instagram posts are screenshots of his Twitter\\\
One of his top rated posts was when Mark Hyman said something and his response was, “Stop making shit up”\\\
Some people would be turned off by this\\\
Other people are tired of things being overly sanitized and wish somebody would say what they really feel\\\
Layne has had so many academics reach out to him behind closed doors and say, “I love your Twitter, I love just watching you break this stuff down”\\\
Layne doesn’t attack people but provides logic, data, and citations\\\
He’s also trying to make it a funny and engaging conversation\\\
Thomas DeLauer is a great example where Layne has done several videos debunking claims he made\\\
One day Thomas reached out to him and said, “Hey man, I want you to know that I actually really respect you and you’ve actually made me change the way I think about some of this stuff. Would you want to come on my podcast?”\\\
Layne did, and their conversation is on YouTube\\\
Layne respects anybody who can be self-reflective enough to go, “You know what? I might have been wrong”, or even wanting to get a different perspective on things \\\
Layne is speaking at a low carb conference next year and the joke is, does he need to bring bodyguards?\\\
Peter is not close enough to any of the dietary communities he knows\\\
He still gets very strongly associated with a low carb ideology, which is funny when you see how many carbohydrates he eats\\\
Layne’s views on low-carb diets, the tribal nature of nutrition, and the importance of being able to change opinions [1:34:45]\\\
Layne always tells people, “How could I be anti-low-carb? If you go to our nutrition coaching app, Carbon Diet Coach, two of the six settings are low carbohydrate. There’s low carbohydrate and there’s ketogenic.” \\\
He thinks this is an example of the Tim Tebow effect, but it’s just polarization\\\
When Tim Tewbow was playing NFL football, Layne’s view was very few people were in the middle about Tim Tebow‒ you either love him or hate him\\\
But if you watch him, he’s not really that good, but he’s all right\\\
He has weird mechanics\\\
He’s more of a running back than a quarterback\\\
His completion was about 45%\\\
But many people were saying, “He’s the Heisman, he’s going to the playoffs. He’s better than your quarterback”\\\
Layne thinks this happens with many different subjects\\\
For example, Layne’s not a “car guy” but one time he took a picture of himself outside his new house with his car (a 2003 Alero) and posted it to social media\\\
This was his grad school car\\\
He never felt the need to get rid of it\\\
He got about 1500 comments, and people would ask him why he hates people who buy nice cars (he never said that)\\\
He was making a point about his ability to delay gratification and how it got him this new house \\\
Figure 2.  Layne’s “controversial” photo of his new house.  Image credit: Instagram\\\
It’s the same thing with low carb, his messaging has consistently been to refute the claim that you can eat as many calories as you want as long as it’s low carb and not gain fat\\\
Low carb does not appear to be better for fat loss than calorie protein equated diets that are not low carb\\\
“That means choose what you prefer because it’s not worse”‒ Layne Norton \\\
If you like low carb, then go ahead\\\
He doesn’t enjoy low carb but many people do\\\
One of the reasons people get so tribal about this is they find something that worked for them and then they retroactively try to find the evidence to show that it’s the best thing that there is \\\
Which is more cult-like, nutrition or exercise? \\\
Definitely nutrition\\\
Is that because of the ubiquity of food in our lives and the fact that we all have almost equally a personal relationship with food, whereas not everybody exercises the same amount?  \\\
In America, we come from a Puritan background, and there’s a thinking that anything that is pleasurable must be bad for you\\\
You can’t have it, and you should feel bad about it\\\
Layne has had people say horrible moral judgements because he posted a picture of him eating a bag of Skittles \\\
Nevermind that he just trained for 3 hours\\\
The Puritan influence is one part of this, but the bigger part is people want to validate what they already believe to be true  \\\
When Layne meets new people and they don’t know anything about him, he is hesitant to tell them about his background in nutrition (PhD in nutrition)\\\
They’ll either clam up real quick and get self-conscious about what they’re eating\\\
Even though he orders fries\\\
Or he’ll get blitzkrieged with questions\\\
If he said he was a  theoretical astrophysicist, they might talk about space a little bit, but they’re probably not going to question his beliefs or opinions on string theory\\\
But, because everyone eats and everyone knows something about their body (right or wrong), they have drawn certain conclusions about what they put in their body and what happens to their body\\\
This is why everybody has an opinion about nutrition\\\
It makes it really tough because people natively have certain beliefs, and we know how hard it is to change people’s beliefs\\\
Layne remembers a study in politics, something about George W. Bush stopped or outlawed funding for stem cell research \\\
The reality was he just stopped federal funding; he didn’t outlaw it\\\
They showed people these facts and it didn’t matter, they just reinforced their preexisting belief\\\
They had data on this for both parties, Republican or Democrat\\\
“I think it’s a people problem to be honest”‒ Layne Norton \\\
Layne recalls a benefit he gained very early on in grad school‒ Dr. Layman just absolutely dismantled so many of his beliefs\\\
But he did it in a way that wasn’t judgemental or made Layne feel bad\\\
Layne tells people, “Being wrong about something is a beautiful thing, because if I’m already right about everything, then I’m already doing everything the best I can and I can’t get better. If I’m wrong about something, that’s actually awesome because now I have something I can improve on.”\\\
Of course he likes being right\\\
But if he’s wrong, he doesn’t take much offense because it’s just data, there’s no ethical judgment\\\
He’s changed his mind about a myriad of things over the years\\\
Where Layne has changed his views: LDL cholesterol, branched-chain amino acid supplementation, intermittent fasting, and more [1:42:00]\\\
1 – LDL cholesterol \\\
It used to be about HDL: LDL ratio and the particle size\\\
Only in the last 4-5 years, after seeing enough Mendelian randomization studies did he realize the lifetime exposure to LDL is what is important\\\
The mortality rate is linear with the lifetime exposure to LDL\\\
Now he’s a little more conscious about the saturated fat he consumes, and he started taking a low dose of a statin\\\
He never had super high LDL (150-125)\\\
Even if he reduces his saturated fat and increases fiber intake\\\
He probably eats 60-70 grams of fiber a day\\\
He thinks people get that one twisted a little bit because they’ll hear things like, “It doesn’t consider HDL. It doesn’t consider this.” \\\
You have to understand what an independent risk factor means\\\
It means that all things being equal, are you better off having higher HDL? \\\
Yeah, but HDL is more of a marker of metabolic health because we have some drug trials and Mendelian randomizations now where they modulate HDL and it doesn’t really seem to make a difference\\\
Whereas a lower LDL is almost always better for cardiovascular disease and mortality\\\
Peter notes he should do a podcast on Mendelian randomization, it’s very powerful\\\
He doesn’t understand why it doesn’t get more attention\\\
You have to get into the weeds of genetic sorting and statistical methods\\\
He wrote in his book about it being one of the 5 pillars of evidence we should use to formulate insights with respect to anything \\\
Layne adds that nutrition science becomes limited when you look at mortality and cardiovascular disease\\\
The power of Mendelian randomization is you’re looking at a lifetime randomized control \\\
People point to the Minnesota coronary study (and another Australian study) to say that a randomized control trial comparing high saturated fat to low saturated fat found no difference\\\
But these studies were only for 2 years\\\
This is a long time for a clinical trial, but when you’re talking about a disease that is a lifetime exposure, you’re not going to have many incidences to pick up on in 2 years for people in their 40s\\\
Mendelian randomization allows you to get around that because you’re looking at people across their lifetimes\\\
Layne doesn’t consider himself a lipid expert, but he compares lifetime exposure risk to investing\\\
If 2 people invest $10,000, and one person gets 8% and another 6%\\\
If you only look at the difference in a year or 2, it won’t be statistically different\\\
If you look out to 4 years, the 1st person is going to have a lot more\\\
Now think how much more that is going to be over a lifetime\\\
Peter has done this exercise, it was initially in his book\\\
He compared investing $1,000 at 6% versus 4%\\\
At 5 and 10 years the difference wasn’t enormous\\\
But at 40, 50, and 60 years, it was staggering\\\
“The cumulative effect of compounding over a lifetime is so nonlinear that I don’t think we are capable of understanding it. I don’t think we can ever cognitively realize it, until we literally just do the calculations and they’re staring us in the face.”‒ Peter Attia\\\
LDL is one thing Layne has changed his mind on\\\
He still see’s LDL denialists\\\
How much more evidence do they need?\\\
Peter feels this is very dangerous\\\
The mechanism is clear‒ LDL penetration of the endothelium\\\
Animal models show linear dose independent effects\\\
Many studies support this\\\
Mendelian randomization\\\
Clinical trials in humans\\\
Prospective cohort studies\\\
Genetic studies\\\
PCSK9-over and under expressors\\\
2 – Supplemental branched chain amino acids \\\
Layne use to be a big advocate for supplemental branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)\\\
The first supplement company he started (5 years ago) sold a product with branched-amino acids in it\\\
This was basically taking 3 branched-chain amino acids as a workout supplement (as opposed to a workout recovery supplement)\\\
His current supplement company (Outwork Nutrition) does not have a branched-chain amino acid product\\\
He still thinks there may be a small benefit for delayed onset muscle soreness with branched-chain amino acids outside of regular protein, but based on the cost and negative impact on taste, it isn’t worth it\\\
Leucine tastes horrible\\\
Peter used to spike 5 g of leucine in his water during a workout and it tasted awful\\\
Are there other amino acids that taste as bad a leucine? \\\
Probably some of the sulfur ones (cysteine or methionine), but they’re non-polar so they don’t dissolve \\\
Layne was sponsored by a company called Scivation for years that had a branched-amino acid product\\\
BCAAs (branched-chain amino acids) are a big product, but most evidence based folks will say, “It’s not better than protein”\\\
Moreover, research tends to suggest that whey protein is better than branched-chains, even when you equate the dose of BCAAs in the protein\\\
Layne got to the point where he couldn’t hold the position on BCAAs and their effects on muscle supporting synthesis because evidence was just too strong\\\
3 – Intermittent fasting [1:49:15]\\\
Layne used to say he was worried about the catabolic effects of intermittent fasting (such as 16/8) when combined with resistance training and sufficient total protein\\\
Layne thinks the caveat in these studies should be that they train within their feeding window\\\
Grant Tinsley has some good studies on this\\\
There doesn’t appear to be statistical differences in lean mass between people who do 16/8 intermittent fasting versus people who eat continuously\\\
Layne used to advocate eating protein every 4 hours to improve lean mass\\\
Maybe if you plot it out over 30 years it would make a difference in how much lean mass you’re getting\\\
If you’re a bodybuilder and want to squeeze out every last ounce of muscle you can get, he still thinks any form of intermittent fasting isn’t optimal\\\
But the average person can get plenty big and strong doing 16/8 intermittent fasting\\\
Peter’s experience with intermittent fasting with his patients \\\
Peter has gone the other way on this one\\\
He used to be a big proponent \\\
But what he was seeing clinically, anecdotally, over and over again on so many patients who he had decks of data on, is a real deterioration of body composition \\\
He knows they were falling behind on protein\\\
The question became one of efficacy versus effectiveness \\\
If this were done under controlled settings where the total protein intake was identical that would be one thing\\\
Instead, the effectiveness of this in practice led to reduced protein intake\\\
Peter still uses intermittent fasting in patients as one of the 3 big levers of energy restriction\\\
But he has a big red caution button all over it to make sure patients patients are not compromising protein \\\
Nuances of intermittent fasting\\\
Layne thinks people get too hung up on the fasting part of intermittent fasting \\\
It’s a tool to reduce energy intake\\\
People ask, “Is it going to break the fast if I have coffee? Chew gum? Have a protein shake?”\\\
Peter used to really think about the details of that\\\
He thinks autophagy is an incredibly important part of our ability to regenerate, and you’re not getting any meaningful amount of it in 16 hours\\\
So now he tells patients to have a protein shake outside of that feeding window\\\
The point of intermittent fasting is energy restriction, so what’s an extra 200 calories outside of your feeding window? \\\
Layne points out that some of the effects of high protein diets are not dissimilar from fasting in terms of liver metabolism\\\
He’s concerned with having carbohydrates and fats during the fasting period (not protein)\\\
Layne and Dr. Laymen think breakfast is probably the most important meal for protein dosing of the day because you’re coming off a significant period of fasting\\\
So if you extend that with intermittent fasting, what does that mean long term?\\\
Protein intake \\\
Peter has taken to bribing his 14 year old daughter to get her to eat a minimum of 30 g of protein before she goes to school in the morning\\\
Layne thinks it’s interesting how that dogmatism plays out\\\
You have the same thing with low carb\\\
People so worried about getting any carbs, meanwhile, they’re dumping oil on their salad, putting butter in their coffee, and eating loads of bacon or they’re eating keto ice cream because it’s not spiking their blood sugar\\\
Have you looked at the keto ice cream? It’s actually more calories \\\
“We’re missing the entire point here. The same thing goes for flexible dieting. I had people who were trying to hack the system of how can I eat as much junk food as I want?”‒ Layne Norton \\\
Layne’s point is you can take anything too far\\\
We know that fiber is really important\\\
There are some folks who are anti-fiber (carnivores)\\\
Layne laughs because he was in a debate one time with a carnivore advocate and his research was sponsored by the Egg Nutrition Center, the National Dairy Council, and the National Cattleman’s Beef Association\\\
Layne adds, “The fact that I’m sitting here defending plants, is actually mind blowing to me” \\\
If anything, it should increase your trust in what he’s saying because he is a fan of high quality animal protein\\\
The carnivore diet, elimination diets, and fruits and vegetables [1:55:15]\\\
What is the argument for the carnivore diet? \\\
It’s a diet where you only eat meat\\\
Layne has heard some versions where people eat honey and fruits\\\
The reason is basically anecdotal‒ people lose weight\\\
With any strict dietary restriction you are ultimately going to reduce intake\\\
Really, how much meat can you eat?\\\
The justification is that people still go to the bathroom just fine\\\
Some people have said it helped clear up autoimmune issues\\\
That’s hard to quantify\\\
Some people say it lowered their inflammation and GI problems\\\
A lot of people get mixed up and equate getting bloated or GI dysfunction with inflammation\\\
You might have some localized inflammation, but based on what we know about IBS \\\
It’s not the same thing as getting your CRP or IL-6 measured (that’s inflammation)\\\
A carnivore diet is an elimination diet  \\\
Let’s assume that on the carnivore diet your biomarkers of inflammation improved, and symptoms improved\\\
How many foods do you think an average person eats in a given week?\\\
In the 10s, maybe 100\\\
If you eliminate all but 1 of them, it’s not a good experiment because you haven’t really learned a lot\\\
You’ve learned that something in those 99, might have been the problem\\\
Layne thinks that a lot of people who are getting benefits are basically doing an elimination diet \\\
Most people don’t have sensitivities to meat\\\
Many people, just not being in tune with their body, probably have IBS, FODMAP sensitivities where they’re fermenting a lot of fructans, oligosaccharides, those sorts of things,\\\
Even though it’s a healthy thing, bacteria getting fuel from fiber is a healthy thing\\\
If it’s causing pain, they’re equating that with being something negative\\\
Obviously, we don’t want anybody to be in pain\\\
Peter thinks a lot of people have wheat sensitivities that are not full-on gluten sensitivities\\\
That don’t rise to the level of Celiac disease\\\
Layne thinks once people have eliminated all plants from their diet, the next step should be adding things back in 1 by 1 to figure out what is actually causing problems\\\
There is a negative perception of eating animal protein in terms of longevity and health\\\
Most people who eat high amounts of animal protein aren’t eating lean cuts of sirloin and chicken breast\\\
Instead they’re eating high amounts of processed meat and less amounts of fruits and vegetables\\\
A classic study from Maximova in 2020 looked at different serving amounts of fruits and vegetables and also meats\\\
Going from high to low vegetable intake there was a liner effect on the incidence of cancer\\\
Eating more meat also shows a linear effect on the incidence of cancer when you don’t correct for fruit and vegetable intake\\\
In those who had the highest intake of meat along with the highest intake of fruits and vegetables there was no effect on cancer incidence \\\
The risk was the same as the group who at low amounts of meat and high amounts of fruits and vegetables\\\
Layne’s takeaway: “That suggests it’s less about the meat you’re eating and what you’re eating it instead of… I like high quality protein… but for God’s sake, have some fruits and vegetables with it because it’s what’s going to mitigate your risk.” \\\
When we tell people to eat more or less of something, usually a replacement happens\\\
Fiber: Layne’s approach to fiber intake, sources of fiber, benefits, and more [2:00:15]\\\
How much fiber are you eating a day, and what are your main sources?\\\
Around 60 g total (soluble + insoluble)\\\
Layne eats a lot of riced cauliflower, broccoli, beans, apples\\\
There’s about 3-4 g fiber in an apple\\\
Berries tend to be really fiber dense compared to apples\\\
Bananas have relatively low fiber, but even the higher sugar, lower fiber fruits are still associated with good health outcomes\\\
He loves popcorn; it’s high fiber\\\
You could eat more corn than popcorn; popcorn is very filling\\\
Layne started eating popcorn during body building competitions\\\
Air popped popcorn with a little cinnamon, Splenda, and butter spray\\\
For 50 g of carbohydrate, it will take you 20-30 minutes to eat it and it helped him controlhis hunger\\\
You get 6-10 g fiber depending on the brand\\\
It’s probably not as healthy as some fruits and vegetables, but as far as snacks go, i’t pretty good and very filling\\\
Layne was in a debate with Paul Saladino (a big carnivore advocate), they were talking about fiber and Paul said, “Well, this stuff with fiber, it’s just healthy user bias” \\\
People who eat more fiber have other health promoting behaviors\\\
Healthy user bias is a real thing, in terms of cohort studies, cross-sectional data, and observational data\\\
But when you’re dealing with a healthy user bias, typically the data’s not consistent\\\
One study will say one thing, one study might have no effect, one study might say a different thing\\\
You see that with meat longevity\\\
You don’t see it with exercise, smoking studies (in the opposite direction), or fiber\\\
Layne was just looking at a meta-analysis earlier, that controlled for confounding variables, and they reported that animal protein was not associated with increased mortality\\\
Fiber has a very consistent effect across all meta-analysis\\\
Even without a 10 year RCT of giving people enough fiber versus not and tracking health outcomes, Layne feels very comfortable saying that fiber helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer\\\
The RDA for fiber is 20-30 g (or 14 g per 1,000 calories of food)\\\
Layne tells people to shoot for 15 g per 1000 calories\\\
He would love to go for more, but at some point it becomes intractable to get that much fiber at low calories\\\
What about getting fiber from bars and things? \\\
Layne is eating real food to get fiber\\\
Peter has heard things that suggest the fiber in a processed bar is not contributing to health the way fiber in food such as cauliflower or beans does\\\
Layne tries not to fall into the naturalistic fallacy\\\
He cringes when he cringes processed and unprocessed because everything is processed now\\\
Peter doesn’t meant to say that processing is bad, but is thinking about this through the lens of destruction of the actual kernel and what that does at the GLP-1 level\\\
Layne replies, “Mother nature’s kitchen is probably better than a fiber bar that’s some indigestible form of glucose or some less digestible form of starchy carbohydrate”\\\
But, is a processed bar better than nothing? Probably\\\
He also thinks that eating 3 protein bars that have 14 grams of fiber is probably not equivalent to getting 6-8 servings of fruits and vegetables\\\
Confusion around omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and the Minnesota Coronary Experiment [2:05:00]\\\
Peter notes, “There’s nothing in nutrition that I’m more confused about than the role of Omega-6 PUFAs”\\\
The Minnesota coronary experiment \\\
The Minnesota coronary experiment (mentioned earlier) was very unique and probably will never be replicated\\\
It would never get approved now\\\
Peter is still trying to track down Chris Ramsden who wrote the paper on all that data that was never published in Franz’s first study\\\
This study was carried out in a mental facility\\\
What makes it special is that the subjects were fed every meal\\\
It was not a free living study, though it had free living duration\\\
The average duration was just over 2 years\\\
The study was conducted over 4.5 years\\\
1568 participants were on the diet for over 2 years\\\
The diet had a big reduction in saturated fat\\\
Saturated fat was reduced by 50%, from 18.5% of calories to 9.2%\\\
Corn oil was used to replace cooking oil and used in many foods\\\
Corn oil margarine was used in place of butter\\\
The hypothesis being tested was that the group on the lower saturated fat diet should have fewer cardiovascular events\\\
This was at the time (1961) when Ancel Keys proposed that saturated fat was the driver of blood lipids (the lipid heart hypothesis) \\\
This was a large study, over 500 subjects\\\
The original publication stated 1568 participants were on the diet for over 2 years\\\
Ramsden’s paper reports 2355 participants\\\
The participants in this study were old which meant you were going to see events\\\
Peter notes, “You couldn’t do a 2-year study in 40 year olds. You’d see no events in anybody.”\\\
The results came out in 1973 but there weren’t published until 1989 (16 years later)\\\
When asked about this Franz says, “We didn’t like the way it turned out”\\\
A guy named Chris Ramsden who is still at the NIH come along 5 years ago and finds a bunch of unpublished data and republishes it in BMJ \\\
Peter’s interpretation of this study 10 years ago was that saturated fats are not causing heart disease, but now his interpretation is that the study wasn’t long enough to see a difference \\\
In this study they measured total cholesterol levels but didn’t fractionate cholesterol\\\
So they couldn’t measure LDL or HDL\\\
Still, there was a 30 mg/dL reduction in total cholesterol in the low saturated fat group\\\
The majority of that 30 mg/dL was probably LDL-cholesterol if they could have measured it \\\
Peter’s interpretation now is that a 2-year intervention is not long enough \\\
If you put a bunch of people on a statin for 2 years, you probably wouldn’t see a difference\\\
Now, the PCSK9 trials suggest otherwise\\\
The ODYSSEY and FOURIER trials in 2015 tested the most potent lipid lowering drugs and did show a benefit in 2.5-3 years, but they were crushing LDL\\\
The modifications you can make to cholesterol from diet (in some cases) can be quite small compared to what you can get with pharmaceutical interventions \\\
For an extreme example, if somebody went on a diet of zero saturated fat, 12% total fat, calorie restriction‒ they could probably cut their cholesterol in half, but they’d be doing a bunch of harm along the way\\\
On the other end of the spectrum, some people in the low-carb community are bragging about LDL-cholesterol levels in the 500s\\\
It’s much easier to raise your LDL-cholesterol with diet\\\
It’s an unbounded problem above and a bounded problem below\\\
Ramsden’s data suggests that people in the PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) group had worse outcomes\\\
This throws Peter for a loop and  is why he wants to have Chris Ramsden on the podcast\\\
If the details of that study are consistent, it would be the most damning evidence against N6 PUFAs in terms of lowering lipids but raising cardiac events\\\
There’s a precedent for this, a drug (triparanol) approved in the 60s lowered cholesterol but increased cardiovascular events (it was withdrawn)\\\
The drug was believed to prevent the conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol (the final step of cholesterol synthesis in 1 of 2 pathways)\\\
Perhaps desmosterol acted as bad or worse than cholesterol, in terms of the oxidative process\\\
Today cholesterol drugs are only approved on the basis of outcomes (like lower cardiac events), but then it was approved on the basis of cholesterol lowering\\\
The point is, there is a precedent for lowering cholesterol and worsening events \\\
Ramsden proposes a series of mechanisms by which that might be the case with at least this polyunsaturated fat\\\
Conversely, there is a lot of epidemiology that says the opposite, that whenever you substitute saturated for polyunsaturated fats, things get better\\\
Nobody’s disputing MUFA (monounsaturated fatty acids)\\\
The data seems unambiguously clear that MUFA is the best of the 3 fats, both epidemiologically and experimentally\\\
Layne’s views on fats in the diet [2:13:00]\\\
How does Layne think about the distribution of fats in the diet? \\\
Layne has seen some epidemiology that showed PUFAs were lowering events more\\\
They are more favorable than SFA\\\
Studies that have swayed his opinion were those that had other contextual data where their findings made sense\\\
One study came out and concluded they don’t know how to reconcile their findings because the mechanisms proposed for Omega-6 fats are they will increase inflammation because their double bonds can be oxidized\\\
The oxidation causes inflammation\\\
But if you look at the hard outcome data and RCTs where they give oleic or alpha linoleic acid, you don’t see inflammation go up if they’re not increasing total calories\\\
In particular, if they replace it for saturated fat, you sometimes see inflammation go down\\\
“So I don’t feel bad saying, I just have no clue”‒ Peter Attia\\\
Layne looks at the weight of the evidence and couples it with mechanistic evidence and human outcome mechanisms\\\
Maybe we can’t do a 2 year randomized control trial, but 12 weeks is enough time to see differences in inflammation \\\
It’s been a long time since Peter looked through the BMJ paper (Minnesota coronary experiment), but he recalls a figure that walks through the proposed mechanisms (shown below)\\\
Figure 3.  Potential consequences of high linoleic acid intake.  Image credit: BMJ 2016\\\
What have we added to our diet in the last 20-30 years? \\\
When you think of cutting something out, you replace it with other things\\\
Layne thinks the biggest contribution to added calories in the diet in the last 20-30 years is oils \\\
“The big demon right now is seed oils”‒ Layne Norton\\\
The anti-seed oil crowd is just so vitriolic and so nuts that Layne wonders if he wants to wade into this conversation\\\
They’re definitely more toward the low-carb carnivore\\\
There’s a lot of people in the low carb community who’ve tried to abdicate saturated fat\\\
They will say that people who have higher LDL-cholesterol live longer\\\
Layne thinks that’s probably because they’re actually eating enough food\\\
When you’re elderly, the problem is wasting not obesity\\\
As people wanted to make saturated fat a “good guy,” seed oils became the “bad guy” \\\
If you look at the top-level stuff, it fits a pretty good story\\\
We never ate seed oils 120 years ago\\\
Today they’re a huge part of our fat calories and look at all the things that are wrong with the world today\\\
It’s the same story for sugar\\\
We ate this much sugar in 1900 and this much in 2000\\\
Look what got worse\\\
It’s really easy to make sugar a boogeyman\\\
Layne’s takeaway: I think when you look through the data and try to be unbiased about it, the continuous boogeyman is just energy toxicity \\\
Problems arise when you’re dealing with extra energy\\\
People will say they did the food guide pyramid, but they didn’t really do it because it also said exercise and reduce your calorie consumption \\\
They added in more carbohydrates, but didn’t really decrease their fat intake\\\
So we added more calories and had more of these problems \\\
Flexible dieting, calorie tracking, and the benefits of tracking what you eat to understand your baseline [2:18:00]\\\
Peter finds it impossible to estimate what he eats; there’s no way he could tell you within 500 calories what he’s eaten in a day\\\
He thinks in the low fat craze, we probably underestimated how much fat didn’t go down and how much low fat stuff went up\\\
Density in food calories comes from fat\\\
Fat will take a dish from 500 calories to 1500 calories\\\
Can Layne look at a brownie or sandwich and know how many calories he’s getting? \\\
He’s done enough food logging in his life\\\
For some people, that’s not a sustainable way to live\\\
The bigger picture is, “If you want to lose fat or control body weight, you have to practice some form of restriction” \\\
You can pick the form of restriction you want \\\
1 – Restrict calories\\\
Restrict portion size\\\
2 – Restrict time\\\
3 – Restrict a certain macronutrient group\\\
4 – Only eat minimally processed food\\\
For Layne, the easiest thing is to eat what he wants within reason (control the amount)\\\
If you do that, you’re going to have to track calories or macros or whatever\\\
What’s interesting is none of these forms of restriction seem to be better than another in terms of adherence at a population level \\\
“Choose the form of restriction that feels the least restrictive for you”‒ Layne Norton \\\
Other forms of restriction Layne has tried \\\
He tried clean eating back in the early 2000s\\\
This focused on minimally processed foods and high fiber\\\
He kind of started binge eating then\\\
The psychology of binge eating is really interesting\\\
Layne had Professor Jake Linardon on his podcast a while back (an expert in eating disorders), and he said 2 theres are essential for an eating disorder to emerge\\\
1 – Some sort of poor body image perception\\\
2 – Hard food rules\\\
So when you create hard food rules, it just does a weird thing in your mind \\\
Binging just means overeating, but Layne doesn’t know the actual criteria\\\
It’s periods of intense food consumption followed by a lot of guilt\\\
We’re not talking about having an extra cookie\\\
We’re talking about eating a whole box of Oreos\\\
For Layne the rules for what was clean to eat seemed very arbitrary\\\
The Bodybuilding Magazine said he couldn’t have sugar or this or that\\\
As he started to avoid these “bad foods” he actually started eating more of them because when he was exposed to them he wasn’t able to moderate it\\\
“I would just end up eating way more than I had intended to or even felt hungry for” \\\
He had the mindset that if it is bad, he’s not going to eat it again\\\
It became, “This is my last time eating this cause I’m going to be really serious after this. So since I’ve already broken the seal, might as well just go all way.”\\\
He realized it was ineffective towards his goals\\\
He wondered if the problem was having pizza or eating an entire large pizza, and that’s when he decided to try portion control\\\
“I was able to modulate my body composition by eating foods I still enjoyed but controlling portion size”‒ Layne Norton \\\
Flexible dieting and tracking macros \\\
Layne began practices flexible dieting which involves tracking macros, kind of treating it like a budget\\\
About 7-8 years ago he was going to debate a bodybuilding coach about clean eating versus flexible dieting\\\
In his opening argument Layne looked on the guy’s Facebook page and compared the weekly calories of his meals to the calories Layne ate each week (including junk food)\\\
His calories were higher\\\
Layne’s point was this guy was telling him it was really bad to have a cookie, but if he binged on it 1 day a week, that’s okay\\\
This seemed like an odd metric\\\
The calorie comparison is very different\\\
What fraction of the population would have the best physical and psychological response to calorie restriction as a tool or flexible dieting? \\\
There’s no data on this, but from Layne’s experience with clients, some people will be resistant at first then really enjoy it later\\\
It all boils down to how willing somebody is to make this part of their lifestyles\\\
All forms of restriction have downsides\\\
If you’re on a ketogenic diet and you go out to eat, there’s a lot you can’t eat, but you can usually make do\\\
If you’re on time restricted feeding you can join your friends for a breakfast out\\\
With flexible dieting you have to keep track of what you eat\\\
Data on food reporting consistently show people under report by 50%\\\
People take this stat as an affront, “I’m not a liar”\\\
Instead people are just really horrible estimators of what they eat\\\
Layne adds, “If you ever want to be depressed, go weigh-out of serving of cereal, or a serving of ice cream, or a serving of peanut butter”\\\
A serving of ice cream is not a bowl of ice cream\\\
A bowl of ice cream is probably 3 servings, so it makes sense why people underestimate their energy intake\\\
Even if you don’t practice flexible dieting, tracking and weighing every single thing you put in your mouth for a week is an incredibly valuable tool because it will teach you about portion control and you’ll learn more about nutrition in that week than you would doing anything else \\\
A lot of people don’t want to do it for the same reason a lot of people don’t want to keep a budget for their money\\\
They don’t want to know\\\
They don’t want to see where’ they’ve been spending money\\\
Layne has had many people tell him, “I’m eating 1500 calories a day and can’t lose weight”\\\
Peter finds it hard to believe you can’t lose weight on 1500 calories\\\
Layne recalls a metabolic ward study where they put people on 1500 calories and 1 person gained a tiny amount of weight, but the majority lost weight\\\
The point is, it’s useful for people to track what they eat for a while\\\
People who have never tracked before are stunned to find out what they are eating\\\
Layne’s app is different from a calorie tracking app because it gives you macros to eat based on your dietary preference and goals\\\
It will adjust them based on how you’re progressing, so it’s not just a one and done calculation\\\
When Layne first started doing this he would bring a book of food counts with him to the grocery store, but now he’s been doing it for 20 years\\\
So when he picks up a brownie, he knows the calorie density is going to be similar to other brownies\\\
The carb and fat ratio might be a bit different\\\
He put it in the app as a random brownie from Sara Lee or whatever\\\
The apps now make it much easier to track\\\
He really tries to think about what something weighs \\\
The brownie was about 40 g\\\
Does Layne track everything he eats? \\\
Peter and Layne went out to dinner 2 nights ago, and Peter didn’t see Layne put anything in the app\\\
He did it after\\\
How did you remember what we ate and like the bone marrow and all that crazy stuff we were eating? \\\
There was an entry for bone marrow he found\\\
It’s very likely that some of these are inaccurate, but it’s going to be more accurate than jus saying, “Well, I have not idea, so I’m not going to worry about it”\\\
Do you think the act of tracking helps you put a governor on what you eat? \\\
Did the fact that you had to enter 40 g of brownie prevent you from having 3 brownies? \\\
At this point for Layne, no; but for some people, absolutely\\\
One of the most basic laws of science is when you monitor something, it changes\\\
When Layne talks to people who can’t lose weight, he emphasizes that he doesn’t expect people to track their food forever\\\
For just 1 week, track everything that you put into your mouth\\\
Weigh it on a scale\\\
When people do this 1 of 2 things happens\\\
1 – They come back and are shocked that they were eating 2,900 calories\\\
Layne tells them, “Welcome to freedom. Because now you know that you’re not broken, you can modify”\\\
2 – They actually eat the amount of calories they said they were eating, and they lose 3 lbs\\\
“What [gets] monitored is what gets changed”‒ Layne Norton \\\
When you get people to monitor thing, they change their behavior\\\
The nutritional demands of preparing for a bodybuilding show [2:30:45]\\\
Changes Layne makes when preparing for a bodybuilding show \\\
He can’t guesstimate on what he puts into his diet tracking app; he gets more granular\\\
When he goes out to eat, the sacrifice might be that he takes all the ingredients, put them on a scale and tracks it\\\
The other sacrifice is he can’t go out with his friends anymore\\\
He adds, “In the last four weeks I’m pretty much a hermit”\\\
“All these different forms of restriction are just tools”‒ Layne Norton \\\
Layne thinks it’s really educational for folks who have never tracked what they eat to try it\\\
You’ll learn so much about portion sizes\\\
You’ll go, “Whoa, I didn’t realize that restaurants serve such massive portion sizes”\\\
Layne can’t count how many times he’s been eating something really good and gone, “I don’t need anymore”\\\
Are you still hungry when you push it away? \\\
Being in tune with your hunger signals plus some bit of monitoring is helpful\\\
But that’s also hard when you’re eating processed food, energy dense, hyper palatable food\\\
Previously, we could auto-regulate what we ate based on our hunger signals because we were in a situation where food wasn’t energy dense enough\\\
You would become uncomfortable based on the volume of food you were eating\\\
Even up to 1950, you had to walk down to the bakery to get processed, energy dense, hyperpalatable food (it wasn’t readily available)\\\
Serving sizes were a lot smaller then too\\\
Dinner plates in the early 1900s are much smaller than they are now\\\
Peter relates this to traveling in Europe, “No matter how many times I go to Italy or something like that, I can’t get over how small the portions are. And it’s really wonderful because I’m just a glutton.” \\\
Part of growing up as an immigrant kid was you ate what was on your plate\\\
He can’t recall how many times he got the lecture about not wasting food, and kids in Africa that don’t have anything\\\
The clean plate was just part of your mindset\\\
Do you think you’ll do another bodybuilding show? [2:33:45]\\\
Right now, Layne is in a long season off\\\
He has a lot of things going on business wise (he’s very grateful for that)\\\
He’s hoping to get to the point where he’s working because he wants to work not because he feels like he has to work\\\
That’s the dream\\\
He loves what he does\\\
He doesn’t see himself ever retiring, but it would be nice to have a little more freedom to go and do the things he’s super passionate about \\\
Bodybuilding and getting ready for a show takes a significant amount of time and energy\\\
Powerlifting already does that, but he can powerlift without the brain fog, mood swings, etc.\\\
Case studies of bodybuilders at a show report they are hypogonadal by the time they hit stage\\\
Layne has measured his testosterone probably half a dozen times in the last 5 years\\\
The lowest has been 900\\\
The highest was almost 1100\\\
When he was competing in bodybuilding, it was under 300 when he was close to a show\\\
His LH and FSH is normal\\\
“Think about the hungriest you’ve ever been in your life and now imagine that feeling doesn’t leave you for weeks and the lowest energy”‒ Layne Norton \\\
What’s the absolute nadir of calories you’re consuming at the lowest?  \\\
At his level of lean mass, 1900 calories a day\\\
260 g protein\\\
Around 100 g carbohydrate (or less)\\\
30-40 g fat\\\
What does that look like practically? What actual foods are you eating? \\\
Egg whites, chicken breast, some fat-free Greek yogurt\\\
You have to be very careful with your fats when you’re that low calorie\\\
Even eating something that has 7 g of fat (which by all accounts is a low fat item), you have to be careful because those grams can sneak up very quickly\\\
Can you have nuts? \\\
Oh, no\\\
Low energy is a real problem \\\
Before a show he struggles with very low energy\\\
He remembers sitting on the couch after training, the remote control was probably 5 feet away, and the Real Housewives was playing (a show he abhors)\\\
He sat and watched the entire show because he was not willing to get up and get the remote\\\
That’s how exhausted he was\\\
How many weeks were you into calorie restriction at that point? \\\
20 weeks in (not at 1900 calories)\\\
His calories have progressively come down\\\
It’s a body fat issue\\\
He’s had clients who were able to eat higher calories and get really lean\\\
At a certain point of body fat, it doesn’t matter if you are lean and your leptin is low, your testosterone is low\\\
Eric Helms describes contest prep as like you’re circling a drain and you’re just trying to delay going down the drain as long as possible, but eventually you go down the drain\\\
How do you get the energy to get on stage?  Do you have one big push of carbs shortly before you go on stage? \\\
There are spurts where you feel okay\\\
It’s not too difficult for Layne to go from 15% body fat on calipers to 7%\\\
He had gone up a weight class in powerlifting a few years ago and then came back down\\\
This was a 30 lb weight drop\\\
The lowest he ever calipered was 2%, but it was probably more like 5-6%\\\
To go from 7% to 3% or 2% is infinitely more difficult\\\
The best way to describe it‒ think of getting toothpaste out of the tube\\\
It’s easy with a fresh tube\\\
But as that toothpaste tube gets emptier and emptier, you have to expend more and more effort to squeeze out that last little bit of toothpaste\\\
Contest prep is very much like that\\\
But you do have times when you have energy because you still have to train 2-3 hours a day\\\
The part of contest prep Layne despises is he gets to a point where he doesn’t like training anymore\\\
He continues with it for energy expenditure and to retain muscle\\\
He loses his passion for it, and he’s somebody who loves to train (it’s his favorite thing in the world)\\\
He did periodize his nutrition so he would have some higher calorie days on days that were more demanding for training\\\
These were usually lower body training days\\\
Water \\\
As far as getting on stage, one thing he never cuts for bodybuilding shows is water\\\
A lot of people cut water\\\
Layne thinks this is silly because a muscle is 70% water and in your native state you keep more water inside your muscle cell than you do outside your muscle cell\\\
If you begin removing more fluid via a diuretic or fluid restriction/ sodium restriction, you remove it in the same proportion from the subcutaneous layer and the intracellular layer \\\
All you’re going to do is become flatter overall\\\
In the intravascular layer, you get hypertensive\\\
Not cutting water helped Layne with his energy\\\
He was never dehydrated\\\
He didn’t cut sodium or take a diuretic\\\
Are diuretics legal in testing? \\\
You could take OTC diuretics like dandelion root and those sorts of things\\\
The logic behind why people cut water and sodium is funny\\\
It’s like somebody saw a figure of the sodium-potassium pump in a book and reasoned, the cell wants to get sodium out and potassium in, let’s cut sodium and load potassium\\\
The physiology is‒ if you get the sodium to potassium ratio too low, it will cause you to retain water as well\\\
Food the week before a show \\\
During peak week, food went back up\\\
If you’re still trying to lose body fat that close to a show, it’s probably not going to go well for you\\\
In peak week, he’ll usually start to feel better as opposed to worse\\\
On the day of the show he’ll have 300-400 g carbohydrate\\\
A lot of the dogmas in bodybuilding originated in wrestling and endurance running\\\
The correlation was, wrestlers cut water and look really lean, so we should cut water\\\
Layne points to the example of Georges St-Pierre, when he weighed in, he looked gaunt\\\
He didn’t look healthy, not very muscular\\\
And then the day of the fight (24 hours later), he looked like a bodybuilder\\\
That shows you what drinking water, eating enough sodium and carbohydrate will do for your muscle fullness because muscles are 70% water \\\
Layne thinks not beating his body up with fluid restriction helped him have a little more longevity in bodybuilding/powerlifting\\\
The psychological effects of aging and changes to one’s identity [2:42:00]\\\
How do you think about aging in terms of reduction in strength and change in physique?  What do you think about being 60 or 70? \\\
This is obviously an important part of Layne’s identity\\\
He is 40 now\\\
Of course he will struggle with it\\\
For any athlete, that is part of your identity for a long period of your life\\\
Layne feels fortunate in that he has had multiple identities\\\
Academic, influencer, entrepreneur, powerlifter, bodybuilder, scientist, a dad\\\
He thinks it will be a little easier for him because he already has other things he cares about\\\
Of course it will be hard, nobody whose successful doesn’t have any ego whatsoever\\\
When he loads up a bar with 500 lbs in a commercial gym and is squatting, “that part of me feels like a badass”\\\
There will be part of him that misses that\\\
His goal is not to be the guy who benched 405 (or whatever it is) or squatted 600 until his knees hurt\\\
I  think really what’s going to be most important for me is just trying to not judge it and just find other things that I can be interested in \\\
He will still always lift, always train\\\
He loves it too much not to do it\\\
It makes him feel food\\\
He got a great complement at the gym the other day when he casually brought up that he turned 40 this year\\\
A lady was  like, what? “I would’ve guessed that you were like mid-30s” \\\
Layne thinks resistance training is one of the best things you can to to keep you young\\\
Some of the bodybuilders out there still look really good into their 50s if they continue to do it\\\
Jay Cutler is in his 40s\\\
He trains every day and still eats really well\\\
