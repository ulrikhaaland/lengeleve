He started with calipers, which is not the most objective standard and highly dependent on the skill of the individual doing the test. He then switched to hydrostatic testing, which turned out to be pretty inaccurate. Late 2011, Peter switched over to DEXA scanning, which is the gold standard. DEXA is very good at giving total body fat because it’s very accurate at measuring fat. Total body fat divided by total body weight is your body fat percentage.",

The reality with keto is that it’s very difficult to get there if you’re consuming sufficient protein. If you’re hitting one gram of protein per pound of body weight, you are invariably kicking off some of that protein into gluconeogenesis, which is effectively raising glucose and kicking you out of ketosis.
