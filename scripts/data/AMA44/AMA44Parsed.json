He now recommends DEXA scanning as the gold standard for accuracy. DEXA scans can accurately measure bone, fat, and muscle mass. Peter emphasizes the importance of monitoring visceral adipose tissue (VAT), which is a problematic compartment of fat outside of subcutaneous stores. He also looks at bone mineral density, appendicular lean mass index (ALMI), and fat-free mass index (FFMI) to assess muscle mass.",

He is also not planning to incorporate longer term fasting back in his life at the same frequency he used to. He believes that health should be indexed over weight and that fasting can have negative effects on body composition.",

    "content": "Peter Attia's case study focused heavily on weight, but it also showed some of the effects that go beyond that, such as visceral fat and lean mass. The most interesting insight was how much the effect of fasting, long consistent fasting had on body composition in a negative way. It is important to look at things in context and not just focus on body weight.",
