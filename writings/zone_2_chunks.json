The U.S. EPA’s safety limit for NO2 is 100 parts per billion (ppb), and they estimate that ambient air averages about 53 ppb. Previous work has shown that NO2 levels in homes with gas stoves typically range from 25-75 ppb, or about 15-25 ppb more than homes without gas stoves. According to a study at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the most effective strategy is to employ a range hood while cooking. The authors report that use of a range hood eliminated 60-87% of NO2 associated with stove use.",

Furthermore, there is no better place to find stillness than in nature. To that end, walking (in nature) with zero agenda—not doing so to “get a workout” or “see something” specific—may be one of the best tools for finding this elusive state.",

Themes throughout the conversation include the difference between science and advocacy, the messaging which is sowing mistrust in science despite major progress, and a search for what a possible “end” to this situation might look like.",
